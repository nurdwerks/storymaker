## Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall

### Scene 1: The Refinement / Sector 4, The Crash Site

- **Key Event:** The group stumbles upon a luxury "Gilded-Class" escape pod embedded in a pile of rubble. It didn't launch correctly; it just fell off the side of the Spire like a dropped diamond.
- **Key Event:** The hatch, engraved with the crest of **House Silver**, hisses open.
- **Key Event:** Lady Corinne emerges. She is pristine, a stark contrast to the ash-coated world. She wears a gown of spun "whisper-silk" that shimmers with holographic constellations.
- **Key Event:** She coughs delicately into a fan made of razor-glass, shielding her nose from the smell of burning ozone and sewage.
- **Key Event:** Seeing Angelica and the group, she smiles—not with relief, but with expectation. She assumes they are the rescue party.
- **Key Event:** She extends a hand, expecting to be helped down from the wreckage.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Attempts to pull rank on Ria, demanding to be escorted to the "proper authorities." She genuinely believes the social hierarchy survived the literal collapse of the world.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "You there, the armored one. Be a dear and fetch my luggage. It's the platinum trunk. And do hurry, the air down here is positively corrosive to one's complexion."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "I am Corinne of House Silver. You will take me to my father. Immediately. I have a dinner reservation at the Spire at eight."

### Scene 2: The Reality / The Crash Site

- **Key Event:** Ria stares at Corinne. The soldier is covered in mud, blood, and hydraulic fluid. She looks at the silk dress, then at the useless high-heeled shoes floating on dying anti-grav repulsors.
- **Key Event:** Ria ignores the hand. She steps _past_ Corinne, shoving her aside with a shoulder plate to get to the pod's open panel.
- **Key Event:** Corinne gasps, more offended by the rudeness than the violence. "Excuse me! Did you not hear me? I am a Daughter of the Silver!"
- **Key Event:** Ria rips a panel off the wall, exposing the pod's power, cells. "House Silver doesn't exist anymore," she grunts, yanking a heavy lithium battery free. "But these do. Step aside, Duchess."
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches, leaning on her makeshift staff. She sees the confusion in Corinne's violet eyes. It's the look of a zoo animal released into the wild—terrified and completely unable to comprehend that the glass wall is gone.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Corinne):** It must be a mistake. A drill. The Emperor would not let the sky fall. Her father would not leave her. This dirty woman in the riot armor is lying. She has to be.

### Scene 3: The Hunger / The Ruins of Sector 4

- **Key Event:** Night falls. The temperature drops thirty degrees. Corinne's silk dress offers no warmth. She shivers violently, her "fiber-optic" hair turning a distressed, pale blue.
- **Key Event:** The group gathers around a small chemical fire. Hatcher opens a can of military-grade "Nutri-Paste." It is grey, gelatinous, and smells like wet cardboard and engine oil.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher passes the tin to Corinne. "Eat," he grunts.
- **Key Event:** Corinne stares at it. Her stomach cramps, but her revulsion is stronger. She has dined on cloud-cakes and nectar-wine her entire life.
- **Key Event:** "I can't," she whispers, pushing it away. "It smells like... oil. It's animal feed."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** _(Laughing)_ "Animal feed is for animals with futures. My dog wouldn't eat that. But you? You're dinner for the rats if you don't keep your calories up."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Eat or don't. The paste doesn't care. The cold doesn't care. And honestly? I don't care."
- **Key Event:** Corinne looks around the circle. No one contradicts him. Even Angelica is eating the sludge with grim efficiency.
- **Key Event:** Corinne realizes, with a jolt of horror, that her beauty—her currency—buys nothing here. There is no audience to charm. There is only the calorie count.
- **Key Event:** She dips a manicured finger into the grey slime. She puts it in her mouth. She gags, tears streaming down her face, but she swallows. It is the first un-beautiful thing she has ever done.

### Scene 4: The Join / The Ruins

- **Key Event:** Morning brings a grey, toxic light. The group packs up to move toward the Foundation signal.
- **Key Event:** Corinne stands, smoothing her dress. "Well," she says, voice trembling slightly. "I suppose I shall accompany you. Until I find a working comms tower to call my shuttle."
- **Key Event:** Angelica tosses a heavy canvas bag at Corinne's feet. It lands with a metallic _clank_. It is full of the lithium batteries Ria salvaged.
- **Key Event:** "My shuttle?" Corinne asks, blinking.
- **Key Event:** "Your ticket," Angelica says. Her eyes are not unkind, but they are hard. "We don't carry passengers. We carry crew."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Shows a cold kind of mercy. She knows that if she lets Corinne walk empty-handed, the others will leave her behind at the first sign of trouble. Work is value. Value is survival.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You want a future? Carry the batteries. That's your ticket. No work, no walk."
- **Key Event:** Corinne stares at the bag. It probably weighs thirty pounds. She has never lifted anything heavier than a champagne glass.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the empty horizon. She looks at the retreating backs of the group.
- **Key Event:** With a whimper of effort, Corinne bends down. She breaks a nail hooking the strap. She heaves the bag onto her delicate shoulder, the strap digging into her skin.
- **Key Event:** She takes a step. Her anti-grav heels whine and die, grounding her. She stumbles, then rights herself. She follows.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Corinne):** The weight forces her spine to bend. It is heavy, ugly, and painful. But as she walks, she realizes something else. She isn't floating anymore. She can feel the ground. The vibrating, broken metal of the ship beneath her feet. For the first time in her life, she is connected to the world, not suspended above it. And it is terrifying.
- **Key Event:** She wipes a smear of soot from her cheek. She keeps walking. She keeps carrying the weight.
