## Chapter 30: The Fall

### Scene 1: The Siege

- **Key Event:** The location is the roof of the Sector 4 Broadcast Tower. It is a flat plasteel platform, wind-whipped and exposed, 100 stories above the burning Undercity.
- **Key Event:** The team is pinned down behind the heavy broadcast equipment banks.
- **Key Event:** Vane’s Praetorian Guard—elite soldiers in white ceramic armor—are breaching the stairwell door. They are using "Suppression Emitters" that dampen sound and light.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher is slumped against a cooling unit. His left shoulder is a ruin of blood and shredded trench coat fabric. He has taken a plasma bolt meant for Angelica.
- **Key Event:** Despite the wound, Hatcher is firing his "Widowmaker" revolver one-handed. The massive gun booms like thunder, a distinct, analog sound against the digital whine of the enemy's energy weapons.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He checks his matchstick, switches it to the other side of his mouth, and keeps firing. He is pale, sweating, and dying, but he refuses to stop being useful.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Go! Getting shot is the only cardio I get these days. Don't waste it!"

### Scene 2: The Dropship

- **Key Event:** A shadow falls over the tower. It is Prelate Vane’s personal flagship, _The Absolution_. It is a sleek, white teardrop of a ship that hangs silently in the air.
- **Key Event:** The bay doors open. Prelate Vane descends on a gravity-disc. He is flanked by his "Nulls"—cyborgs with no faces, only sensor arrays.
- **Key Event:** Vane’s presence has a physical effect on the environment. The "Gluttony" bond radiates from him. The moss growing on the tower vents turns black and crumbles to dust. The metal railings rust instantly.
- **Key Event:** He lands on the roof. The Praetorians stop firing and kneel, their armor clanking in unison. The sound is like a church service for war.
- **Key Event:** Vane’s presence has a physical effect on the environment. The "Gluttony" bond radiates from him like heat from a furnace. But instead of burning, it _consumes_.
- **Key Event:** The moss growing on the tower vents turns black and crumbles to dust, its nutrients sucked into the air. The metal railings rust instantly, flakes of oxidized iron drifting away like snow. The air itself feels thin, as if the oxygen is being inhaled by a god.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher coughs, clutching his chest. He can feel his own energy draining, his blood sugar bottoming out just by being in Vane's proximity.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He looks at the chaos—the blood, the fire, the bodies—and he looks bored. He adjusts his gloves, ensuring not a spec of ash touches his pristine white uniform. To him, this isn't a battle; it's a pest control appointment that ran late.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "So much noise. You have delivered your message, Angelica. But did anyone listen? Or did you just shout into the void?"

### Scene 3: The Offer

- **Key Event:** Vane raises a hand. The Nulls aim their weapons.
- **Key Event:** He offers a deal. He points to the golden cylinder case strapped to Angelica’s back.
- **Key Event:** If she gives him the Cylinder (the Truth), he will let her friends live. He will even let Hatcher get medical attention.
- **Key Event:** If she refuses, he will kill them slowly, starting with the "pet thief" (Zephyr).
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at Zephyr. Zephyr is terrified. His bond counter is flashing red.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks at the Cylinder. He knows it is worth more than his life. He knows it is the only thing that can save the ship.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr shakes his head. He steps in front of Angelica, shielding her with his body.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — For the first time, he isn't calculating the odds. He is accepting a bad deal because it is the right one.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Don't do it, Princess. Credits don't spend in Hell. Keep the gold."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Disappointing. I thought you were a rational creature, thief. Choose. The truth... or your friends."

### Scene 4: The Surrender

- **Key Event:** Angelica unbuckles the Cylinder case. She holds it up.
- **Key Event:** Vane smiles. He floats closer, extending his hand.
- **Key Event:** Angelica’s eyes lock with Ria, who is hiding in the wreckage of a vent shaft fifty meters away. It is a micro-signal.
- **Key Event:** Angelica drops the case. As it falls, she yells.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "JUMP!"
- **Key Event:** Ria fires. It isn't a kill shot (Vane's shields are too strong). It is an "Impact Round" meant to hit the gravity-disc.
- **Key Event:** The disc destabilizes. Vane stumbles, his concentration breaking. The "Gluttony" field flickers.
- **Key Event:** Angelica grabs Hatcher by his good arm. Zephyr grabs Lisbet.
- **Key Event:** They don't run for the stairs. They run for the edge.
- **Key Event:** The team throws themselves off the 100-story tower.
- **Key Event:** The air rushes past them, a roar that deafens the world. For a second, there is zero gravity. The stomach-lurching drop.
- **Key Event:** As they fall into the smoke and fire of the Undercity, Angelica looks back. She sees the roof receding. She sees Vane standing on the edge, screaming in silent rage.
- **Key Event:** The Cylinder case—which she strapped to a railing and rigged with a thermal grenade—detonates. It isn't a nuclear blast, but it is a bright, defiant flare of magnesium white. It engulfs Vane’s silhouette.
- **Key Event:** They plunge into the smog layer. The lights of the city blur into streaks of neon. It is terrifying, but it is also an escape. Vane cannot follow them here. This is the domain of the fallen.
- **Key Event:** The wind tears at their clothes. Hatcher passes out from the G-force and blood loss, his body going limp in the air. Angelica reaches out, grapples his belt, and activates her emergency thrusters.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She recognizes that falling isn't failing. It's just a different way of moving. Sometimes you have to go down to go forward.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "The truth didn't set them free. But maybe... maybe it gave them the weapons to free themselves. And now, we lead the charge from the bottom."
