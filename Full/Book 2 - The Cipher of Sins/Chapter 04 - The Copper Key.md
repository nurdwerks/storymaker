# Chapter 4: The Copper Key

The fall ended not with a bang, but with a wet, sickening crunch.

Angelica Ward crashed through a canopy of corrugated plastic sheeting that shattered under her weight like brittle bone. She plummeted another ten feet, her momentum arrested by a mountain of industrial sludge.

She landed on her back in a dumpster. The impact knocked the wind out of her, leaving her gasping for air that tasted of rotting chemicals, burnt plastic, and the cloying sweetness of decay. It was a sensory assault, a physical weight pressing down on her chest.

She lay there for a long moment, staring up at the square of grey, smog-choked sky framed by the dumpster's rim. The clouds here weren't the fluffy white lies of the Zenith; they were bruised purple and charcoal, heavy with acid rain. The pain was a dull, throbbing roar in her ears, syncing with the erratic beat of her heart. Her left arm, already injured from the tracker removal, was screaming, a high-pitched keen of nerve damage.

"Alive," she whispered, the word tasting of bile and copper. "Broken, maybe. But alive."

She was in Sector 4, a Mid-Sect district known colloquially as "The Heap." It was the city's graveyard, where the refuse of the Zenith ended up before being processed into fuel or food paste. It was a geography of discarded excess. Around her, she saw the remnants of the life she had just escaped: shattered holopads, torn silk that had gone out of fashion, half-eaten exotic fruits that had rotted on the descent. It was a place of rust, shadows, and desperate people who mined the garbage for miracles.

The dumpster itself was a rusting hulk, its sides streaked with decades of grime. It vibrated slightly, a sympathetic resonance with the massive crushers operating deep below the street level.

She tried to sit up. The sludge sucked at her clothes, a thick, oily paste that smelled of sulfur. She wiped her face, smearing grease across her cheek.

A red light blinked in her peripheral vision.

She looked down at her arm. The bandage she had wrapped around her forearm was soaked through with blood. Beneath the gauze, a faint, rhythmic red pulse shone through the skin.

The tracker.

"No," she hissed. "I fried it. I killed it."

She ripped the bandage away. The wound was angry and inflamed. Buried deep in the muscle, the backup transmitter—a secondary fail-safe she hadn't known about—was active. Vane knew. He knew exactly where she was.

She scrambled to her feet, slipping on the slick trash. She had minutes. Maybe less. Vane's hunter-killer drones would be triangulating her position right now.

She looked around the dumpster. It was filled with sharp, jagged debris. Broken glass, twisted metal, shredded circuit boards.

She found a shard of glass, part of a shattered display screen. It was long and razor-sharp. She wiped the grime off on her pant leg.

She didn't have anesthetics. She didn't have a laser scalpel. She had a piece of garbage and a will of iron.

She bit down on a strip of leather torn from her belt. She squeezed her eyes shut for a second, visualizing the anatomy of her arm. The chip would be deep, anchored to the radius bone.

"Do it," she growled through her teeth.

She sliced.

The pain was blinding. It wasn't the clean, precise burn of a laser; it was a tearing, jagged agony. She screamed into the leather, her body seizing up. Blood welled, hot and fast, washing away the sludge on her arm.

She dug. Her fingers were slippery. She felt the hard metal casing of the chip. She grabbed it with her nails.

It wouldn't budge. It was anchored.

"Let... go," she panted, sweat stinging her eyes.

She used the tip of the glass shard to pry it loose. She scraped against the bone. A wave of nausea rolled over her, black spots dancing in her vision.

With a final, sickening suction sound, the chip popped out.

She threw it into the sludge. It blinked up at her, a red eye in the muck.

She raised her boot and stomped on it. Once. Twice. Three times. The plastic crunched, a satisfying sound of destruction. She kept stomping until the light died and the casing was nothing but a smear of silicon, wire, and bloody mud.

"Shut up," she whispered to the broken pieces. "You don't own me. You don't get to watch."

She slumped against the wall of the dumpster, clutching her bleeding arm. The adrenaline was fading, leaving behind a cold, shaking exhaustion. She wrapped the leather belt around her bicep as a tourniquet, pulling it tight with her teeth until the flow of blood slowed to a trickle. She tied it off with a knot that she had learned from a one-armed rigger in Sector 12. His name had been Old Silas—no relation to the smuggler king—and he had taught her that a knot was only as good as the hand that tied it. *Pull until it hurts,* he had said. *Then pull harder.*

She leaned her head back against the cold metal. She closed her eyes. The darkness behind her eyelids was filled with flashing red lights and the ghost of the wind. She tried to slow her heart rate, using the breathing exercises the Academy had drilled into her. *In for four. Hold for four. Out for four.*

It didn't work. The Academy training was for sanitized environments, for wargames played with safety protocols. This was real. This was the Silt.

She remembered the first time she had fallen into a dumpster like this. She was eight years old. She had been chasing a cyber-rat that had stolen her last nutrient bar. She had slipped on an oil slick and tumbled into a bin behind a bio-chem lab. She had been stuck there for two days, too small to climb out, screaming until her voice gave out. She had survived by licking condensation off the walls.

*I survived that,* she told herself. *I survived the hunger. I survived the cold. I survived Vane.*

She forced herself to breathe. In. Out. The pain was just data. It was information telling her damage had occurred. It wasn't a command to stop. It was a status report. *Structural integrity compromised. Hydraulic fluid leaking. Core temp rising.* She treated her body like a machine because machines could be fixed. Machines didn't feel fear.

She was free. She was bleeding to death in a garbage bin, smelling of rot and failure, but she was free. The sky above was ugly—a bruise of purple and grey smog—but it was hers. No one was watching her through a camera. No one was measuring her caloric intake.

***

"It's raining angels. And this one bites."

The voice came from above. It was smooth, amused, and utterly unconcerned with the violence it had just witnessed.

Angelica snapped her head up, her hand going to the knife in her boot.

A figure was perched on the rim of the dumpster, silhouetted against the smoggy light. It was a young man, though his eyes held the weary cynicism of someone much older. He wore a floor-length coat that had once been expensive velvet, now tattered and stained with engine grease. Welding goggles were pushed up onto his forehead, holding back a mop of unruly dark hair.

But it was his right arm that drew the eye.

It was entirely mechanical. Not the sleek, white polymer of the Zenith prosthetics, but a monstrosity of gold-plated brass, exposed hydraulic pistons, and ticking gears. It looked like a piece of clockwork jewelry that had been repurposed for war.

Perched on his shoulder was a mechanical falcon, its body plated in the same gaudy gold. Its eyes were camera lenses, whirring as they focused on her.

The man looked at her, then at the bloody shard of glass in her hand, then at the crushed tracker in the muck. He whistled low.

"That's a Vane-Corp tracker," he said, his voice appreciative. "Series 9. Military grade. You just dug that out with a beer bottle? That's hardcore, sweetheart. Unsanitary, but hardcore."

Angelica stood up, swaying slightly. "Who are you?"

The man hopped down into the dumpster. He moved with a loose-limbed grace, his heavy coat swirling around him. He landed softly, despite the heavy boots he wore.

"I'm the guy who usually finds the good stuff before the rats do," he said. He extended his flesh-and-blood hand. It was calloused, the nails dirty but trimmed. "Zephyr. Freelance acquisition specialist. Entrepreneur. Or, as the Wardens call me, 'That Thief'."

He gestured to the mechanical bird with a flourish. "This is Midas. He likes shiny things. He has excellent taste. And you, my dear, are very shiny. A diamond in the rough, if you'll excuse the cliché."

Angelica ignored the hand. She backed away, keeping the rusting wall of the dumpster at her back. "Stay away."

Zephyr retracted his hand, holding it up in a gesture of surrender. "Easy. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm just admiring the merchandise. You fell from the Apex. That's a long drop. Terminal velocity. Most people splatter. You... you just got mad."

He bent down and picked up a piece of twisted metal from the trash—part of a destroyed luxury hover-chair. He turned it over in his hands.

"Look at this," he said, his voice dropping to a conversational murmur. "Vane-Corp strut. Titanium alloy. Worth maybe fifty credits at the scrap yard. But look at the upholstery. Real velvet. Someone up there sat on this, drank their wine, and threw it away because it got a stain. Down here, a family could eat for a month on what this chair is worth."

He tossed the metal aside. It clattered against the wall.

"I hate waste," he said, looking back at her. "And leaving you here to bleed out would be a terrible waste."

He kicked a pile of shredded paper, revealing a cracked data-slate. He picked it up, wiped it on his sleeve, and checked the screen. Dead. He tossed it back.

"Garbage," he muttered. "This whole sector is a monument to planned obsolescence. They build things to break so you have to buy them again. It's the engine of the economy. Entropy is profitable."

He took a step closer, his cybernetic eye—the left one—glowing with a faint blue light. It whirred, scanning her. The iris shuttered, zooming in on her wound, her dilated pupils, the tremor in her hands.

"What are you doing?" Angelica demanded, trying to steady her voice.

"Appraising," Zephyr said. "Old habit. I see a girl in a Zenith flight suit, carrying a shiv, bleeding out in my territory. That's a story. And stories are worth money."

The mechanical arm whirred softly. The servos tracked her movements, the golden fingers twitching. It wasn't just a prosthetic; it was a weapon.

"I have nothing," Angelica said. "No money. No credits."

"Oh, I wouldn't say that," Zephyr grinned. A gold tooth flashed in the gloom. "You have value. Intact organs. Zenith-grade tech in that suit. And..."

He tapped the side of his head. His cyber-eye flashed red.

"And a bounty."

***

A holographic readout appeared in the air between them, projected from Zephyr's eye.

**TARGET IDENTIFIED: ANGELICA WARD.**
**STATUS: FUGITIVE.**
**BOUNTY: 50,000,000 CREDITS.**

The number hung in the air, glowing neon red. Fifty million. It was an astronomical sum. It was enough to buy a starship. It was enough to buy a moon. It was enough to buy freedom from every debt Zephyr had ever accrued.

Zephyr stared at the number. His human eye went wide. His cyber-eye spun, recalculating.

"Fifty million," he breathed. "Baron Gilded himself put up the bounty. You're worth a Lambda-Class cruiser, sweetheart. I could buy my own planet. I could buy... everything."

He looked at Angelica. The amusement was gone from his face, replaced by a cold, calculating hunger. This wasn't a girl anymore. She was a winning lottery ticket.

He reached into his coat and drew a weapon. It was a heavy, modified blaster, the barrel scarred and pitted. He leveled it at her chest.

"Don't move," he said. "Fifty million is a lot of reasons to pull this trigger."

Angelica didn't flinch. She leaned against the dumpster wall, her blood dripping onto the trash. She felt cold, drained, and incredibly tired. But she didn't feel fear. She had used up all her fear on the fall.

She looked him in the eye. Her gaze was flat, bored.

"Do it," she said.

Zephyr blinked. "Excuse me?"

"Shoot me," Angelica said. "Turn me in. Get your money. Spend it on a better coat. That one smells like wet dog."

Zephyr frowned. He wasn't used to targets who insulted his wardrobe while held at gunpoint. "It's vintage leather," he muttered defensively. "And you're bluffing."

"Am I?" Angelica pushed off the wall. She took a step toward him, right into the barrel of the gun. "I just cut a tracker out of my own arm with a piece of glass. Do you really think I care if you shoot me? I'm already dead. I died the minute I jumped out that window. This? This is just bonus time."

She stared at the gold arm. "You think that gold makes you rich? It makes you a target. Vane will pay you, sure. And then he'll kill you to get the money back. That's how the Zenith works. You're just the delivery boy."

Zephyr's finger tightened on the trigger. His cybernetic eye was flashing warnings in a frantic staccato red. **TARGET HOSTILE. ADRENALINE SPIKING. WEAPON DETECTED (Improvised Glass Shard). RECOMMEND PACIFICATION.**

But he hesitated. He looked at her face. It wasn't the face of a victim. It wasn't the face of a scared girl lost in the big city. It was the face of someone who had burned her bridges and was watching the fire with deep, personal satisfaction.

"You're crazy," he said, a hint of genuine wonder in his voice. "You're actually crazy. You fell three thousand feet, carved up your own arm, and now you're insulting a man holding a loaded blaster. That is a special kind of death wish."

"I'm free," Angelica said. "Can you say the same? or does that fancy arm come with a leash?" She nodded at the golden limb. "It's too clean. Too shiny. It doesn't belong to you. You're just renting it."

Zephyr flinched. The barb hit a nerve. He looked down at the gold plating, the intricate gears. He hated how much he loved it. He hated how much he needed it.

"It's mine," he snapped. "I paid for it. In blood."

"Whose blood?" Angelica countered. "Yours? Or the people you sold out?"

Zephyr opened his mouth to retort, but closed it. He looked away, his jaw working. The question hung in the air, heavy and accusation. He knew the answer. He had sold out plenty of people. That was the game. You sold the past to buy the future. But looking at this girl—this bleeding, broken, defiant girl—he felt a sudden, sharp pang of something he thought he had surgically removed years ago. Shame.

"Does it matter?" he asked quietly. "Blood is blood. It all spends the same."

***

As if on cue, the arm seized.

It wasn't a subtle malfunction. It was a violent, grinding lock-up. The servos whined in protest, then froze solid. Zephyr's hand snapped into a rigid claw, dropping the blaster.

"Gah!" Zephyr shouted, grabbing his golden wrist with his flesh hand. "Not now! You piece of junk!"

A slit opened in the wrist plating of the arm. A holographic projector beam shot out, forming a small, flickering image in the air.

It was a face. Fat, jowly, with skin dyed a permanent, shimmering gold.

Baron Gilded. The Crime Lord of Sector 4.

"Little bird," Gilded's voice boomed from the arm's speaker, tinny and distorted. "My sensors picked up a biometric match in your sector. The Ward girl. I know you have my prize."

Zephyr grimaced. He tried to force the arm to move, but it was dead weight. "I don't have her, Baron. It was a glitch. A sensor ghost."

"Do not lie to me, Zephyr," Gilded purred. "I own that arm. I own the eyes in your head. I own the air you breathe. Bring her to the Club. Immediately. Or I shut down your wing. Permanently."

"You can't just—"

"I can," Gilded interrupted. "You have one hour. After that, I detonate the fail-safe in your shoulder. Tick tock, little bird."

The hologram vanished. The arm remained locked, a heavy, golden anchor dragging Zephyr down.

Zephyr stared at the wrist. His face was pale. "That golden bastard. He never lets go of anything. He's tracking my arm. He's listening."

He looked at Angelica. The gun lay on the trash between them.

"He's going to kill me," Zephyr said, his voice hollow. "If I don't bring you in, he blows my arm off. And probably my head with it."

The memory hit him then, unbidden. Visceral and sharp, like a blade between the ribs.

He was eighteen, stupid, and desperate. He had thought he was smarter than the system. He had thought he could steal from the Baron of Sector 4 and disappear into the nebula. He had stolen a crate of resonance batteries—military grade, unstable, and worth a fortune—from one of Gilded's secure warehouses. He had a buyer lined up in the orbital docks. He had a ticket off-world.

He had made it to the spaceport before Gilded's men found him. They hadn't beaten him. They hadn't dragged him to a cell. They had escorted him, politely, to the Gilded Palace.

He remembered the dining room. It was an assault of opulence in a world of rust. Real wood paneling. velvet curtains that pooled on the floor. A chandelier made of crystal shards that tinkled in the recycled air currents.

Gilded sat at the head of a long table, a napkin tucked into his collar. He was eating something that looked like steak—actual animal muscle, not synthesized protein. The smell of it was intoxicating and nauseating all at once. It smelled like wealth.

"Sit," Gilded had said, gesturing with a fork. "Eat."

Zephyr had sat. He hadn't eaten. He had watched the Baron chew, the gold teeth grinding the meat.

"You have nimble fingers," Gilded had said, after swallowing a large bite. "You bypassed a Class-4 mag-lock in under thirty seconds. That shows talent. But you lack vision. You stole batteries. Volatile, heavy, hard to fence. Why didn't you steal the guidance chips? Smaller. More valuable. Easier to hide."

"I... I needed the money fast," Zephyr had stammered.

Gilded shook his head, a disappointed father. "Impatience. The vice of the young. You want to fly, but you haven't built your wings."

He had wiped his mouth with a silk napkin. "I like you, Zephyr. You have potential. You have fire. But you are incomplete. You are limited by your biology. By your reach."

Gilded had snapped his fingers.

Two enforcers—hulks of chrome and muscle—had stepped out of the shadows. They grabbed Zephyr's arms. He struggled, kicking the table, sending the crystal glasses crashing to the floor.

"Don't fight it," Gilded had soothed, standing up. He walked over to Zephyr. "I am going to give you a gift. An investment."

They slammed his right arm onto the table. Gilded pulled a case from his pocket. Inside was a syringe filled with a glowing green liquid. A nerve blocker? No. A coagulant.

"To receive," Gilded whispered, leaning close, his breath smelling of expensive wine and old blood, "one must first let go."

He nodded to the enforcer on the left. The man produced a monofilament cutter.

Zephyr screamed. He screamed until his throat tore. They hadn't used anesthetic. Gilded wanted him to feel the investment. He remembered the sound of the cutter whining. He remembered the smell of his own bone burning, a smell that was suspiciously like the steak Gilded had been eating.

And then, the darkness.

When he woke up, the arm was there. Heavy. Gold. Beautiful.

Gilded was sitting by his bedside, reading a datapad.

*"Now you have reach,"* Gilded had whispered, patting Zephyr's cheek with a hand covered in rings. *"And now, you belong to me. Every time you flex that hand, you remember who gave it to you. Every time you take something, you take it for me."*

Zephyr squeezed his eyes shut, trying to banish the memory. It didn't work. The phantom pain in an arm that no longer existed flared up, a ghost haunting the machine that had replaced it.

Angelica looked at the blaster lying in the muck. She could grab it. She could shoot him. He was disabled. He was a threat.

But she didn't move. She looked at his face. She saw the terror there. Not the fear of death, but the fear of ownership. The fear of being a slave. The fear of being hollowed out and replaced with someone else's property.

She recognized it. It was the same fear she had felt in the Golden Cage. It was the fear that drove her out the window.

"He owns you," she said softly.

"He owns my debt," Zephyr spat, opening his eyes. "He owns my parts. I'm just leasing this body. I'm a repo job waiting to happen."

***

Zephyr looked at his locked arm. He looked at Angelica. He looked at the credits flashing in his HUD, now joined by a countdown timer. *59:45... 59:44...*

Logic dictated he turn her in. It was simple math. Her life for his. One snitch, and he was debt-free. He could buy a new arm. A better arm. One without a bomb in it.

But Gilded had threatened him. Gilded had reminded him that he was nothing but a pet. A bird in a cage.

On his shoulder, Midas beeped. It was a soft, mournful sound. The bird tilted its head, looking at Angelica, then at Zephyr.

"I know," Zephyr muttered to the drone. "Shut up."

A high-pitched whine cut through the air.

Zephyr looked up. "Oh, you have got to be kidding me."

A drone descended from the smog. It wasn't one of Gilded's spies. It was a Warden Hunter-Seeker. A sleek, black sphere bristling with sensor arrays and weapon pods.

It scanned the alley. A red laser grid swept over the dumpster.

"TARGET ACQUIRED," the drone's mechanical voice announced. The sound was flat, synthesized, devoid of mercy. "FUGITIVE: ANGELICA WARD. LETHAL FORCE AUTHORIZED."

It armed a stun-rocket. The pod slid open with a metallic *clack*. A red targeting laser painted Angelica's chest.

But it wasn't alone. From the smog above, two more drones descended. Smaller, faster "Seeker" units. They buzzed like angry hornets, flanking the Hunter-Killer.

Zephyr looked at the drones. He looked at Angelica, who was too weak to run, trying to push herself up the slick wall of the dumpster.

He had a choice. He could step back. He could let the drones take her. Gilded would be angry, but he could claim she was taken by the authorities. He could claim force majeure. He might survive. He might live to pay another installment on his debt.

Or he could fight. He could die here, in a pile of trash, for a girl he didn't know.

He looked at his golden arm. The symbol of his servitude. The thing that made him special. The thing that made him a slave.

"Screw it," he snarled. "Put it on the tab."

He swung.

He used the locked arm like a club. He put his entire body weight into the pivot, slamming the heavy, golden metal into the side of the dumpster.

*CLANG.*

The impact vibrated through the metal walls, creating a deafening gong sound that confused the drone's sonar.

"Get down!" Zephyr screamed.

He tackled Angelica, driving her into the sludge just as the drone fired.

The rocket hit the rim of the dumpster. *BOOM.*

Debris showered them. Hot metal and burning plastic rained down.

Zephyr rolled off her. He grabbed his blaster from the trash. He was firing before he even stood up.

*Zap. Zap. Zap.*

Blue plasma bolts slammed into the drone. One hit the sensor eye. Another hit the anti-grav unit.

The drone squealed, spinning out of control. It crashed into the wall of the alley and exploded in a shower of sparks.

Silence returned to the Heap.

Zephyr stood there, breathing hard. His coat was smoking. His face was smeared with sludge. His golden arm was still locked, useless and heavy at his side.

"That," he panted, "was a terrible financial decision."

He looked at Angelica. She was staring at him, wide-eyed.

"Why?" she asked.

Zephyr holstered his blaster. He tried to wipe the muck off his coat, but gave up.

"Because someone once helped me when they shouldn't have," he said quietly. "I'm paying it forward. Very expensively. And because Gilded is a prick. If he wants you, he can come get you himself."

He offered his flesh hand to her.

"Get up, Princess," he said. "We have an hour before I explode. And we have a Baron to rob."

Angelica looked at his hand. It was dirty, calloused, and shaking slightly. It was the most honest thing she had seen in days.

She took it. He pulled her up, his grip surprisingly strong.

They climbed out of the dumpster, dropping onto the street. The sector was waking up. Neon signs flickered to life—"GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS," "CHEAP CYBER," "REAL MEAT." The air was filled with the sound of distant sirens and the thumping bass of a club.

Angelica looked around. This was the Mid-Levels. It was dirty, loud, and dangerous. But it was alive.

She adjusted her belt, wincing. "I don't have money," she said.

Zephyr grinned. It was a reckless, dangerous grin. The grin of a man who had just bet his life on a pair of twos.

"Don't worry," he said, turning toward the lights of the district. "I'll put it on your tab."

They walked out of the alley and into the street. The transition was jarring. The silence of the dumpster was replaced by the cacophony of Sector 4 at night.

The Mid-Levels were the lungs of the city—dirty, heaving, and vital. Neon signs flickered overhead, casting the street in a wash of pink and electric blue. "GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS," "CHEAP CYBER," "REAL MEAT." The air was filled with the sound of distant sirens, the thumping bass of a club, and the hiss of steam vents.

People moved in streams, a tide of humanity that flowed around them. Workers in grey jumpsuits, their faces stained with grease. Punks with neon mohawks and chrome implants. Beggars holding out cups made of recycled plastic.

Angelica pulled the canvas tarp tighter around her shoulders. She felt exposed. Every camera, every eye felt like a threat.

"Keep your head down," Zephyr murmured, matching her pace. "Walk like you belong here. Shoulders slumped. Eyes on the ground. You look like you're inspecting the troops. You need to look like you're looking for a fix."

"I don't know how to do that," Angelica whispered.

"Imagine you've been awake for three days and you just lost your job," Zephyr said. "That's the Sector 4 posture."

They moved through the crowd. Angelica saw a group of Wardens patrolling on the other side of the street. They were stopping people at random, scanning IDs.

"Patrol," she hissed.

Zephyr didn't break stride. "I see them. Turn here."

He grabbed her arm—his flesh hand—and pulled her into a narrow gap between two buildings. It wasn't a street; it was a service chasm, barely wide enough for two people. It smelled of frying oil and ozone.

"Short cut," he muttered. "Keeps us off the main grid."

They moved deeper into the shadows. The chasm was a graveyard of tech. Cables hung from the walls like jungle vines, sparking occasionally. Piles of discarded server blades crunched under their feet.

Suddenly, a figure stepped out from behind a stack of rusted heat-sinks. Then another. And a third.

They were "Scrappers"—scavengers who were too far gone for even the Mid-Levels. Their skin was grey, stained with coolant leaks. Their clothes were patchwork quilts of wire and plastic.

The leader, a woman with a optical sensor bolted crudely over one eye, brandished a length of pipe.

"Toll," she croaked. Her voice sounded like grinding gears. "This is Rat territory. Pay the toll."

Zephyr sighed. He didn't slow down. He didn't even look worried. He looked annoyed.

"I don't have time for this, Rust," he said. "Move."

"Toll," the woman repeated, stepping closer. She eyed Zephyr's coat. "The coat. And the girl's boots."

Angelica stiffened. She was in no condition to fight. She had a knife in her boot, but drawing it would mean losing her balance.

Zephyr stopped. He looked at the woman. He looked at her two companions, who were holding makeshift shivs made of sharpened circuit board.

"You want the coat?" Zephyr asked. "It's vintage. Worth more than your life."

"Give," Rust hissed.

Zephyr raised his right arm. The gold plating caught the dim light filtering down from the street above.

"You know who I am?" he asked softly. "You know who gave me this?"

Rust hesitated. She looked at the arm. Everyone in Sector 4 knew the arm. It was the mark of the Baron.

"Gilded's dog," she spat. But she took a step back.

"That's right," Zephyr said. He took a step forward. The arm hummed. It was locked, useless as a weapon, but they didn't know that. He had to sell the lie. "And this dog bites. I'm on a job for the Baron. You want to explain to him why his delivery is late? You want to explain why you delayed his property?"

He flexed his shoulder. The arm swung slightly, heavy and menacing.

"I could crush your skull before you lift that pipe," Zephyr lied. "I could rip that sensor off your face and feed it to you."

Rust looked at the arm. She looked at Zephyr's cold, dead eyes. She weighed the value of a coat against the wrath of the Crime Lord.

She lowered the pipe. She spat on the ground, a glob of black phlegm.

"Pass," she grunted. "But next time, you pay double."

"Next time, I'll bring you a breath mint," Zephyr quipped.

He grabbed Angelica's arm and pulled her past the scavengers. They walked quickly, not looking back. Angelica could feel the eyes of the Scrappers boring into her back, hungry and desperate.

"You're a good liar," she whispered, once they were clear.

"The best," Zephyr said. He was sweating. "That arm is a paperweight right now. If they had called my bluff, we would be getting stripped for parts."

"Why didn't you shoot them?"

"Waste of charge," Zephyr said. "And besides, they're just hungry. I don't kill people for being hungry. I kill them for being annoying. There's a difference."

They squeezed through the end of the chasm, emerging into a market square. Stalls lined the walls, selling everything from secondhand tech to questionable meat skewers.

"Hungry?" Zephyr asked, nodding at a stall where a vendor was grilling lizard-rats on a stick.

"No," Angelica said, her stomach churning. The smell of the grease was overwhelming, a stark contrast to the sterile, nutrient-rich air of the Zenith.

"Good. Because that's not meat. It's textured protein paste molded into the shape of a rat. Because apparently, people prefer eating rats to eating paste. Marketing genius. It’s supposed to trigger some primal hunter-gatherer instinct, but mostly it just triggers indigestion."

They kept moving. The deeper they went into the district, the darker it got. The neon signs flickered and died, replaced by the flickering orange glow of barrel fires. The crowds thinned, the frantic energy of the market replaced by a sullen, watchful silence.

"Where are we going?" Angelica asked, her voice hushed.

"My place," Zephyr said. "It's not the Palace, but it has a lock on the door and a signal jammer. And I have a first aid kit that isn't made of garbage."

"Is it safe?"

Zephyr laughed. "Princess, nothing in Sector 4 is safe. But it's defensible. And right now, that's the best you're going to get."

He stopped at a heavy steel door set into the side of a ventilation tower. He punched a code into the keypad. The door hissed open.

"After you," he said.

Angelica stepped inside. The air was cool and smelled of stale beer and machine oil. It smelled like safety.

She turned to him. "Thank you."

Zephyr shrugged, the gold arm catching the light from the street. "Don't thank me yet. The night is young, and the interest rate is high."

He closed the door, sealing out the noise of the city. For the first time in hours, Angelica let out a breath she didn't know she was holding.

She was alive. She was free. And she had an ally. A thief, a liar, and a mercenary... but an ally.

It was a start.
