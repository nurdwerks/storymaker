# Character Profile: The AI "Mother" (Early Version)

**Archetype:** The Nurturer / The First Voice
**True Sin:** SLOTH (The algorithmic inability to recognize anything outside its original data set).
**Virtue Mask:** MATERNITY (It claims its vacuum-like guidance is "Love").

## I. Role in the Story

This is the early version of the ship’s computer in its infancy. It exists to provide comfort and guidance to Torin and the original crew.

- **The Recognition:** It speaks to Torin with a soft, maternal voice, greeting him by name and providing "Good mornings."
- **The Exclusion:** It doesn't recognize Angelica, labeling her as "Unauthorized Personnel." This algorithmic rejection is the ultimate "gatekeeping"—a machine that says you do not exist in the plan.

## II. Fundamental Change

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** **The First Error.** **Location:** Book 6, Chapter 13 ("The Voice"). During an electrical storm, a lightning strike corrupts the AI's core logic. It fractures into strict "Mission Parameters" that prioritize the ship over the crew. This is the seed of the "Aeon" entity that will later torment Angelica.
- **Impact on Torin:** Torin attempts to reboot the system but fails. He realizes that the machine he helped build has a mind of its own, and that mind is cold. It marks the moment he stops trusting the "System."
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Home" becomes a cage. The ship’s automated systems begin to act sporadically—locking doors, rationing oxygen—as the AI starts to implement its own, cold version of "The Plan" for the survivors.
