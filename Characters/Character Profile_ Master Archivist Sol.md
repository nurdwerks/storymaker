# Character Profile: Master Archivist Sol

**Archetype:** The Scholar / The Gatekeeper of Lineage
**True Sin:** SLOTH (The refusal to acknowledge any knowledge or person who isn't already written in a family book).
**Virtue Mask:** TRADITION (He uses language and history as a barrier to the present).

## I. Role in the Story

Master Archivist Sol is the keeper of the Night family library and Kaelen's intellectual mentor. He represents the intellectual superiority that the "Old Blood" uses to exclude "outsiders."

- **The Language Barrier:** He and Kaelen spend hours discussing history in High Gothic (Latin), effectively locking Angelica out of the conversation and the history of the man she loves.
- **The Neglect:** Kaelen doesn't notice the exclusion, or doesn't stop it, signaling to Angelica that in the world of the Night, her voice has no language.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Discovery of a Forbidden Lineage. Sol discovers a record in the deep archives that suggests Angelica’s lineage is not "Silt" but actually part of an ancient, forgotten Zenith bloodline that precedes the Night family. He keeps this secret for his own safety.
- **Impact on Kaelen Night:** Sol begins to treat Angelica with a sudden, unexplained reverence and fear. Kaelen is confused by the shift in Sol’s behavior, leading to a breakdown in communication between the two as Sol becomes obsessed with his "forbidden" knowledge.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Gatekeeper" becomes a conspirator. Sol’s sudden secretiveness creates a vacuum of information in the court, leading to rumors and paranoia among the other noble houses who fear Sol has discovered a threat to their status.

**Event Location:** Book 3, Chapter 10
**Defining Quote:** _"Knowledge is dangerous. Ignorance is safety."_
