## Chapter 13: Titans Stand

### Scene 1: The Breach

- **Key Event:** The battle on the hull escalates. The Shards have created a "Kill Zone" near the airlock, preventing the squad from retreating to safety.
- **Detailed Description:** The hull of the *Aeterna* is a chaotic landscape of twisted metal and silent explosions. The Shards, those two-dimensional razors of void, are swarming like angry hornets. They slice through the ship's communication arrays, sending towers of metal tumbling silently into space. Ria and her squad are pinned down behind a ridge of buckled armor plating. Their magnetic boots keep them anchored, but the vibrations of the impacts are shaking their bones. Every time a soldier pops up to fire, a Shard whips past, slicing the air where their head just was. The vacuum is filled with the debris of the fight—shards of ice, metal, and frozen blood.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria feels a cold rage building in her chest. She is used to being the hammer, not the nail. She hates being pinned down. She hates the feeling of helplessness. She looks at her squad—Knuckles, Stitch, Ghost. They are scared. They are looking to her for a way out. She realizes that standard tactics won't work. You can't flank a line that has no width. You have to break it.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She checks her ammo counter. It's low. She checks her suit integrity. It's compromised. She grins, a feral showing of teeth behind her faceplate. She taps her helmet, opening the squad channel.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Alright, you apes! They want to play rough? Let's show them what heavy metal looks like. Initiate Protocol: Sledgehammer."

### Scene 2: The Charge

- **Key Event:** Ria removes the safety limiters on Titan, her bonded construct. She prepares for a zero-gravity charge directly into the enemy line.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria stands up, abandoning cover. She screams a command word, and Titan manifests. The construct doesn't just overlay her; it encases her. Layers of heavy, spectral iron slam onto her frame, thickening her armor, expanding her silhouette until she looks like a walking tank. Her mag-boots lock onto the hull with a heavy *thud*. She raises her arm, which has transformed into a massive, hydraulic pile-bunker—a spike driver designed for deep-core mining.
- **Internal Conflict:** The physical toll is immediate. Ria's nerves scream as the bond interfaces with her nervous system, replacing her sense of touch with the cold, heavy sensation of being made of iron. She feels heavy, slow, and indestructible. The fear vanishes, replaced by the singularity of purpose. *Smash.*

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She charges. In zero-G, it is less of a run and more of a launch. She fires her thrusters, rocketing toward the line of Shards. She doesn't dodge. She intercepts.

- **Key Event:** Ria engages the Shards in melee combat.
- **Detailed Description:** A Shard slices toward her. Instead of evading, Ria catches it. Her Titan-enhanced hands, dense with magical mass, clamp onto the 2D plane. Sparks fly as the laws of physics scream in protest. She twists her torso, using the momentum of her charge to snap the Shard. It shatters like glass, dissolving into black dust. She doesn't stop. She crashes into the next one, driving her pile-bunker into its center. The explosive spike fires, shattering the entity. She is a whirlwind of violence, a blunt instrument in a surgical war.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria laughs, a harsh, metallic sound that echoes in her helmet. The simple act of smashing something restores her confidence. This is her world. This is physics she understands. Force equals mass times acceleration. And she has all the mass.

### Scene 3: The Support

- **Key Event:** Kaelen, recovered from his earlier psychic backlash, provides sniper support from the airlock.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen is kneeling in the open airlock door, tethered by a safety line. He is not using a rifle. He is using his hands. He mimics the motions of an archer drawing a bow. Shadows gather in his palm, condensing into long, thin spikes of darkness. He waits for Ria to shatter a Shard's formation, creating a gap. Then he fires. The Shadow-Spikes fly silent and true, piercing the cores of the distracted entities.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen watches Ria fight. He feels a grudging respect. He has always looked down on her as a brute, a thug from the Silt. But seeing her out there, holding the line against cosmic horrors with nothing but her fists and her rage, he realizes she is the only reason they are still alive. He pushes his own pain aside, focusing his mind, sharpening his shadows. He will not let her fall.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "On your left, Ria. Three degrees."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I see 'em! Keep them off my back, Leech, and I'll clear the path!"

- **Key Event:** The squad rallies behind Ria's charge.
- **Detailed Description:** Inspired by their leader, Squad Iron moves up. Knuckles lays down suppression fire with a heavy repeater. Ghost takes precise shots at the Shards' flanks. They move as a single unit, a machine made of meat and metal. They push the enemy back, yard by bloody yard, reclaiming the hull.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria feels a surge of pride. This is her family. This is her purpose. She isn't just fighting for survival; she is fighting for them. She slams her fists together, the sound ringing through the hull, challenging the void to send more.
