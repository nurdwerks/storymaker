**Archetype:** The Social Liaison / The Merchant Queen

**Virtue Mask:** MANNERS (She uses etiquette as a weapon of exclusion).

## I. Role in the Story

Lady Bullion is a merchant queen of the Mid-Levels who acts as Baron Gilded’s social liaison. She is draped in heavy furs and represents the exclusive club that Angelica can never join.

- **The Tactic:** She uses physical positioning and loud, performative laughter to mark her territory.
- **The Attitude:** She purposefully excludes Angelica from conversations, turning her back to form a closed circle with Gilded. This highlights Angelica’s outsider status and the fact that status in the Mid-Levels is bought, not earned.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 10: The Gala of Ghosts](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L838-854)
- **Defining Quote:** "Value is not intrinsic. Value is what a desperate man will pay to keep breathing. And tonight, the price of air is going up." (Reveals flaw: PRIDE)
