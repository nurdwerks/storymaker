## Chapter 12: The Library

### Scene 1: The Sanctuary / Historical Archives, Sector 7

- **Key Event:** The storm outside is deafening. Shards of ice the size of daggers hammer against the hull of the Spire. The temperature gauge on Dr. Aris's suit is flashing red: **-40°C**.
- **Key Event:** "Here!" Angelica shouts, prying open a rusted bulkhead door. "Get inside!"
- **Key Event:** They spill into the room, coughing. The air inside is stale, dry, and smells... sweet. Like vanilla and decay.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet shines her flashlight. The beam cuts through the dust motes and lands on rows and rows of shelves.
- **Key Event:** Books. real books. Not data-slates. Not crystals. Paper and ink. Tens of thousands of them.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet freezes. She walks forward, her hand trembling as she reaches out to touch a spine. "It smells like... old paper and dust. This is where they kept the thinking. Real thinking."
- **Key Event:** She pulls a book down. _The Republic_ by Plato. She doesn't know what it means, but she feels the weight of it.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Is overwhelmed by the physical books, having only ever seen digital data streams in the Spire.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "It smells like... old paper and dust. This is where they kept the thinking. Real thinking."

### Scene 2: The Choice / The Library

- **Key Event:** The cold creeps in under the door. The emergency heating unit flickers and dies.
- **Key Event:** "We're losing core heat," Hatcher says, checking the portable generator. "The battery is dead. We have maybe twenty minutes before hypothermia sets in."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks around. There is no wood. No plastic. Just metal shelves and... books.
- **Key Event:** "We need fuel," Aris says, his voice practical, cold. He points to the shelves. "Cellulose. Highly combustible."
- **Key Event:** Angelica stares at him. "You want to burn the library?"
- **Key Event:** "I want to not freeze to death," Aris counters.
- **Key Event:** Angelica walks to a shelf. She touches the spines. _Shakespeare. Austen. Orwell._ The history of the world they left behind.
- **Key Event:** "A thousand years of philosophy," she whispers. "Three hundred years of poetry. And we're going to turn it into ash for five degrees of heat."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Faces an ethical crisis over whether to burn history to survive the night.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "A thousand years of philosophy. Three hundred years of poetry. And we're going to turn it into ash for five degrees of heat."

### Scene 3: The Burn / The Library Center

- **Key Event:** Ria doesn't hesitate. She grabs an armful of books—encyclopedias, medical journals, novels. She dumps them into a metal trash can in the center of the room.
- **Key Event:** "Words don't keep the blood moving," Ria says, striking a flare. "Heat does. If you want to read, do it fast. The sun goes out in ten minutes."
- **Key Event:** She drops the flare. The dry paper catches instantly. Orange flames lick up the sides of the can.
- **Key Event:** The warmth is immediate and seductive. The group huddles closer, their shivering subsiding.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches the pages curl and blacken. She sees words disappearing. _Ideally... Justice... Love..._
- **Key Event:** She grabs a stack of books from the shelves near the medical section. She shoves them into her pack.
- **Key Event:** "Burn the fiction," she commands, her voice tight. "Burn the philosophy. But save the science. Burn the medical texts last. We might need the diagrams."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Views the books as "cellulose fuel," dismissing the sentimental value.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Words don't keep the blood moving. Heat does. If you want to read, do it fast. The sun goes out in ten minutes."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Burn the medical texts last. We might need the diagrams."

### Scene 4: The Revelation / The Firelight

- **Key Event:** Kaelen sits by the fire, feeding it slowly. He picks up a leather-bound journal. It's handwritten.
- **Key Event:** He opens it. The ink is faded, brown with age.
- **Key Event:** "Listen to this," he says. His voice is quiet, but it carries over the crackle of the fire.
- **Key Event:** "_Ship's Log. Year 102. Navigator Halloway. The stars... they aren't moving right. I checked the parallax. We aren't moving towards Alpha Centauri. We aren't moving at all. We're drifting._"
- **Key Event:** Kaelen looks up. The firelight dances in his eyes. "It says here the stars weren't getting closer. It says we were drifting. We were never heading home."
- **Key Event:** The silence in the room is heavy. Heavier than the cold.
- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris snatches the book from Kaelen's hands. He reads the page, his face pale. Then he tosses it into the fire.
- **Key Event:** "Ignore it," Aris snaps. "The Navigator was clearly suffering from oxygen deprivation. Space madness. Burn the page."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen watches the truth turn to ash. He doesn't say anything. But he knows. They all know.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It says here the stars weren't getting closer. It says we were drifting. We were never heading home."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Ignore it. The Navigator was clearly suffering from oxygen deprivation. Burn the page."
