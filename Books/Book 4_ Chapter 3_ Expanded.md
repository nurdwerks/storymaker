### Chapter 3: Dr. Aris

#### Scene 1: The Lab

The temperature in the Undercity was plunging with terrifying speed. Without the thermal regulation of the Zenith dome, the natural chill of the deep subterranean level was asserting itself. Frost was already forming on the twisted metal of the wreckage, glittering like diamonds in the light of the dying fires.

"We can't stay out here," Angelica said, her breath misting. "Kaelen is shivering so hard he's going to vibrate apart."

Kaelen, pale and huddled in his thin House Night coat, nodded weakly. The anemia caused by his blood magic made him particularly vulnerable to the cold.

They needed shelter. The residential blocks of Sector 4 were either crushed by the falling debris or burning. But amidst the wreckage, Angelica spotted something anomalous.

"There," she pointed.

Embedded in the side of a collapsed factory, crushing a row of slum tenements beneath its weight, was a sleek, white module. It didn't look like it belonged in the Undercity. It was a chunk of the Spire's Science Division—a laboratory pod that had been ejected during the collapse. Unlike the shattered palace, this module had fallen almost intact, its structural integrity fields holding it together like an eggshell. The windows were reinforced glass, unbroken, reflecting the chaos outside with a calm, sterile indifference. Soft blue emergency lights pulsed from inside, a heartbeat of civilization in the graveyard.

"A Science Module," Zephyr said, his teeth chattering. "That means generators. Heat. Maybe even coffee."

"And defenses," Ria added, unslaking her shotgun. "The Science Division didn't like visitors. Stay behind me."

They approached the airlock. It was sealed tight, the metal cold to the touch. Lisbet scuttled forward, her oversized goggles reflecting the keypad. Her fingers danced with static as she placed them on the control panel.

"Encryption is... complex," she muttered, her eyes darting as she read the code in her head via her neural link. "High-level Zenith biocodes. But the battery is leaking. I can jump it."

*Zap.* A spark arc from her fingertips, smelling of ozone. The door hissed, the hydraulic seals popping with a groan of pressurized air, and slid open.

#### Scene 2: The Scientist

Warmth rushed out to meet them, so intense it felt like a physical blow. It smelled sterile—antiseptic, ozone, and the faint, bitter scent of burnt coffee. They stepped inside, weapons raised, blinking against the clean white light.

The interior was a mess of overturned tables and smashed equipment. Glass beakers crunched under their boots. But the core systems were running. The hum of a fusion generator was the most beautiful sound Angelica had ever heard.

In the center of the room, illuminated by a ring of holographic displays, a man was working.

He didn't look like a survivor. He wore a pristine white lab coat, though it was stained with blue coolant and dark patches of dried blood. He was hunched over a microscope, his hands moving with frantic, jerky speed. He didn't even look up as the armed group stormed in.

"Don't touch the glass," the man said, his voice scratchy and distracted. "The condensation ruins the view."

Angelica lowered her weapon slightly. "Dr. Aris?"

She recognized him from the dossiers Vane had made her memorize during her training. Dr. Aris, the disgraced xenobiologist. The Sleepless Eye. The man who had been exiled for trying to play god with human DNA.

Aris turned slowly. His appearance was jarring. His eyes were wide, unblinking, the whites completely red with broken capillaries. The skin beneath them was bruised a deep purple. He had the look of a man who had been awake for a decade. He twitched, a micro-spasm in his neck that he ignored.

"Angelica Vance," he said, smiling a smile that didn't reach his eyes. It was a manic baring of teeth. "And the entourage. Welcome to the bottom of the barrel."

#### Scene 3: The Bond

Floating above Aris’s head was a nightmare.

It was **Nautilus**, his construct. A spectral, mechanical cephalopod, translucent and bioluminescent. It drifted through the air like it was underwater, its ten tentacles made of hard-light and circuitry. Each tentacle was typing on a different holographic screen floating around Aris.

The speed was impossible. Aris was processing data from ten different sources simultaneously. He was rewriting the module’s life support code, analyzing a blood sample, tracking the falling debris patterns, and seemingly playing a game of 4D chess all at once.

"You're awake," Zephyr whispered, horrified. "The legend says he never sleeps."

"Sleep is inefficient," Aris muttered, turning back to his work. "The brain requires downtime only to archive memory. I have bypassed the archive function. I process in real-time. Nautilus handles the defragmentation."

He tapped a key, and Nautilus mirrored the movement, its tentacles moving in a blur of light.

"Why are you here?" Ria demanded, stepping forward, her bulk filling the room. "This is our base now. Get out."

Aris laughed. It was a dry, hacking sound. "Your base? This module is the only thing maintaining atmospheric pressure in this sector. If I stop typing for thirty seconds, the scrubbers fail and we all asphyxiate on carbon dioxide. Or freeze. Take your pick."

He pointed a finger at the ceiling without looking. Nautilus extended a tentacle and adjusted a valve just as a warning light started to beep. The beeping stopped.

"See?" Aris said. "Mutual parasitism is the logical conclusion. I have heat. You have guns. I need bodyguards. You need oxygen."

#### Scene 4: The Bargain

Ria hesitated. She wanted to crush him. He represented the Zenith arrogance she hated—the intellectuals who broke the world from their ivory towers. But the warmth of the room was seductive. Her metal skin was already aching from the cold.

"We take the room," Ria said, negotiating. "You stay in the corner. If you try anything, I break your hands."

"Acceptable," Aris said, waving a hand dismissively. "But be warned. I am not alone."

He gestured to the heavy blast door at the back of the lab. It was dented from the inside.

Angelica stepped closer. "What kind of guests?"

Aris picked up a vial of black liquid from his desk. He swirled it. "The kind that don't knock."

He looked at them, his red eyes vibrating with intensity. "You are tired, aren't you? You want to sleep."

"We've been falling for hours," Angelica said, feeling the exhaustion deep in her bones.

"Sleep is a time-theft I cannot afford," Aris said, turning back to his screens. "But death? That is a permanent outage. If you want to avoid it, don't open that door."

He typed a final command, and the lights in the lab dimmed to a "rest mode" orange.

"Make yourselves comfortable," Aris whispered to his machines. "The experiment is just beginning."

Angelica looked at the blast door. She could hear something scratching on the other side. Not a rhythmic tapping, but a frantic, desperate clawing. It sounded like fingernails on steel.

"What's in there?" she asked.

Aris didn't answer. He was already lost in the data stream, his mind moving too fast for conversation. Nautilus floated above him, its unblinking electric eyes watching them with cold indifference.

Angelica sat down against the wall, pulling her knees to her chest. She checked her pulse. It was racing. She looked at Zephyr, who had already passed out from exhaustion.

They were warm. They were alive. But as she watched the Sleepless Doctor work, she knew they weren't safe. They were just rats caught in a new maze.
