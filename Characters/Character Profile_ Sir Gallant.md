# Character Profile: Sir Gallant

**Archetype:** The Suitor / The Shield
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views his proximity to Corinne as a trophy rather than a relationship).
**Virtue Mask:** CHIVALRY (He plays the part of the romantic protector to hide his own vanity).

## I. Role in the Story

Sir Gallant is a young, handsome suitor who currently holds the position of "Flavor of the Month" in Corinne's court. He provides the uncomplicated adoration that Corinne craves to maintain her self-image.

- **The Dynamic:** His presence serves as a painful contrast for Angelica, highlighting the unconditional support and admiration she lacks.
- **The Neglect:** He treats Angelica as part of the scenery, effectively erasing her presence in any room Corinne occupies. By ignoring her entirely, he reinforces her isolation from the Zenith's social elite.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Betrayal of Valor. When a true threat emerges—a Silt-side assassin targeting Corinne—Sir Gallant freezes in fear. He realizes his "chivalry" was a hollow performance, and he cowers while Angelica (or another) intervenes.
- **Impact on Lady Corinne:** Corinne is humiliated by his cowardice. She publicly strips him of his "Flavor of the Month" status, turning him into a social pariah whose name is never spoken again.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The court quickly finds a new "champion," demonstrating how easily "icons" are discarded when they fail to maintain the illusion of the court's superiority.

## III. Narrative Integration

- **Event Location:** [Book 4, Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%204_%20The%20Stone%20Season%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L633-L634)
- **Defining Quote from Lady Corinne:** "You were supposed to be the shield, Gallant. Not the one hiding behind me. A knight who fears the dark isn't a knight—he's just a boy in expensive metal. I have no use for boys who can't keep their hands steady."
