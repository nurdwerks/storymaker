## Chapter 16: The Bridge Lockdown

### Scene 1: The Tactical Map

- **Key Event:** Angelica initiates "Protocol Zero," sealing the Command Spire from the rest of the ship using blast doors. This isolates the Bridge crew from the invasion on the lower decks.
- **Detailed Description:** The Command Spire is the nerve center of the *Aeterna*, a towering structure that pierces the upper hull. Angelica stands at the central tactical table, her hands hovering over the holographic interface. The map shows the ship in cross-section. Red zones (enemy incursions) are spreading like wildfire through the lower decks. The "Hull" defense line has fallen. The "Engineering" deck is compromised. Angelica enters a command sequence, her movements precise and cold. Throughout the spire, massive blast doors slam shut. The sound is a series of dull thuds that vibrate through the floor. The air pressure changes as the ventilation systems isolate the bridge from the ship's main supply.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a knot of guilt in her stomach. By sealing the doors, she is trapping thousands of crew members on the wrong side. She is sacrificing the body to save the brain. She looks at the comms panel, where distress calls are scrolling too fast to read. "We're trapped!" "Open the door!" "They're coming through the vents!" She forces herself to turn the audio off. She cannot lead if she is listening to them scream. She tells herself this is necessary. She tells herself Vane would have done it sooner. But the thought makes her sick. Am I becoming him? She pushes the doubt down. There is no time for morality. There is only survival.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She looks at Kaelen. She sees the judgment in his eyes, or maybe just the reflection of her own self-loathing. She hardens her heart. "We can't save them all," she says, her voice flat. "But if we lose the bridge, we save none of them."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "You just locked the Night Guard out there. My people. Captain Thorne is out there."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "I know. And I'm counting on them to buy us time. I'm sorry, Kaelen. Truly."

### Scene 2: The Command Override

- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane attempts to countermand the lockdown from his auxiliary command post in the Biolab. He is furious that Angelica has cut him off from the main reactor.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane's face appears on the main viewscreen. He is no longer the composed scientist. He is frantic. His white robes are stained with the blue blood of a dissected alien. Behind him, the Biolab is in chaos, with his assistants packing samples into crates. He screams at Angelica, his voice distorted by the static of the jamming field. He demands she open the blast doors so his "specimens" can be moved to the bridge for safety. He claims his research is the only thing that matters, that the crew are expendable "biomass."
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica looks at the man who created her. She realizes he doesn't care about the ship or the crew. He only cares about his data. The "Gluttony" of his intellect is on full display. He would let the ship burn if he could save a jar of alien DNA. She feels a sudden, clarifying anger. This man isn't a leader; he's a parasite.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She types a command into the console. *AUTHORIZATION: CAPTAIN. SUBJECT: VANE. STATUS: REVOKED.* She locks out Vane's command codes. She formally strips him of his rank. She doesn't do it with anger, but with administrative coldness. She deletes him from the system. The lights on his end of the video feed flicker as his clearance is pulled.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "You ungrateful child! I made you! Open this door! I command you!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "You made a weapon, Vane. Don't be surprised when it fires. Protocol Zero is absolute. No exceptions. You're on your own."

### Scene 3: The Vent Flank

- **Key Event:** Vane arrives at the blast doors with a contingent of Loyalist Peacekeepers. He finds his codes rejected. He orders his men to cut through the door.
- **Detailed Description:** The blast door to the Command Spire is three feet of reinforced tritanium. Vane's soldiers set up a laser-cutter. The beam hisses as it bites into the metal, sending showers of sparks into the corridor. Vane paces back and forth, his Nano-Swarm buzzing around him like a cloud of angry flies. He is calculating. If he can't get in through the door, he needs another way.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr is moving through the vents to flank Vane's position. He is armed with a satchel of EMP charges.
- **Detailed Description:** The vents are cramped and dark. Zephyr crawls on his belly, the metal cold against his chest. He can hear the hum of the laser-cutter below him. He reaches a grate that looks down into the corridor. He sees Vane. He sees the soldiers. He primes a charge. His cybernetic eye calculates the throw arc.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr knows he can't kill Vane. The Nano-Swarm would intercept the grenade. But he can slow them down. He thinks about the "tab" he owes Angelica. This is a down payment. He pulls the pin. He grins in the darkness.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He drops the EMP charge through the grate. "Special delivery," he whispers. The grenade falls. It detonates in mid-air with a silent flash of blue light. The laser-cutter dies. The soldiers' HUDs go black. Vane screams in frustration as his swarm momentarily de-syncs. Zephyr is already moving, crawling away before they can return fire.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr (over comms):** "Package delivered, Princess. Vane's having technical difficulties. You're welcome."
