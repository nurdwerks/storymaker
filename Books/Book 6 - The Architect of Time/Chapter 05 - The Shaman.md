## Chapter 5: The Shaman

### Scene 1: The Visit / The Cage

- **Key Event:** Night falls. The jungle comes alive with nocturnal screams.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is trying to sleep sitting up.
- **Key Event:** A figure approaches the cage. Not the guard.
- **Key Event:** It is the man with the glasses. The Shaman.
- **Key Event:** He wears a vest made of untreated leather, but the pockets are filled with tools—bone wrenches, flint drills, coils of vine.
- **Key Event:** He squats by the bars.
- **Key Event:** He doesn't hold a spear. He holds a stick.
- **Key Event:** He pushes the stick through the bars and pokes her shoulder.
- **Key Event:** "Ow!" Angelica flinches. "Stop poking the merchandise!"
- **Key Event:** The Shaman nods. "Solid," he mutters. "Not a spirit."
- **Key Event:** He adjusts his glasses. The lenses are cloudy quartz, ground by hand.
- **Key Event:** "Optics," Angelica whispers. "Crude, but functional."
- **Key Event:** She realizes he isn't staring at her. He is studying her.
- **Key Event:** "Curiosity," she thinks. "My first ally."

### Scene 2: The Test / The Dirt

- **Key Event:** The Shaman clears a patch of dirt.
- **Key Event:** He draws a circle. Then a dot in the center. Then a smaller circle orbiting it.
- **Key Event:** He looks at her. Raising an eyebrow.
- **Key Event:** "Heliocentric model," Angelica realizes. "He's testing me."
- **Key Event:** She reaches through the bars. She smooths the dirt.
- **Key Event:** She draws a right-angled triangle.
- **Key Event:** On the sides, she draws squares. A^2 + B^2 = C^2.
- **Key Event:** The Shaman's eyes widen.
- **Key Event:** He grabs the stick. He draws a parabola. A trajectory.
- **Key Event:** Angelica adds the variable for wind resistance.
- **Key Event:** They work in silence. Drawing. Erasing. Modifying.

### Scene 3: The Connection / The Cage

- **Key Event:** For an hour, they don't speak a word. They speak Geometry. Physics. Calculus.
- **Key Event:** The dirt is covered in equations.
- **Key Event:** Angelica feels a lump in her throat.
- **Key Event:** Since the Fall, she has been surrounded by chaos. By noise.
- **Key Event:** This is order. This is truth.
- **Key Event:** "Universal constants," she whispers. "Gravity is the same here as it is in the Zenith."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the Shaman. He is smiling. A genuine, toothy smile.
- **Key Event:** He points to himself. "Torin."
- **Key Event:** Angelica points to herself. "Angelica."
- **Key Event:** "An-gel-ee-ka," Torin tests the syllables.
- **Key Event:** He nods. "Good math."

### Scene 4: The Name / The Cage

- **Key Event:** Torin stands up. He wipes his hands.
- **Key Event:** He looks at the guard, who is sleeping against a tree.
- **Key Event:** Then he looks back at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** There is no fear in his eyes. Only hunger. The hunger for knowledge.
- **Key Event:** "He isn't looking at the dirt," Angelica thinks. "He is looking at the math. He sees the code."
- **Key Event:** She realizes she has been wrong. They aren't just savages. They are potential.
- **Key Event:** "I'm not a demon to him," she whispers. "I'm a library. And he is the first person I've met who wants to read the book."
- **Key Event:** Torin reaches into his vest. He pulls out a piece of dried fruit.
- **Key Event:** He hands it to her.
- **Key Event:** "Eat," he says. "Brain needs fuel."
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes it. She bites into it. It is sweet.
- **Key Event:** "Thank you, Torin," she says.
- **Key Event:** "Tomorrow," Torin says, pointing to the dirt. "More math."
- **Key Event:** "Ideally," Angelica agrees. "But maybe bring a key next time?"
