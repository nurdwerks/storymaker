# Chapter 23: The Standoff

The summit of the Spire was no longer a platform. It was an arena.

The wind, which had been a howling constant during their climb, seemed to hold its breath. The only sound was the humming of the broadcast array and the distant, rhythmic thrum of Headmaster Vane's shuttle hovering silently in the clouds above.

On the black obsidian disc, Squad Iron was at war with itself.

It started with a twitch.

Kaelen Night didn't move like a human being. He moved like a glitch in the simulation. One moment he was standing ten feet away, his silhouette sharp against the blinding white sun; the next, he was a blur of negative space, closing the distance with terrifying velocity.

He leaped.

He didn't jump; he launched himself, his body twisting mid-air like a corkscrew. His dual shadow-blades—weapons that were more focused darkness than metal—hissed as they cut through the thin air. He aimed a downward slash at Ria's shoulder, a strike designed to disable the hydraulic actuator that powered her massive Titan arm.

Ria didn't dodge.

Ria was a mountain. Mountains didn't dodge avalanches; they endured them.

She raised her left arm. The Titan-Plate gauntlet, a masterpiece of Artificer engineering that weighed more than Angelica did, caught the blade.

_CLANG-ZZZT!_

The sound was deafening, a shriek of metal on metal that vibrated in Angelica's teeth.

Sparks, white-hot and blinding, sprayed across the platform.

Ria's boots scraped backward across the obsidian, carving deep white gouges in the black stone. She grunted, the muscles in her neck cording with effort. Her arm glowed a dull cherry-red as the kinetic dampeners absorbed the impact. The impact registered a 7.2 on her internal stress gauges, well within tolerance, but enough to make her teeth ache.

"You're slow, Night!" she roared. "You're hesitating!"

She twisted her wrist, locking the shadow-blade in a vice grip between her armoured fingers. She squeezed. The metal groaned, protesting the immense pressure. She could feel the blade's strange, ethereal energy trying to slip through her grip, but the gauntlet's magnetic field held it fast.

"Hesitation implies doubt," Kaelen retorted. His voice was calm, almost bored, a stark contrast to the violence of his motion. "I am merely calibrating."

He released the handle of the trapped blade.

It dissolved into black smoke instantly.

Ria stumbled back, the sudden release of resistance throwing her off balance. Her internal gyros whined, struggling to compensate for the unexpected shift.

Kaelen dropped to a crouch, his remaining blade held in a reverse grip. "Your center of gravity is too high. Your footwork is plodding. You rely on armor to absorb mistakes."

"Shut up and fight!" Ria screamed. She charged.

She didn't use technique. She used mass. She became a battering ram, shoulder lowered, thrusters firing to accelerate her thousand-pound frame to forty miles per hour.

Kaelen didn't meet the charge. He flowed around it.

He stepped to the left, a movement so subtle it barely registered. As Ria thundered past, he tapped her hip joint with the hilt of his sword. Just a tap.

It was enough.

At that speed, even a minor deviation was catastrophic. Ria's trajectory shifted. She missed Kaelen by inches and slammed into a decorative obsidian pillar near the edge of the platform.

_CRASH._

The pillar exploded. Stone shrapnel rained down.

Ria skidded to a halt, turning around with a roar of frustration.

"Stop dancing!"

"Stop flailing," Kaelen countered. "You are fighting like a brawler in a tavern. This is a duel of executioners."

He raised his hand. The smoke from his dissolved blade reformed, solidifying back into cold steel.

"Shadow Art: Dispersion."

He split.

It wasn't a hologram. It was kinetic displacement. One Kaelen became three. Three became five.

Five Kaelens stood in a circle around the giantess. They were identical—black fatigues, pale skin, cold violet eyes. They raised their swords in unison.

"Pick a card," they said in stereo.

Ria spun around, her eyes darting between them. Her targeting computer was screaming _ERROR. MULTIPLE CONTACTS. UNABLE TO LOCK._

"Coward!" she yelled.

She slammed her massive palms together.

_BOOM._

A sonic shockwave rippled out from her hands. It hit the clones. Four of them vanished instantly, dissipating into wisps of black vapor.

But the fifth one—the real one—was nowhere to be seen.

Ria blinked. "What?"

"Above you," a voice whispered.

She looked up.

Kaelen was descending from the sky, drifting down like a leaf in the wind. He had used the updraft from her shockwave to gain altitude.

He fell towards her, his blade pointed straight down.

He landed on her shoulders.

It was a feat of balance that defied logic. He perched on her armor plating, light as a bird.

"Get off!" Ria shrieked, reaching up to grab him.

Kaelen flipped backward, pushing off her helmet. As he did, he drove his heel into the delicate sensor cluster at the base of her neck.

_CRUNCH._

The optics in Ria's helmet went static. Blinded, she swung wild, punching the air.

Kaelen landed softly ten feet away.

"Your situational awareness is lacking," he observed. "You focus on the X and Y axis. You forget the Z."

Ria tore her helmet off. It clattered to the ground, sparking. Her face was red, sweaty, and furious.

"I don't need sensors to crush you," she growled. "I can smell your fear."

"I have no fear," Kaelen stated. "Only optimal pathing algorithms."

He lunged again.

This time, he went low. He slid across the obsidian, aiming for the knee joint he had identified earlier.

Ria saw it coming. She lifted her leg and stomped down, trying to crush him.

Kaelen rolled. The massive boot slammed into the stone where his chest had been a microsecond ago.

He popped up behind her. He slashed his blade across the back of her knee.

_SCREECH._

The mono-blade bit into the joint, severing hydraulics and control wires. Fluid spewed out, hissing as it hit the hot stone.

Ria's leg buckled. The servo whined in death-throes, and the massive limb locked up, refusing to respond. She crashed onto one knee, the impact shaking the entire platform.

"Damn you!" she screamed. She swung a backhand, a blow that would have decapitated a normal man, a blow that could have shattered a lesser mech.

Kaelen ducked under it. He rolled away, coming up in a ready stance ten feet back, his eyes never leaving her.

"Yield," he said. "The outcome is mathematically certain. Your mass is a disadvantage in this environment. You are fighting gravity as much as you are fighting me."

"I don't yield!" Ria snarled. "I break!"

She stood up. The servo in her leg shrieked, but she forced it to move, overriding the damage protocols with sheer willpower.

Steam began to vent from the ports on her shoulders. White plumes hissed into the freezing air, carrying the scent of ozone and heated metal.

"Oh no," Angelica whispered. She was huddled near the edge of the platform, watching the nightmare unfold. "Don't do it, Ria."

Ria did it.

She activated Overload.

Her skin, already flushed from exertion, turned a deep, burning crimson. Veins stood out on her forehead like ropes. Her eyes lost their irises, flooded with blood until they were pools of solid red rage.

"PROTOCOL: BERSERKER," she screamed. Her voice was distorted, layered with a metallic echo that grated against the bone.

Pain exploded in her nervous system. It wasn't the dull ache of exhaustion; it was the searing, white-hot agony of her own blood boiling. The alchemical stimulants in her armor's injectors flooded her veins, overriding her safety limiters. Her heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped bird, beating so fast it was just a continuous flutter.

Her skin, already flushed from exertion, turned a deep, burning crimson. Veins stood out on her forehead like ropes, pulsing with dark, oxygen-rich blood. Her eyes lost their irises, flooded with hemorrhage until they were pools of solid red rage.

She was no longer Ria. She was a vehicle for violence.

"Run, little man," she gurgled.

She didn't charge this time. She jumped.

She launched herself into the air, a thousand pounds of angry metal and flesh defying physics. The obsidian beneath her boots pulverized into dust at the launch. She rose into the air, blotting out the sun, a red-and-black meteor of hate.

She brought both fists down in a hammer blow that was aimed not at Kaelen, but at the platform itself.

Kaelen's eyes widened. For the first time, the calculation faltered. "Insanity."

He leaped backward, activating the emergency burst-thrusters in his boots.

Ria hit the ground.

_CRACK-BOOM!_

The obsidian shattered.

It wasn't a crack; it was a geological event. A spiderweb of fractures exploded outward from her fists, racing across the platform faster than the eye could follow. The sound was like the earth itself screaming in pain. Shards of razor-sharp stone the size of cars were thrown into the air like shrapnel. The shockwave lifted the entire section of the platform, tilting it at a crazy forty-five-degree angle.

Kaelen was mid-air. He twisted, dodging a flying boulder that would have crushed him into paste. He pushed off a piece of floating debris, using it as a stepping stone to launch himself higher, his movements fluid and desperate.

But Angelica...

Angelica wasn't a ninja. She wasn't a tank. She was just a girl standing in the wrong place.

The shockwave hit her like a physical hand.

It lifted her off her feet—literally threw her into the air. The world spun. Sky. Stone. Cloud. Sky.

She hit the ground hard, sliding across the smooth glass. Friction burned through her tunic. She scrambled, her fingernails scratching uselessly against the polished surface, trying to find purchase, trying to find friction.

There was none.

She saw the edge coming.

Blue sky. White clouds. And a three-thousand-foot drop.

"No!" she gasped.

Her boots went over the edge. Her legs followed. Gravity grabbed her waist and pulled.

She slammed her hands down, grabbing the lip of the platform.

She stopped.

She hung there, her fingers white-knuckled on the smooth stone, her body dangling over the abyss. The wind grabbed at her legs, swinging them like a pendulum. She dared to look down.

The clouds swirled below, dizzying and distant. They looked soft, like a bed. But she knew they were just water vapor covering the hard, unforgiving streets of the Lower City. If she fell, she wouldn't even leave a mark. She would just be a wet spot on the pavement.

"Help!" she screamed.

Her voice was lost in the noise of the battle.

Ria was roaring, a primal sound that tore at her own throat. She was tearing chunks of rock from the ground—slabs weighing tons—and hurling them at Kaelen. Kaelen was a ghost, weaving through the destruction, closing in for the kill, his blade flashing like lightning in the dust.

They didn't hear her. Or they didn't care.

Angelica pulled herself up. Her muscles screamed. Her shoulders popped. She scrambled, kicking her legs, until she managed to hook her elbow over the edge. She hauled herself back onto the solid ground, lying flat, panting, shaking.

She looked up.

The fight had stopped.

It was a stalemate.

Ria had backed Kaelen against the base of the massive broadcast antenna. She had him pinned. Her massive fist was raised, ready to bring it down and crush his skull like a grape.

But Kaelen... Kaelen had his blade pressed against the soft, unarmored seal of her neck joint. The tip of the mono-blade was actually dimpling the skin. A single droplet of blood ran down the steel.

They were frozen. A tableau of violence carved in silence.

One move from Ria, and she crushes him. One twitch from Kaelen, and he severs her jugular.

They stood there, chests heaving, eyes locked in mutual hatred.

"Do it," Ria hissed. Her voice was wet, bubbling with saliva. "Cut me. I dare you."

"Crush me," Kaelen whispered. "See if you're fast enough to kill me before your brain dies from lack of blood."

Angelica stared at them.

These were her friends.

They were the people she had shared rations with. The people who had pulled her out of the poison gas in the caverns. The people who had laughed with her over bad coffee in the mess hall.

And now, because a hologram in the sky told them to, they were going to kill each other.

Something inside her snapped.

It wasn't fear this time. It wasn't the cold, calculating logic of the mechanic.

It was rage.

It was a white-hot, blinding fury that started in her gut and flooded her veins like liquid fire. It burned away the doubt. It burned away the hesitation. It burned away the "Runt" and left something else entirely.

She stood up.

She wiped the blood from her nose with the back of her hand. She spat a mouthful of copper-tasting saliva onto the black stone.

She walked toward them.

She didn't run. She didn't sneak. She stomped. Her boots rang on the obsidian, a steady, rhythmic drumbeat in the sudden silence.

She opened her mouth to scream.

But she didn't just use her throat. She reached down, deep into that well of power she had touched in the library, that frightening, limitless reserve of Resonance she had tried to hide. It felt like grabbing a live wire. It felt like swallowing a star.

She didn't ask it. She didn't coax it. She commanded it.

**"STOP!"**

It wasn't a word. It was a weapon.

A wave of pure, transparent force exploded from her. It rushed outward in a visible ripple, distorting the air like a heat haze. The sound was not a sound; it was a pressure wave that hit the eardrums like a hammer.

It hit the ground, cracking the stone further.

It hit the hovering camera drone that had been circling for a close-up. The machine disintegrated instantly, turning into a cloud of sparkling dust and twisted metal components.

It hit Kaelen and Ria.

It blasted them apart.

Ria was thrown backward as if she had been hit by a wrecking ball. She tumbled end over end, crashing into a pile of debris, her armor groaning under the impact.

Kaelen was lifted off his feet and slammed against the base of the antenna. He slid down the wall, gasping for breath, his sword clattering to the floor.

The scream ended. The echo rolled across the platform, bouncing off the spire, drowning out the wind.

Silence fell. A heavy, ringing silence.

Angelica stood in the center of the devastation. Her body was vibrating. It wasn't shivering; it was resonance. Every cell in her body felt like it was humming at a frequency that was just slightly out of phase with reality.

She looked at her hands. They were glowing. Veins of white light traced the pathways of her nervous system, fading slowly as the excess energy grounded itself into the air. The smell of ozone and burnt sugar hung thick around her.

Her uniform was torn. Her hair was wild, standing up with static charge. Her eyes were glowing—not red like Ria's, not violet like Kaelen's, but a brilliant, terrifying white.

She looked like a giant. Not in size, but in presence. For a moment, she wasn't just Angelica Ward, the Runt of Squad Iron. She was an event. She was a natural disaster wrapped in skin.

The power receded, leaving a hollow ache in her chest, like she had just screamed until her lungs collapsed. But the anger remained. The anger was the fuel.

Kaelen looked up at her, his eyes wide with shock. He wiped blood from his mouth. His face was pale, his usual composure shattered.

"Kinetic... Voice..." he wheezed. "Impossible. That is a Level 5 ability."

Ria groaned, pushing a slab of rock off her chest. She sat up, shaking her head to clear the ringing in her ears. She looked at the Runt. The Runt who was currently vibrating with enough power to level a city block.

"Angie?" she whispered. "What... what are you?"

Angelica didn't answer. She walked to the center of the platform. Her steps were heavy, weighted with purpose.

She reached into her belt. She pulled out her pistol. It was a heavy, kinetic slug-thrower she had looted from a guard in Level 4. A primitive weapon, but effective.

She checked the chamber. Loaded.

She looked up at Vane's shuttle. She stared directly into the camera lens mounted on the nose, daring him to look away.

"You want a show?" she screamed at the sky. "I'll give you a show!"

She raised the gun.

Kaelen started to move, struggling to his feet. "Ward, don't shoot him! The shields will deflect it! You cannot penetrate a Class-B force field with a slug-thrower!"

"I'm not shooting him," Angelica said.

She turned the gun.

She pressed the barrel against her own temple.

The metal was cold against her sweating skin. The sensation grounded her. This was real. This was the variable she could control. Her finger tightened on the trigger.

Everyone froze.

Kaelen stopped mid-step. Ria scrambled to her feet, her hands held out, forgetting her own pain. Vane's hologram flickered, leaning forward in surprise, the giant face showing a flicker of genuine confusion.

"Angelica, no!" Ria shouted. "Put the gun down!"

"Ward," Kaelen said, his voice trembling for the first time. "This is illlogical. The probability of survival is zero if you execute that action. Put the weapon away."

"Illogical?" Angelica laughed. It was a jagged, hysterical sound. "You want to talk about logic, Night? Let's talk about variables. Vane set up an equation. Three variables. Two slots. One remainder."

She pressed the gun harder against her head.

"You want to reduce the variables? Fine. let's simplify the equation. I'll do it. I'll resign."

"Angelica, please," Ria begged, tears cutting tracks through the dust on her face. "Don't do this. We can find another way."

"What way?" Angelica snapped. "There is no other way! Not in his game!"

She gestured with her free hand at the two of them.

"I'm your friend, you absolute morons! I'm the one who pulled you out of the poison! I'm the one who calibrated your armor, Ria! I'm the one who kept you from becoming monsters!"

Her voice cracked.

"Do you remember the soup?" she asked, her voice dropping to a whisper that somehow carried over the wind.

Ria blinked, confusion warring with the panic in her eyes. "What?"

"The soup," Angelica said, tears finally spilling over. "Cycle 4. We had been in the mud for three days. No rations. We found that tin of expired synth-broth."

She looked at Kaelen.

"You calculated that it wasn't enough calories to sustain three combat operatives. You said logic dictated one person should eat it to maintain peak efficiency. You tried to give it to Ria."

She looked at Ria.

"And you... you big idiot. You tried to give it to me. You said I was too small to starve."

A memory washed over them. The cold barracks. The single heating coil. The three of them sitting in a circle, passing a dented tin cup back and forth, each taking a tiny sip, refusing to take more than their share. It was a pathetic meal. It tasted like rust and salt. But it was the best meal Angelica had ever eaten.

"We split it," Angelica said softly. "Three ways. Exact to the milliliter. Because that's what a squad does. We share the hunger. We share the cold."

She pressed the gun harder against her temple.

"And now you want to hoard the survival? You want to take the seats and leave me the check? I don't think so."

"And this is how it ends?" she shouted, the anger returning. "With you tearing each other apart for Vane's amusement? For a seat on a bus?"

She looked up at the hologram.

"Is this what you wanted, Headmaster?" she yelled. "Are the ratings high enough yet? Are they entertained?"

Vane's voice boomed down, magnified by the speakers.

"Candidate Ward. Suicide is a disqualifying action. It demonstrates a lack of resolve."

"Lack of resolve?" Angelica spat. "It takes a hell of a lot more resolve to pull this trigger than it does to stab a friend in the back."

She looked back at Kaelen.

"You said logic dictates the strongest survive. Well, I'm changing the logic. If I die, the equation is solved. You two take the seats. You win. Congratulations."

"No," Kaelen whispered. He dropped his sword. It clattered on the stone. "No. That is not a victory. That is a failure."

"The math doesn't work, Angie," Ria sobbed. "3 minus 2 equals 1. Only two seats."

"Screw the math!" Angelica screamed. "We change the equation! We don't play his game anymore!"

She lowered the gun slowly. She didn't holster it. She held it at her side.

She turned to face the massive Spire behind them.

It rose like a needle, piercing the sky. The surface was covered in arrays, dishes, and glowing lines of circuitry.

"Look at it," she said.

Kaelen looked. "What? The antenna?"

"It's not just an antenna," Angelica said, her mechanic's eye dissecting the structure. "It's the primary broadcast node for the entire Zenith network. It's pushing this feed to every screen, every speaker, every comm-bead in the colony."

She turned back to them. A savage smile spread across her face. It wasn't a nice smile. It was the smile of someone who had just realized that the game board wasn't made of wood; it was made of tinder, and she was holding a match.

"It's a microphone."

She looked at her shoulder.

Aeon, who had been hiding in the folds of her hood during the fight, poked his head out. He ruffled his golden feathers, sensing the change in the air. He looked at the antenna, then at Angelica. He chirped, a sound that cut through the wind.

_Query: Integration?_

_Response: Aggressive,_ Angelica thought back.

"Yes," she whispered aloud. "We aren't just going to broadcast. We're going to scream."

She looked at Kaelen. "I want to hijack it. I want to connect Aeon to the array. I want to override the carrier signal and replace the Selection feed with our own. I want to tell the whole damn colony that the Selection is rigged. I want to show them the blood on your hands, and the madness in Ria's eyes. I want to show them the truth."

Kaelen stared at her. He looked at the antenna, tracing the lines of power. He looked at the shuttle hovering above, knowing that every second they wasted was a second closer to a plasma purge.

"That is insanity," he said, but there was a flicker of something in his eyes. Respect? "The feedback could fry your brain. The encryption is military-grade. House Night security protocols. It uses a rolling 256-bit cypher that changes every ten seconds."

"Can you crack it?" Angelica asked.

Kaelen hesitated. He looked at Vane's hologram. For the first time, he saw the Headmaster not as a god, but as an enemy. He saw the strings.

"The protocols possess a backdoor," he murmured. "My father built them. He always builds a backdoor. I know the key."

"But the power requirement," he added, his mind catching up to hers. "The array needs a massive surge to override the lockout. We need gigawatts, not megawatts."

Ria stepped forward. She wiped her eyes. She looked at her fist, still glowing with residual energy from the Overload. The metal was cooling, but the core was still active.

"Power?" she grunted. She flexed her gauntlet. The servos whined, a sound like a jet engine starting up. "I can do power. I can punch that connector so hard it'll think it was hit by lightning. I've got a full charge in the capacitors."

Angelica looked at them.

The tension on the platform had shifted. The murderous intent had evaporated, replaced by something much more dangerous.

Rebellion.

"Better than dying on this rock," Angelica said. "Better than killing you."

Kaelen sheathed his shadow-blades. He straightened his uniform, smoothing the creases. Then, he did something unexpected.

He walked over to Ria.

The giantess watched him warily, her fists still clenched.

Kaelen held out a hand. It was a small, pale hand compared to her armored gauntlet.

"The variable has changed," Kaelen said. "We are no longer competitors. We are co-conspirators. Protocol dictates a synchronization of objectives."

Ria looked at the hand. Then she looked at his face. She grinned, a bloody, terrifying expression that showed all her teeth.

"You talk too much, Night," she grunted.

She reached out and clasped his forearm in the warrior's grip. It was a mismatch of scale—her metal fingers completely enveloped his arm—but the grip was firm.

"But you fight okay," she added. "For a skinny guy."

"And you," Kaelen replied, not flinching as her grip threatened to crush his radius, "are an adequate blunt instrument."

"Let's break some stuff," Angelica said, stepping between them. She put a hand on both their shoulders. "Group hug later. Treason now."

"We have two minutes before Vane realizes what we're doing," Kaelen noted, checking his wrist chrono. "Let's make some noise."

**Imperial Palace - The Viewing Chamber**

The Emperor leaned forward on his throne. The golden tubes hissing in his chest worked overtime, pumping adrenaline into his ancient veins.

On the massive screen, the three candidates had stopped fighting. They were huddled around the base of the antenna.

The Emperor's mechanical eye whirred, zooming in.

"Interesting," he rasped. "The Silt-rat is attempting to rewrite the rules mid-game. Either she is a fool, or she understands power better than most nobles."

A shadow moved beside him. Lord Cromwell stood there, his ledger forgotten in his hand.

"They are accessing the primary junction," Cromwell noted, his voice devoid of its usual dryness. "That is... unexpected. Shall I order Vane to terminate the candidates, Majesty? A strafing run would be efficient."

The Emperor held up a withered hand.

"No," he said. "Let it play out."

"But Majesty, if they breach the broadcast encryption..."

"Then they deserve to be heard," The Emperor said. A smile touched his lips, cracking the ancient, parchment-like skin. "I want to see if she can actually do it. I want to see if a rat can shout down a god."

He leaned back, the throne sensing his shift in posture and adjusting the flow of stimulants.

"Do you know why I allow the Selection to continue, Cromwell?" he asked softly.

Cromwell hesitated. "To filter the population, Majesty. To identify the strong."

"That is Vane's answer. That is the bureaucratic answer."

The Emperor pointed a claw-like finger at the screen, at the tiny, defiant figure connecting wires to the antenna.

"I allow it because entropy is the enemy of empire. Order breeds stagnation. Stagnation breeds rot. We sit in our cloud cities, floating above the filth, convinced of our own superiority. But down there... in the Silt... life is a crucible."

He zoomed the image in further, until Angelica's face filled the wall. He studied the smudge of grease on her cheek, the fierce determination in her white eyes.

"The Silt creates things we cannot manufacture in the Zenith. It creates hunger. It creates a desperate, clawing need to survive that no Highborn academy can teach."

"She is a chaotic element," Cromwell argued. "Chaos is dangerous."

"Chaos is energy!" The Emperor snapped. "And my Empire is running out of batteries."

He watched Kaelen Night typing on the datapad.

"Look at the boy," The Emperor said. "House Night. bred for loyalty. Bred for stealth. He is a perfect tool. But tools do not innovate. Tools do not change the game."

He looked at Ria.

"The Titan. House Iron. Bred for strength. A hammer. But hammers only know how to hit nails."

He looked back at Angelica.

"But the Girl... she is not a tool. She is an operator. She is the one holding the handle. She looked at a rigged game, a mathematical impossibility, and she didn't fold. She didn't flip the table. She rewired the rules."

He tapped his chin.

"That is what I need, Cromwell. I don't need more soldiers. I have legions. I don't need more assassins. I have shadows."

"I need an Architect," he whispered. "I need someone who can see the machine, understand it, and isn't afraid to break it to make it better."

"She is threatening to delegitimize the entire Selection process," Cromwell pointed out, though his tone suggested he was playing devil's advocate. "If she speaks to the colony... if she exposes the lie..."

"Then the lie was too weak to survive," The Emperor stated. "Let it burn. Truth is a fire, Cromwell. It cleanses."

He watched the progress bar on Kaelen's datapad.

_Encryption Bypass: 98%_

"Let her speak," The Emperor commanded. "Override Vane's jamming protocols. Give her the frequency."

Cromwell's eyes widened. "Majesty?"

"You heard me. Open the channel. I want the whole world to hear what a Silt-rat has to say."

Cromwell bowed low. A ghost of a smile touched his own lips.

"As you command, Your Radiance."

He tapped a sequence into his personal datapad.

"Channel 1 open. Interlock disengaged. The floor is hers."

**Highborn Quarter - The Gilded Cage**

In a private viewing box suspended above the Opera House, Lady Corinne sat on a velvet chaise lounge. She held a pair of pearl-inlaid opera glasses to her eyes, watching the feed.

She saw Angelica connecting wires. She saw Kaelen typing frantically on a datapad. She saw Ria bracing herself against the structure.

She lowered the glasses.

Her face, usually a mask of bored perfection, was pale.

"She's not playing the game," Corinne whispered to herself.

She took a sip of wine. Her hand was shaking slightly.

"This changes everything. The girl is either about to die spectacularly... or become the most dangerous piece on the board."

She looked at the screen again.

"Scream, little rat," she murmured. "Scream for all of us."

---

**The Summit**

"Connection ready!" Angelica yelled over the wind. She had ripped open a panel on the antenna base, exposing thick bundles of fiber-optic cables. Aeon was clamped onto the main trunk line, his beak sunk into the data-stream, his feathers glowing with blinding golden light.

"Encryption bypass at 90%!" Kaelen shouted, his fingers flying across his datapad. "I need the surge! Now!"

Kaelen wasn't just typing. He was fighting a war in a digital battlespace.

His HUD was a blizzard of code. Red walls of firewalls rose up to block him; he slashed them down with logic bombs and brute-force decryption algorithms his father had taught him before he could walk. It was a dance as deadly as the one he had just fought with his swords. One wrong keystroke, one missed syntax error, and the counter-measures would fry his neural cortex.

_Access Denied. Access Denied. Access Denied._

The system fought back. He could feel the heat building in his datapad. The Zenith AI was adapting, rewriting its own defensive lattice to box him in. It was like fighting a hydra; cut off one head, and two more constraints appeared.

"Come on," he hissed, sweat dripping onto the screen. "You are just a machine. I am Night. I am the shadow in the code."

He saw it. A fluctuation in the carrier wave. A tiny, deprecated port in the legacy code, left there by the original architect—his grandfather. It was a vulnerability the size of a pinhole, hidden beneath layers of bureaucratic bloat.

He drove a virtual wedge into it and hammered.

_Access Granted._

"I'm in the root!" he yelled. "But the transmission buffer is dead! It needs a jumpstart! The capacitors are dry!"

Ria roared.

She wound up. Her arm whined, the servos screaming as she pushed them past the red line.

"EAT THIS!"

She punched the power coupling.

_CRACK-ZZZTT!_

A bolt of blue electricity arc, thick as a tree trunk, exploded from the impact point. It raced up the antenna, leaping from spar to spar giving the Spire a halo of lightning. The smell of ozone was overpowering.

"Now!" Kaelen yelled. "Broadcast initiated! Uploading stream!"

Angelica grabbed Aeon. She felt the surge hit him. She felt it hit her.

It wasn't pain. It was connection.

But it wasn't a clean connection. It wasn't like plugging a datapad into a terminal. It was like plugging her brain into a hurricane.

_CRACK-HISS-WOOSH._

Reality dissolved.

Suddenly, she wasn't on the platform anymore. She wasn't standing on obsidian. She was floating in a sea of static. White noise roared in her ears, a cacophony of a million voices speaking at once.

_...buy low sell high..._
_...rations cut again..._
_...did you see the Match?..._
_...Emperor save us..._
_...hungry..._

The data wasn't just visual; it was tactile. She could feel the stock market ticker scratching against her skin like sandpaper. She could taste the soapy propaganda of the news feeds. She could smell the fear radiating from the Lower City comm-beads.

Aeon shrieked in her mind—not a bird sound, but a pure, digital tone that acted as a stabilizing anchor. He was the filter. He was the prism that took this blinding white light of information and focused it into a laser.

_Query: Vector?_

_Response: Omni-directional,_ Angelica screamed back mentally. _Burn it all down._

The static cleared. The noise coalesced into a signal.

She felt her consciousness expanding, stretching out across the physical infrastructure of the Spire. She was racing down fiber-optic cables at the speed of light. She was jumping across wireless relays. She was vibrating in the speaker cones of every television set in the colony.

She saw them all. Millions of faces. The tired, the hungry, the bored, the angry.

She felt their collective breath held in anticipation.

She opened her mouth.

And she spoke to the world.
