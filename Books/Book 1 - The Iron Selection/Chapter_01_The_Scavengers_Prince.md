## Chapter 1: The Scavenger's Prince

### Scene 1: The Descent

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward descends into Sector 12 ("The Undercity") via a grease-slicked cable at Node 42, where pneumatic trash tubes from the Zenith deposit refuse.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Demonstrates her philosophy of "quality control" rather than scavenging, viewing Zenith's discards as puzzles rather than trash.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Look at you. Too pretty for the drop? Did you scratch the paint? Is that why they flushed you?"

- **Key Event:** Angelica discovers a smashed Medical Drone (Model 7-Alpha) in the canister and straps the 40-pound unit to her back.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Shows cold, calcified contempt for the wasteful Zenith elite.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You better be worth the calories."

### Scene 2: The Workshop

- **Key Event:** Angelica repairs the drone in her hidden workshop (a repurposed ventilation hub) using her self-made "spectacles" and soldering skills.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Takes pride in her repair work, believing she understands machines better than Zenith engineers who only "push buttons."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Wakey wakey."

- **Key Event:** The drone powers up and hovers, scanning the room and requesting return to Sector 1 Medical Bay.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Sweetheart, you're about three miles and two tax brackets away from Sector 1. You belong to House Ward now."

### Scene 3: The Reality Check

- **Key Event:** Angelica hears her brother Leo Ward (age 10) coughing from his cot—a wet, fluid-filled sound indicating severe illness.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her confident "Prince" persona vanishes, replaced by the terrified sister.

- **Key Event:** The drone scans Leo and diagnoses Acute Particulate Fibrosis ("Under-Lung"), requiring Grade-A Steroid Inhaler and Cellular Scrubbers unavailable in the dispensary.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo Ward:** "Angie?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Better. I found a doctor."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo Ward:** "It's okay, Angie. I'm not hungry anyway."

### Scene 4: The Decision

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes the drone cannot save Leo—it can only diagnose. She makes the decision to hack into the Medical Grid to steal real medicine.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her pride curdles into anger at the injustice of the Zenith hoarding medicine while children die below.

- **Key Event:** Angelica threatens the drone with a hyper-spanner to unlock its Medical Grid access codes.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "My authorization is that I have a screwdriver and you have an off switch. Unlock."

- **Key Event:** Angelica says goodbye to Leo, promising to get him real medicine, and departs to hunt rather than scavenge.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I promise. I will buy the sky for you, Leo."

### Scene 5: The Quote

- **Key Event:** Angelica climbs toward the mid-levels with the drone following her, ignoring its warning about trespassing.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Articulates her worldview that fixing things proves they're broken, and declares the entire city broken.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I don't fix things to make them work, metal-head. I fix things to prove they're broken. And this whole city? It's broken."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let's go void the warranty."
