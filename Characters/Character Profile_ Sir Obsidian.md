# Character Profile: Sir Obsidian

**Archetype:** The Champion / The Shadow
**True Sin:** WRATH (His silence is not peace, but a reservoir of potential violence).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (His absolute, unthinking obedience is his only virtue).

## I. Role in the Story

Sir Obsidian is Vesper’s silent champion, a knight clad in suits of black glass armor. He does not speak, acting instead as a looming physical threat to anyone who challenges the Glass Queen.

- **The Presence:** He stands behind Vesper, hand always on his sword, ready to silence any dissent.
- **The Message:** If Angelica raises her voice, he steps forward. His silent threat and total devotion to Vesper highlight Angelica’s lack of protection and the lethality of the Zenith’s social games.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 23: The Slaughter](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1821-1828)
- **Defining Quote:** "Revealing he had been nothing but a hollow construct all along." (Reveals flaw: WRATH/EMPTINESS)
