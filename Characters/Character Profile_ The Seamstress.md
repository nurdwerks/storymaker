# Character Profile: The Seamstress

## I. Role in the Story

The Seamstress is a woman who creates the intricate, often painful garments and ceremonial armor for the Night family. She views the body as a canvas for the family's glory.

- **The Viewpoint:** She looks at Angelica with clinical detachedness, discussing how to "hide the Silt-birth" through draped fabrics.
- **The Pain:** She represents the physical cost of being a Night—the idea that beauty and status require suffering, a concept Angelica is forced to confront when she is "fitted" for her role.

## II. Book 3 Integration: The Broken Canvas

- **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 13 (Nightfall).
- **The Scene:** Scene 3: The Broken Canvas.
- **The Event:** During the seizure of the estate, The Seamstress tries to stop the guards from entering the wardrobe. She pleads to finish a hem on a silk dress.
- **The Fate:** A guard crushes her hands with a mace. "No further production authorized."
- **Status:** **Maimed / Useless.** Her hands, the source of her value and the Night's visual glory, are destroyed. She is kicked aside like trash.
