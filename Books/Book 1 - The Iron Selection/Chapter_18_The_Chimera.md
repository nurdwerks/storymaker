## Chapter 18: The Chimera

### Scene 2: The Merge

- **Key Event:** Ria calls on her bonded beast: "TITAN!" A spectral Silverback Gorilla overlaps her body. Her skin hardens to gunmetal grey, she grows six inches, and rips off the Chimera's hydraulic tail.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Reveals her Titan-Form transformation for the first time.

- **Key Event:** The Chimera adapts, tackling Ria and pinning her with a rotary saw heading for her throat.

---

### Scene 3: The Pin

- **Key Event:** Ria's force-field flickers. The saw is inches from her neck. Angelica's pipe throw bounces off uselessly. Kaelen's blades glance off mesh armor.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Ria!"

---

### Scene 4: The Chrono-Slip

- **Key Event:** Angelica commands Aeon to "eat the last ten seconds." A white vortex opens in his beak.

- **Key Event:** Time reverses. Ria un-falls. The Chimera un-lunges. They reset to ten seconds earlier.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Aeon** — Demonstrates temporal manipulation ability for the first time.

- **Key Event:** Angelica (with bleeding nose and splitting headache) screams "RIA! ROLL LEFT!" before the beast moves. Ria trusts her, rolls, the Chimera hits the wall, and Kaelen stabs the exposed gap.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "RIA! ROLL LEFT!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Did we win? I swear it jumped me."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "It did. You just got a do-over."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen notes "Temporal manipulation. Dangerous." Angelica counters "Effective."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I didn't predict the future. I just remembered it."
