## Chapter 36: The Door

### Scene 1: The Move

- **Key Event:** The Setting.
- **Detailed Description:** The core chamber of the Time Engine is destabilizing. The temporal dampeners have failed completely. Arcs of temporal lightning—purple and white energy that erases matter from existence rather than burning it—are striking the floor plates with the sound of cracking thunder. The air is pressurized and ionized, tasting of copper.
- **Key Event:** The Tactic.
- **Detailed Description:** **Torin**, the Architect, stands at the central console. He knows the variables. He knows that **Angelica Ward** will never leave him willingly. She is stubborn, loyal, and brave—traits he loves, but traits that will get her surely killed in this moment. He feigns a moment of weakness, stumbling against the console, clutching his chest.
- **Key Event:** The Reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica instinctively steps forward to support him, offering her shoulder, lowering her guard.
- **Key Event:** The Shove.
- **Detailed Description:** As soon as she is within range, he moves. He grabs her by the harness of her suit. With a surge of desperate strength amplified by his exo-frame, he spins her around and shoves her backward through the open airlock door. The movement is violent, born of absolute necessity. Angelica stumbles back, tripping over the raised threshold, landing hard on her back on the grating of the bridge corridor. Her breath leaves her in a rush.
- **Key Event:** The Lock.
- **Detailed Description:** Before she can scramble to her feet, Torin hits the "Seal" button on the interior panel. He slams his fist onto the red button.
- **Key Event:** The Regret.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin hates himself for being rough with her. He sees the shock in her eyes as she falls. He wants to apologize, to explain, but he knows that a gentle goodbye would turn into a debate, and a debate would kill them both. He chooses her survival over her forgiveness.

### Scene 2: The Glass

- **Key Event:** The Seal.
- **Detailed Description:** The heavy blast door slams shut with a hydraulic hiss, engaging the magnetic locks with a definitive, mechanical _thunk_. The red "LOCKED" light spins above the frame.
- **Key Event:** The Panic.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica throws herself at the door. She pounds on the thick, reinforced porthole glass with her fists until her knuckles bruise inside her gloves. She screams his name, but the sound is cut off by the vacuum seal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Don't you dare! Torin! Open this door! We can find another way! The math can change! Open it!"
- **Key Event:** The Separation.
- **Detailed Description:** Inside the chamber, the light is shifting from white to a deep, bruising purple as time begins to fold in on itself. Torin stands on the other side, bathed in the red glow of the emergency lights. He looks small against the backdrop of the spinning machine, a lone figure facing the end of time.
- **Key Event:** The Attempt.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica claws at the exterior control panel. She tries to hotwire the override. But the panel sparks and dies under her fingers. Torin has fused the mechanism from the inside. She is trapped in safety. She realizes he planned this.
- **Key Event:** The Acceptance.
- **Detailed Description:** She stops screaming. She presses her forehead against the cold glass, feeling the vibration of the engine rattling her teeth. She realizes this is his choice. It is a calculated sacrifice, the only variable that solves the equation. She respects him enough to stop fighting, even though it breaks her heart.

### Scene 3: The Goodbye

- **Key Event:** The Environment.
- **Detailed Description:** The roar of the Time Engine is now so loud it vibrates the floor plates under Angelica's feet. Inside the chamber, gravity is failing. Debris—tools, data chits, loose screws—floats in the air, caught in local eddies of zero-G.
- **Key Event:** The Connection.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin floats slightly off the floor, anchored by his magnetic boots. He walks—or drifts—back to the console. He doesn't look at the explosion building behind him. He looks only at Angelica. He places his gloved hand on the glass, matching hers.
- **Key Event:** The Erasure.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin feels the dissolution of his own timeline. His memories are starting to fade, replaced by the white noise of the paradox. He forgets his childhood. He forgets the color of the sky on his homeworld. He forgets his own name. But he holds onto one image: her face. That is the constant.
- **Key Event:** The Message.
- **Detailed Description:** He mouths the words, knowing the comms are down. He pours all his remaining self into that silent message. His eyes are clear, focused, and full of love.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin (Mouthed):** "I love you. Now go. Fly. Save them."

### Scene 4: The Overload

- **Key Event:** The Turn.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns away. He cannot watch her leave. He has to finish the work.
- **Key Event:** The Lever.
- **Detailed Description:** He grips the brass lever with both hands. It is vibrating violently. The metal is hot enough to burn through his thermal gloves. He smells burning leather.
- **Key Event:** The Pull.
- **Detailed Description:** He pulls it down. The resistance is immense, like pushing against the tide of history itself. He puts his back into it. The lever slams into the "Overload" position.
- **Key Event:** The Scream.
- **Detailed Description:** The machine shrieks. A wave of temporal distortion washes over him. For a split second, his mind expands. He sees all possible futures. He sees the _Aeterna_ escaping. He sees a city growing. He sees Angelica, old and gray, teaching children about the man who saved time.
- **Key Event:** The End.
- **Detailed Description:** That vision is enough. He vanishes in a flash of blinding white light that leaves a permanent silhouette burned onto the chaos of the room. The chamber is consumed. Matter ceases to exist.

### Scene 5: The Run

- **Key Event:** The Collapse.
- **Detailed Description:** The blast door begins to buckle inward. The heat is radiating through the metal, blistering the paint on the walls. The containment field is collapsing.
- **Key Event:** The Choice.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands there for one heartbeat too long. She wants to stay. But she remembers his order. _Fly._
- **Key Event:** The Run.
- **Detailed Description:** She turns and runs. She sprints down the corridor, her boots pounding on the grating. Tears stream down her face, blinding her, but she knows the ship by heart.
- **Key Event:** The Promise.
- **Detailed Description:** She doesn't look back. She runs for the escape pod, carrying his sacrifice in her heart and his database in her pocket.
- **Key Event:** The Hollow.
- **Detailed Description:** She feels a deep, cold hollow in her chest. She is alive, but she feels like she died in that room. She promises herself she will make it worth it. She will build the future he died for.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica (Whispering):** "I'm flying, Torin. I'm flying."
