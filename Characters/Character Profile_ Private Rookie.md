# Character Profile: Private "Rookie"

**Archetype:** The Student / The Innocence of War
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for glory, for battle, and for Ria's maternal approval).
**Virtue Mask:** ADMIRATION (His fear of Angelica is his shield against the unknown).

## I. Role in the Story

Private "Rookie" is a young soldier Ria is mentoring. He represents the next generation of the Vanguard, being shaped by Ria's "Iron" philosophy.

- **The Fear:** He is terrified of Angelica, viewing her as a "goddess of war" or a monster. He hides behind Ria when she approaches.
- **The Sting:** Ria ruffles his hair—a simple, warm gesture of affection she never gives to Angelica. This kindness toward the "Rookie" makes Angelica's own isolation feel even more profound.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Violent Loss of Innocence / Death. **Location: Book 4, Chapter 11 (The Fight).** During a raid on a cannibal camp, Rookie hesitates to shoot a child attacker. The hesitation costs him his life. He dies in Ria's arms, hardening her resolve.
  **Quote:** _"I couldn't... he was just a kid."_
- **Impact on Ria:** Ria is devastated. She blames herself for "allowing" a boy like Rookie into the Vanguard. Her leadership becomes colder and more focused on survival at any cost, as she tries to ensure no one else dies because of "softness."
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Moral Compass" is gone. The unit's lightheartedness dies with him. The remaining members become more cynical and ruthless, losing the last bit of humanity that Rookie’s presence provided to the squad.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Key Event | **Rookie**, a young soldier from Ironwood's guard who joined them, hesitates. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Detailed Description | Rookie raises his weapon at a small figure charging him. It is a child, no older than ten, but with the same filed teeth and dead eyes as the adults. Rookie freezes. He sees a kid. The kid sees meat. The child lunges, driving a shiv into Rookie's throat. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | *Internal Conflict | Rookie dies with a look of confusion on his face. He held onto his humanity for one second too long, and it killed him. Ria sees this. She screams, not in grief, but in rage. She shoots the child without hesitation. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **Rookie (gurgling):** "I couldn't... he was just a kid..." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Detailed Description | Distracted by Rookie's fall, Ria is flanked. The leader of the Cannibals, a massive man wearing armor made of street signs, swings a heavy pipe. It connects with Ria's side, crushing armor and bone. She goes down, gasping. She rolls, firing her pistol into the leader's stomach until he stops twitching. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Detailed Description | The ambush breaks. The Cannibals retreat, dragging their dead (and Rookie's body) with them. They leave the survivors bleeding in the dark. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | *Internal Conflict | Angelica looks at her group. They are harder now. Colder. Rookie is dead because he hesitated. The child is dead because he wasn't useful. They are shedding their humanity to stay light enough to outrun death. She wonders what will be left of them when they reach the surface. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "We remember them. Rookie. Leo. We carry them with us." |
