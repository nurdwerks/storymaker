## Chapter 27: The Fuel

### Scene 1: The Problem / The _Aeterna_ Engineering Deck

- **Key Event:** The engine is beautiful. A chrome ring utilizing exotic matter containment.
- **Key Event:** Angelica runs her hand over the cold metal. "It's perfect," she says.
- **Key Event:** "It is," Torin agrees. "But it's empty."
- **Key Event:** He taps the fuel gauge. **0%.**
- **Key Event:** "We need antimatter," Angelica says. "Or high-yield ionic plasma. We don't have the infrastructure to refine it. The village forge barely melts steel."
- **Key Event:** She kicks the bulkhead. "It's a Ferrari with no gas. A paperweight."
- **Key Event:** She paces the deck. "I have a time machine. I have a warship. And I'm grounded because I can't fill the tank."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's a Ferrari with no gas."

### Scene 2: The Solution / Engineering Deck

- **Key Event:** Torin looks at his map of the valley.
- **Key Event:** "The mountain," he says. "Mount Silas. The elders say it shakes sometimes. Restless earth."
- **Key Event:** Angelica stops pacing. She looks at the seismic data on the wall.
- **Key Event:** "It's a volcano," she says. "Active magma chamber. Geothermal pressure."
- **Key Event:** Her eyes light up. The predator look.
- **Key Event:** "If we can tap the mantle," she says, talking fast. "If we can funnel that heat into a particle accelerator... we can crate a pinch-field. We can _make_ antimatter. Or at least enough resonance-plasma to jump-start the core."
- **Key Event:** "Tap a volcano?" Torin asks.
- **Key Event:** "We turn the planet into a battery," Angelica says.

### Scene 3: The Plan / The Village Forge

- **Key Event:** The next day, the village is a hive of activity.
- **Key Event:** They are melting everything. Gold jewelry. Copper wiring scavenged from the crash. Ceramic plates.
- **Key Event:** "We need a cable," Angelica directs. "A superconducting conduit. Three miles long. Thick as a tree trunk."
- **Key Event:** Torin operates the press. Sweat pours off him. "And then?"
- **Key Event:** "Then we drop it down the throat of the volcano," Angelica says.
- **Key Event:** The villagers look terrified but determined. They trust her.
- **Key Event:** "We need to plug into the planet," Angelica shouts over the roar of the fire. "We are going to give the world a transfusion. From its heart to our ship."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need to plug into the planet. We are going to give the world a transfusion."

### Scene 4: The Risk / The Volcano Rim

- **Key Event:** They stand at the edge of the crater. The heat is unbearable. Sulphur chokes the air.
- **Key Event:** The cable is ready. A massive, gleaming snake of metal coiled on a winch.
- **Key Event:** "If we miss the vein," Torin says, shouting over the rumble, "it won't work."
- **Key Event:** "And if we hit a pressure pocket," Angelica yells back, "we blow the top off the mountain. The village—and the ship—will be buried in ash."
- **Key Event:** Torin looks at her. "So, 50/50?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica grins. It's a terrifying grin.
- **Key Event:** "Better odds than I usually get," she says.
- **Key Event:** She puts her hand on the release lever.
- **Key Event:** "If we don't do this, the Hunters find us. We die here. Let's do it."
- **Key Event:** She pulls the lever.
- **Key Event:** The cable plunges into the lava.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If we tap it wrong, we blow the top off the mountain. ... But if we don't, we die here. Let's do it."
