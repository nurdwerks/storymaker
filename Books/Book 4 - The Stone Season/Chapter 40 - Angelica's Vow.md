### Scene 2: The Silence / The Undercity

- **Key Event:** For a moment, nothing happens.
- **Key Event:** Then, a deep, resonant _THRUM_ vibrates through the deck plates. It starts low, in the soles of their feet, and rises until it rattles their teeth.
- **Key Event:** The emergency lights flicker and die. Total darkness.
- **Key Event:** Then, the main lights ignite. Sector by sector. Level by level. A wave of illumination washing away centuries of gloom.
- **Key Event:** The air vents cycle. Fresh, clean oxygen floods the room.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches the holographic map. Green lights are turning on everywhere.
- **Key Event:** "We’re awake," she says, tears in her eyes. "The whole ship... it’s breathing again."

### Scene 3: The Regroup / Observation Deck

- **Key Event:** They take the turbo-lift up. It moves smoothly now, gliding on magnetic rails.
- **Key Event:** They step out onto the Observation Deck. The blast shutters are retracting.
- **Key Event:** The nebula is gone. The haze is gone.
- **Key Event:** Outside, space is clear. The stars are diamonds on velvet.
- **Key Event:** The survivors gather. They are dirty, bandaged, exhausted. But they are alive.
- **Key Event:** Lady Corinne steps forward. She isn't wearing silks. She is wearing scavenged mechanics' overalls.
- **Key Event:** She opens her hand. In her palm are wrinkled, brown pellets.
- **Key Event:** "Soil-Seeds," she says. "From the hydroponics bay. I saved them."
- **Key Event:** She hands them to Angelica. "We need a garden. Not a palace. A garden."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr laughs, holding up his hook. "I’ll handle the irrigation. Turns out a hook is great for digging."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "We need a garden. Not a palace. A garden."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I’ll handle the irrigation. Turns out a hook is great for digging."

### Scene 4: The Final Vow / The Glass Dome

- **Key Event:** Angelica walks to the edge of the glass. She looks down.
- **Key Event:** Far below, a small, blue marble hangs in the void. Earth.
- **Key Event:** It looks peaceful from here. But she knows the truth. It's a ruin. A grave.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen joins her. "Where to now, Captain? Back home?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica shakes her head. "No. There's nothing for us there. We aren't refugees anymore."
- **Key Event:** She looks out at the stars. At the infinite possibilities.
- **Key Event:** "We aren't going back," she says firmly. "We’re going forward. We are the masters of the Stone Season now. And we’re never going to let the sun go out again."
- **Key Event:** She places her hand on the glass.
- **Key Event:** "Wherever the light takes us."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Makes a vow to navigate the ship not back to the past, but towards a new, unknown destination where they are no longer refugees, but explorers.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We aren't going back. We’re going forward. We are the masters of the Stone Season now. And we’re never going to let the sun go out again."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Wherever the light takes us."
