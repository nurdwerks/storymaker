## Chapter 20: Kaelen's Hunt

### Scene 1: The Tracking / Streets, Sector 7

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night walks through the rain. He doesn't feel the cold. All he feels is the burning circle on his wrist.
- **Key Event:** The Blood Pact. It pulses with every beat of Angelica's heart. A magical tether that drags him through the slums.
- **Key Event:** He hates it. He hates the leash. But right now, the leash is a compass.
- **Key Event:** His shadow stretches out in front of him, sliding over the wet cobblestones like oil. It points north. Toward the Flower District.
- **Key Event:** A thug steps out of an alley. "Credits, walker. Or your boots."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen doesn't stop. He doesn't look up. His shadow rises, a blade of darkness.
- **Key Event:** _Snick._
- **Key Event:** He steps over the body without breaking stride.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He is depicted as a relentless hunter who is physically and magically tethered to his target, suffering the shared agony of their bond.

### Scene 2: The Duke / Streets

- **Key Event:** A procession blocks the street. Gilded suspensor-chairs carried by cyborg slaves.
- **Key Event:** In the center chair sits Duke Grey. He is immense, wrapped in purple silk. His face is powdered white, hiding the rot of his own flesh.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen stops. He bows, stiffly.
- **Key Event:** "Night," the Duke wheezes. "I hear you lost my prize."
- **Key Event:** "I am retrieving it," Kaelen says.
- **Key Event:** "Her," the Duke corrects. "Not it. A living pet. I want her for the menagerie. She has such... spirited eyes. They will look lovely in a jar."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen's hand tightens on his sword hilt. "She is a fugitive of the Throne, my lord."
- **Key Event:** "She is mine," Grey hisses. "Bring her to me. Unmarked. Or I will have your skin for a cloak."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Duke Grey** — Introduced as a grotesque and depraved noble who views even the "Daughter of God" as a mere object to be acquired and displayed.

### Scene 3: The Location / Outside "Petal & Stem"

- **Key Event:** Kaelen stands outside the flower shop. It's a relic. Real glass windows. Real flowers.
- **Key Event:** The Pact burns hot here. She is inside.
- **Key Event:** Grey's soldiers surround the building. "Burn it down," the Lieutenant orders. "Flush her out."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen steps in front of the man. "No."
- **Key Event:** The Lieutenant blinks. "Excuse me?"
- **Key Event:** "The fire will damage the merchandise," Kaelen lies. But it's not a lie. He feels her fear physically. If she burns, he burns.
- **Key Event:** "My orders come from the Duke," the Lieutenant sneers.
- **Key Event:** "And mine come from the blood," Kaelen growls.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He makes his first overt move toward rebellion, prioritizing his connection to Angelica over the Duke’s commands.

### Scene 4: The Ultimatum / Outside "Petal & Stem"

- **Key Event:** A projection of Duke Grey appears from the Lieutenant's comms.
- **Key Event:** "Defiance, Night?" Grey asks. "Remember your sister. Remember what happened to her defiance."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen goes still. The memory of Lilith. The scream.
- **Key Event:** Something snaps inside him. The loyalty conditioning, stressed for years, finally fractures.
- **Key Event:** He draws his blade. Not the steel one. The shadow one.
- **Key Event:** "You killed Lilith," he says.
- **Key Event:** "She was property," Grey dismisses.
- **Key Event:** "Then you have no power over me," Kaelen says.
- **Key Event:** He turns his back on the projection. He faces the shop.
- **Key Event:** "I serve the Throne," he says. "Not the chair."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He breaks his lifelong conditioning of servitude, recognizing the "Throne" (and Angelica) as the ship's ultimate authority.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "I serve the Throne. Not the chair."

### Scene 5: The Betrayal's Echo / Outside "Petal & Stem"

- **Key Event:** "Kill him!" the Lieutenant shouts.
- **Key Event:** The Zombie-Cyborgs lunge.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen is a blur. He doesn't fight; he dances. A waltz of shadows and steel.
- **Key Event:** He dismantles them with surgical brutality. Limbs fly. Hydraulics hiss.
- **Key Event:** He clears a path to the door. He kicks it open.
- **Key Event:** He isn't doing this to save her. He's doing it to claim her. For himself. For the Throne.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He physically executes his betrayal of the Houses, destroying Grey's property to reach the woman who has become his new focus.
