## Chapter 17: The Null Raid

### Scene 1: The Breach / The Scrapyard Gate

- **Key Event:** It is 0300 hours. The Scrapyard is quiet, save for the hum of Hatcher's recyclers.
- **Key Event:** A noise at the North Gate. Not a bang. A hiss.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher wakes up instantly. He checks the monitor.
- **Key Event:** "Movement," he radios. "Sector 4. Perimeter breach."
- **Key Event:** He sees the sparks. High-pressure steam cutters.
- **Key Event:** They are slicing through the reinforced bulkheads like butter.
- **Key Event:** "They're not using guns," Hatcher realizes, watching the white plumes of steam. "They're using the ship against us. They've bypassed the safety valves! They're cutting us open with our own plumbing!"
- **Key Event:** The door falls inward with a clang.
- **Key Event:** Shadows flood in.

### Scene 2: The Silence / The Yard

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night intercepts the first wave.
- **Key Event:** He drops from a crane, sword drawn.
- **Key Event:** He expects shouts. Panic. Identifying cries.
- **Key Event:** Silence.
- **Key Event:** The attackers—the Nulls—move in perfect unison. They wear sleek, black armor. No insignias. Faces covered by smooth, blank masks.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen parries a strike from an electro-baton. The attacker doesn't grunt.
- **Key Event:** He kicks the Null in the chest. No reaction. The Null recovers instantly.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen feels a chill. Usually, he can sense his opponent's intent. Their fear. Their rhythm.
- **Key Event:** "There's no heartbeat," he yells to Angelica. "No rhythm. It's like fighting a door."
- **Key Event:** **The Mongrel**, a fierce scavenger who joined them in Chapter 8, holds the left flank.
- **Key Event:** "For the heap!" the Mongrel roars, swinging a large wrench.
- **Key Event:** A Null steps inside his guard. Efficient. Mechanical.
- **Key Event:** _Thunk._ A spear drives through the Mongrel's chest.
- **Key Event:** The Mongrel gaps. He brings the wrench down, crushing the Null's skull.
- **Key Event:** They both fall. Silent.

### Scene 3: The Loss / The Sorting Center

- **Key Event:** The raid is overwhelming. They are swarming the refugee tents.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sees a Null grab a child—a girl with blue hair.
- **Key Event:** The girl screams. The Null clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her toward a waiting transport.
- **Key Event:** Angelica raises her rifle. She aims.
- **Key Event:** Too many civilians in the crossfire.
- **Key Event:** "We have to help them!" Ria shouts.
- **Key Event:** "We can't!" Angelica grabs Ria's shoulder. "They're taking them for harvest! If we stay, we all get taken!"
- **Key Event:** The vents overhead are closing. The Nulls are sealing the exits.
- **Key Event:** "We have to go," Angelica commands, her voice breaking. "Do you hear me? GO!"
- **Key Event:** She creates a wall of fire with a fuel canister to cover their retreat. She has to leave the child behind.

### Scene 4: The Evacuation / The Gravity Shaft

- **Key Event:** They reach the emergency gravity shaft.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher punches the code.
- **Key Event:** "Bunker's compromised," he says.
- **Key Event:** He looks back at his Scrapyard. His kingdom of rust.
- **Key Event:** A Null throws an incendiary grenade into his workshop.
- **Key Event:** _BOOM._
- **Key Event:** Years of collection. His servers. His history. Gone in a fireball.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher doesn't flinch. He turns away.
- **Key Event:** "It’s just metal, kid," he tells Angelica, seeing her look of horror. "Metal can be replaced. Blood can’t."
- **Key Event:** A laser shot hits the console next to them.
- **Key Event:** **Scrap**, the little repair droid, beeps frantically.
- **Key Event:** The shaft controls are jammed. A "Logic-Spike" virus is eating the code.
- **Key Event:** Scrap plugs his interface jack into the port.
- **Key Event:** He uploads his own consciousness to override the virus.
- **Key Event:** The shaft opens.
- **Key Event:** Scrap's lights go dark. He slumps over, an empty shell.
- **Key Event:** "Scrap!" Hatcher shouts.
- **Key Event:** "No time!" Aris pushes them into the shaft.
- **Key Event:** They fall. The darkness swallows them.
- **Key Event:** "They were perfectly synchronized," Dr. Aris whispers in the dark. "Vane has achieved a local mesh network. We are outmatched."
- **Key Event:** Hatcher holds the lifeless metal body of Scrap. "He's not a mesh," he growls. "He was a friend."
