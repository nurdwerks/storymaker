## Chapter 4: Zephyr

### Scene 1: The Crash / "The Heap", Sector 4

- **Key Event:** Angelica lands in a toxic dumpster in a Mid-Sect district known as "The Heap"; despite severe injuries, she uses a shard of glass to painfully dig a tracking implant out of her forearm.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her endurance and priority for freedom are highlighted as she stoically performs self-surgery to disable the tracking device.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Shut up." (Addressing the blinking tracker)

### Scene 2: The Scavenger / The Dumpster

- **Key Event:** A scavenger named Zephyr, accompanied by a mechanical falcon named Midas, discovers Angelica and recognizes the desperation and grit required for her to remove her own tracker.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He is introduced as a cynical but observant scavenger with a golden cybernetic arm that runs on money.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "It's raining angels."

### Scene 3: The Scan / The Dumpster

- **Key Event:** Zephyr scans Angelica with his Cyber-Eye, revealing a 50-million-credit bounty for High Treason posted by Baron Gilded; he initially draws his blaster, intending to claim the reward.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She remains defiant even when held at gunpoint, showing no fear of death.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Fifty million credits. Baron Gilded himself put up the bounty. You're worth a Lambda-Class cruiser, sweetheart."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Do it. Spend the money on a better coat."

### Scene 4: The Recall / The Dumpster

- **Key Event:** Zephyr's cybernetic arm suddenly locks up—Baron Gilded is remotely activating the "Recall Protocol," a message flashing on his wrist display: "BRING HER TO ME OR LOSE THE ARM."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — His hatred for Gilded and his desperation are both exposed; Gilded still owns the admin codes to his arm.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded (via comm):** "Little bird. I know you have my prize. Bring her to the Club, or I shut down your wing. Permanently."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "That golden bastard. He never lets go of anything."

### Scene 5: The Conscience / The Dumpster

- **Key Event:** Spurred by his hatred of Gilded and the insistence of his droid Unit 734, Zephyr chooses to shoot down a Warden Hunter-Seeker drone instead of capturing Angelica.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He chooses to act against his financial interest and Gilded's orders, citing a personal debt of honor to someone who once helped him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Saving you is a terrible financial decision. And it's going to piss off Gilded. I must be drunk."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Because someone once helped me when they shouldn't have. I'm paying it forward. Very expensively."
