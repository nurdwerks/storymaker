## Chapter 11: The Construct

### Scene 1: The Airlock / Exterior Hull

- **Key Event:** Kaelen and Ria exit the airlock onto the ship's hull.
- **Detailed Description:** The airlock cycles, venting the remaining atmosphere with a sharp hiss that fades into the vacuum. Kaelen and Ria step out onto the vast, curved surface of the *Aeterna*. The starfield above is obscured by the massive, light-absorbing bulk of the Sphere, which hangs like a black sun. The only light comes from the ship's own running lights and the faint, eerie glow of the "flattened" crew members painted on the metal nearby. Ria moves with the heavy, clanking grace of her Titan armor, her magnetic boots locking onto the plating with each step. Kaelen, in a lighter void-suit, moves more fluidly, his cape drifting in the zero-G current.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen feels the oppressive weight of the Entity's presence. It presses against his mental shields like a physical headache. He has to focus intensely to maintain his "Shadow Self" in this environment, where the light is so absolute and the dark so artificial. He feels exposed, a speck of dust challenging a mountain.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He closes his eyes for a second, centering himself. He draws upon the shame of his past failures (the Night House, his brother) to fuel his magic, converting self-loathing into power.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "It's watching us. I can feel the focus."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Let it watch. I want it to see me when I break its toy."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen attempts to manifest a Shadow Construct.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen raises his hand, fingers splayed. He pulls at the shadows cast by Ria's armor and the ship's superstructure. The shadows detach from the metal, turning into a viscous, ink-like fluid. They swirl around his hand, coalescing into a giant, spectral hand—a "Shadow Construct." The construct is translucent and flickers with purple energy. He extends his will, sending the giant hand drifting toward the Planar Shard embedded in the hull.
- **Internal Conflict:** The magic feels heavy, sluggish. The Entity's presence is suppressing the natural chaos of the universe, making it harder to bend reality. Kaelen has to pour more energy than usual just to maintain the form.

- **Key Event:** The Shard reacts to the magic.
- **Detailed Description:** As the Shadow Construct approaches, the Shard spins faster. The frost patterns on the hull expand rapidly. It emits a high-pitched resonance that vibrates through the vacuum, transmitted via the hull plating directly into the soles of their boots. The Shard glows with a blinding white light, shifting its orientation to face Kaelen.

### Scene 2: The Feedback Loop

- **Key Event:** The Shadow Construct touches the Shard.
- **Detailed Description:** The moment the shadow fingers brush against the white geometric surface of the Shard, a violent reaction occurs. It is not an explosion, but a connection. A beam of "Null-Light" shoots up the arm of the Shadow Construct, turning the ink-black magic into rigid, white crystal. The crystallization spreads instantly toward Kaelen, traveling along the psychic link he maintains with the spell.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen gasps as the connection backfires. He expects physical pain, but instead, he feels "data." His mind is flooded with complex geometric equations, algorithms for planar collapse, and the Entity's cold, infinite calculation. It tries to "solve" him, to reduce his complex human consciousness into a simple, efficient formula.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He experiences the Entity's "thought process" for a split second. It is not malice; it is Order. Pure, unyielding Order that views his emotions and memories as "variables" to be eliminated. The sheer scale of the intellect nearly wipes his ego.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "It's so... loud. The math is so loud! get it out!"

- **Key Event:** Kaelen collapses on the hull.
- **Detailed Description:** The psychic backlash severs Kaelen's control. The Shadow Construct shatters into crystalline dust. Kaelen falls to his knees, clutching his helmet. He screams, the sound echoing only in his own comms loop. Blood begins to trickle from his nose, floating in the zero-G of his helmet. He convulses, his muscles locking up as his brain tries to process the alien information overload.

### Scene 3: The Rescue

- **Key Event:** The Shard fires razor-thin beams of light at the incapacitated Kaelen.
- **Detailed Description:** Sensing the threat is neutralized, the Shard goes on the offensive. It emits thin, laser-like planes of light. These are 2D cutting beams, capable of slicing through molecular bonds. They slash across the hull, leaving deep, glowing gouges in the metal.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria sees the beams tracking toward Kaelen. She knows his void-suit offers zero protection against something that cuts atoms.

- **Key Event:** Ria intervenes, using her Titan armor as a shield.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria activates her thrusters, launching herself between the Shard and Kaelen. She lands with a heavy thud, planting her shield-arm. The beams of light strike her armor. The "Titan" plating, made of ultra-dense alloy, hisses and sparks. The beams carve deep grooves into the metal, but the sheer density of the material holds. The armor is not magic; it is simple, stubborn matter, and for a moment, matter resists the math.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She grunts with effort, taking the hits that would have bisected the Prince. She enjoys the simplicity of it: protect the weak, take the hit.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I am the Wall! You don't get through the Wall!"

- **Key Event:** Ria drags Kaelen back toward the airlock.
- **Detailed Description:** With her shield-arm taking continuous fire, Ria grabs Kaelen by his harness with her free hand. She drags him across the hull, her boots digging into the metal for traction. The Shard continues to fire, chipping away at her armor. Warning alarms scream in her HUD as integrity levels drop—80%, 60%, 40%. Sparks fly from her shoulder joint as a beam severs a hydraulic line. She ignores the damage, focusing entirely on reaching the airlock.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen is semi-conscious, mumbling numbers and geometric proofs. Ria ignores his madness, treating him like a sack of cargo.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't think about it, Prince! Just move your legs! We're leaving!"

- **Key Event:** They breach the airlock safety zone.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria throws Kaelen into the open airlock and dives in after him. She hits the emergency cycle button. The outer door slams shut just as a final beam slices through the edge of the door frame, fusing the metal. The airlock pressurizes, the roar of returning air drowning out the silence of the void. Ria slumps against the wall, her armor smoking and scarred. Kaelen curls into a fetal position on the floor, still trembling from the psychic exposure.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria looks at the deep cuts in her armor. She realizes that if they had stayed out there ten seconds longer, she would have been sliced to ribbons. The "Wall" almost broke.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Next time... we bring a bigger gun. Or a calculator."
