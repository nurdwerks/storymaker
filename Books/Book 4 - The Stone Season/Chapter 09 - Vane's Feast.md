## Chapter 9: Vane's Feast

### Scene 1: The Observation / The Ventilation Shaft

- **Key Event:** The survivors establish a hidden surveillance nest in the ventilation shafts above the ship's central cafeteria.
- **Detailed Description:** The air in the shaft is stale and carries the metallic tang of recycled atmosphere mixed with the sickly-sweet scent of decay rising from below. Ria, Hatcher, and Zephyr lie prone on the grating, peering through the slats. Below them, the cafeteria—once a place of communal meals and noise—has been transformed into a temple of horror. The tables have been pushed to the walls, creating a large open space. In the center, a "throne" made of scavenged debris and bones sits atop a pile of crates. The room is filled with hundreds of "The Blighted"—infected humans in various stages of viral mutation. Their skin is grey and weeping, their eyes black voids. They do not move with the chaotic shambling of zombies; they stand in orderly rows, swaying slightly, humming a low, discordant note that vibrates through the floor.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria struggles with the urge to open fire immediately. Seeing humans reduced to this—mindless cattle worshiping their butcher—violates every instinct she has as a soldier. She grips her rifle until her knuckles are white, forcing herself to wait for intel. Hatcher, the Null, watches with detached curiosity, noting the lack of aggression in the infected. This is not a riot; it is a congregation.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He enters the room not as a monster, but as a savior. He wears tattered robes that float around him, his movements graceful and precise. He walks through the crowd of infected, touching them, blessing them. They recoil in ecstasy at his touch.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (whispering):** "Monsters shouldn't have followers. This isn't an infection; it's a cult."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "He's brainwashed the virus. That's... actually impressive, in a sick way."

### Scene 2: The Feeding / The Altar

- **Key Event:** Vane performs the "Sacrament of Flesh."
- **Detailed Description:** Vane ascends the throne. The humming of the Blighted rises in volume, becoming a chanting scream. Vane raises his left arm. The sleeve falls back, revealing skin that is translucent and shifting, alive with the nano-swarm that infests him. He takes a ceremonial obsidian knife and, with a calm smile, slices a long strip of flesh from his own forearm. There is no blood, only a silver ooze of nanites. He holds the strip of meat out to the front row of the infected. They fall upon it with ravenous hunger, tearing it apart.
- **Detailed Description:** As the survivors watch in horror, Vane's arm begins to knit itself back together. The nanites swarm over the wound, rebuilding muscle and skin in seconds. He slices again. And again. He is feeding the multitude with his own regenerating body. The sound of wet chewing fills the silence between the chants. The infected who eat seem to calm down, their eyes clearing momentarily, as if the nanites in Vane's flesh are temporarily suppressing the virus or granting them a moment of clarity.
- **Internal Conflict:** Hatcher feels a wave of nausea. The self-cannibalism is grotesque, but the logic is sound. Vane is the only renewable food source in a sealed sector. He is literally keeping them alive with himself, binding them to him biologically and spiritually. It is a perversion of the Eucharist.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He demonstrates complete, narcissistic devotion to his "children." He does not see this as sacrifice; he sees it as spreading his essence. He wants to be inside all of them.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Eat, my children. Father provides. Father always provides. My flesh is your strength. My blood is your wine."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "He's feeding them. He's feeding them _himself_. It's an infinite loop of consumption."

### Scene 3: The Sermon / The Gospel of Resonance

- **Key Event:** Vane preaches to the satiated Blighted.
- **Detailed Description:** His voice, amplified by the acoustics of the room, is hypnotic. He speaks not of cure, but of evolution. He tells them that the "Stone Season"—the hardening of the world, the scarcity—is a test. He claims that the "Resonance," the vibration that is destroying the ship, is actually a call to a higher state of being. He frames their infection as a gift, a shedding of weak human flesh for something durable and eternal. He holds up his regenerated arm as proof.
- **Detailed Description:** The infected listen with rapt attention. Some weep black tears. Vane's charisma is palpable; even from the vents, the survivors can feel the pull of his logic. It is the logic of the desperate: when you are in hell, the man who tells you it is actually heaven becomes your god.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr feels a chill. He knows how easy it is to manipulate the hopeless. He sees Vane doing exactly what the politicians in the Zenith did, but with biology instead of credits.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — His scientific mind has merged completely with his god-complex. He views the plague as his greatest experiment and himself as the successful prototype.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "We are the next step. The meat that thinks. The hunger that dreams. Do not fear the change. Embrace the breaking. Only the broken can be rebuilt."

### Scene 4: The Retreat / The Vents

- **Key Event:** The survivors withdraw to avoid detection.
- **Detailed Description:** A drone—one of Vane's "Cherubs," a flying construct made of bone and metal—drifts near the ventilation grate. Its sensors sweep the darkness. Ria signals the retreat. They crawl backward, inch by inch, silent as ghosts. They move until they are safe in a maintenance junction three levels up.
- **Detailed Description:** Once safe, they regroup. The image of the feast is burned into their minds. They realize that Vane is not just a warlord; he is building an army of zealots who are biologically programmed to love him. Killing him won't just be a battle; it will be a heresy that will turn thousands of infected against them.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria checks her ammunition. She calculates the number of infected versus their supplies. The math is impossible. But she pushes the doubt down. She is a soldier. She identifies the target, and she engages.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria (The Iron Vanguard)** — She refuses to be cowed by the horror. She converts the fear into tactical data. Vane is a target. The infected are hostiles. The solution is ballistics.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Monsters die like men. We just need more bullets. Mark the location. We come back when we have the heavy ordnance."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "And maybe a flamethrower. Or two. Just to be sure."

### Scene 5: The Spider's Assessment

- **Key Event:** Lady Vesper observes from the shadows.
- **Detailed Description:** **Lady Vesper** is not in the vents, but she is watching. From a secured balcony behind one-way glass, she observes the "Sacrament." She sips a synthetic nutrient pouch—clean, sterile. She watches Vane peeling his own skin. She does not feel awe; she feels calculation. She taps a note into her datapad. Vane has transitioned from a political asset to a biological hazard. A leader who eats himself cannot govern. She begins to draft the contingency protocols.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Vesper:** "Passion is inefficient. He is burning his candle at both ends. I must ensure I am not holding it when it goes out."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Vesper** — She shows her lack of loyalty; she serves the hierarchy, not the man. When the man breaks, she prepares to replace him.
