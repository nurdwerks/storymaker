## Chapter 15: The Battery

### Scene 1: The Choice / The Cargo Lift

- **Key Event:** The survivors discover a charged Zenith Core battery in an abandoned lift shaft.
- **Detailed Description:** The group—Angelica, Aris, Ria, and a few others—are huddled in a derelict cargo lift that is stuck between levels. The wind howls through the shaft, carrying snow and ice. They are freezing. Aris, scanning the lift's control panel, finds a single "Core Battery"—a high-density power cell that still holds a 98% charge. This is a fortune in the Stone Season. It contains enough energy to power their portable heaters for a week, or to power the lift's emergency transponder for a single, high-gain burst.
- **Internal Conflict:** The choice is immediate and brutal. They can be warm tonight and live to freeze next week, or they can bet everything on a distress signal that might not be heard. The cold is a physical enemy, gnawing at their extremities. The temptation to plug the battery into the heater is overwhelming. Zephyr is shivering uncontrollably, his lips blue. Ria is rubbing her arms, her cybernetics sluggish in the low temperature. They look at the glowing battery with a hunger that rivals their need for food.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "The signal reach the Spire remnants. We could call for an extraction. We could be saved. Statistically, the Spire has resources."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Or we could freeze to death tonight. Extraction doesn't help frozen meat. We take the heat."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Heat feels good. Signals feel... imaginary. Please, Captain. Just one night of warmth."

### Scene 2: The Stand / The Debate

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Aris argue for the long game.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica steps between Ria and the battery. She argues that surviving one more night is meaningless if they don't have an exit strategy. They are dying by inches. A signal is a chance for a cure, not just a band-aid. Aris supports her with logic, calculating their caloric burn rate versus their food supply. They will starve before they freeze. He projects a holographic graph onto the rusty wall, showing their declining vitals. The math is cold, but undeniable.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica sees the desperation in her crew's eyes. They are tired of hope; they want comfort. She has to force them to choose suffering now for potential salvation later. It is the burden of command. She feels like a tyrant, denying her people the one thing they crave. But she knows that a good leader sometimes has to be cruel to be kind.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She risks a mutiny to enforce strategic thinking. She denies them the immediate relief of warmth.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If we don't call now, we're just waiting to die in a different room. We have to take the gamble. We didn't come this far to be comfortable corpses."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're gambling with our lives, Captain."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm gambling with our deaths. There's a difference. We use the battery for the signal. That is an order."

### Scene 3: The Signal / The Broadcast

- **Key Event:** They rig the transponder and send the signal.
- **Detailed Description:** Aris wires the battery into the ancient radio unit. The lights on the console flare to life, blinding in the gloom. The hum of the transmitter warms the air slightly. Angelica takes the microphone. She broadcasts on the "Imperial Emergency Band," a frequency reserved for high-priority distress calls. She identifies herself, hoping that her name still carries weight in the ruins of the Zenith. She repeats the message on all frequencies, her voice cracking with the strain.
- **Detailed Description:** The static clears. A voice responds. It is mechanical, distorted, but human. It asks for identification and coordinates. The crew cheers silently. Someone is out there. Someone is listening. The relief in the small cabin is palpable. Zephyr stops shivering for a moment, hope warming him more than the heater ever could.
- **Internal Conflict:** Aris frowns. He analyzes the signal latency. The response was too fast. It didn't come from the Spire; it came from orbit. Or from a relay that shouldn't be active. He taps his datapad, trying to triangulate the source.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Radio Voice (Static):** "...Sector 12... identify... unauthorized signal... quarantine active... state biometric ID..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "This is Angelica Ward. Daughter of Elena Ward. We are survivors. Requesting immediate extraction."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Radio Voice:** "...Coordinates locked. Stand by for retrieval."

### Scene 4: The Betrayal / The Trap

- **Key Event:** The signal brings hunters, not rescuers.
- **Detailed Description:** High above them, the clouds part. Not for a rescue dropship, but for a "Hunter-Killer" drone—a sleek, black machine marked with Vane's sigil. The radio voice changes tone, dropping the pre-recorded mask. It is Vane's voice now, mocking them. He thanks them for updating their location. The realization hits them like a physical blow. They have been tricked.
- **Detailed Description:** The drone fires a marker flare, painting the cargo lift with red smoke. In the distance, the roar of engines signals the approach of a Vane raiding party. They haven't called for help; they've rung the dinner bell. The red light of the flare illuminates their faces—pale, terrified, and betrayed.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica is horrified. She made the "right" strategic choice, and it has doomed them. Aris realizes that Vane has hacked the emergency bands, turning every cry for help into a trap. It is a brilliant, cruel tactic. He feels a begrudging respect for Vane's thoroughness.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — He appreciates the trap even as it closes on him. He respects Vane's efficiency.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "It's not a rescue. It's a target-lock. We just gave them the coordinates. Clever. He weaponized hope."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Run. Run now! Leave the battery!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I told you. We should have taken the heat. Now we die cold."
