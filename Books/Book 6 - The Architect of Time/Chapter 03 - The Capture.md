## Chapter 3: The Capture

### Scene 1: The Trap

- **Key Event:** The Aftermath.
- **Detailed Description:** The Smilodon corpse lies cooling in the mud. Angelica stands over it, her chest heaving, adrenaline still flooding her system. She wipes the blood from her knife on her flight suit. The jungle is silent—too silent. The kind of silence that happens when a apex predator is dead, but something worse is watching.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** A faint sound breaks the stillness. A _swish_. Like a whip cutting through air.
- **Key Event:** The Attack.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks up, her combat reflexes kicking in, but it is too late. The canopy above explodes downwards.
- **Key Event:** The Net.
- **Detailed Description:** A massive net, woven from thick, fibrous vines and weighted with heavy river stones, drops on her. It hits with the force of a falling tree. It pins her to the ground, knocking the wind out of her.
- **Key Event:** The Struggle.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica thrashes. She tries to cut the vines with her knife, but the weave is too thick, and the weight of the stones presses her arms to her sides. The more she moves, the tighter the mesh becomes. It is a Chinese finger trap made of jungle engineering.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Panic flares, then is squashed by training. Assess. Immobilized. Weapon access reduced.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Grunting) "Clever. Primitive, but... effective."

### Scene 2: The Hunters

- **Key Event:** The Reveal.
- **Detailed Description:** The bushes around the clearing part. Six figures step out. They move with fluid, predatory grace.
- **Key Event:** The Appearance.
- **Detailed Description:** They are human. Tall, muscular, their skin painted with stripes of ash and ochre to blend into the shadows. They wear furs and leather armor.
- **Key Event:** The Weapons.
- **Detailed Description:** They hold spears tipped with black obsidian—volcanic glass chipped to a razor edge. The points glint in the filtered sunlight.
- **Key Event:** The Tactics.
- **Detailed Description:** They don't rush in screaming. They encircle her silently. Spears out. Shields of woven bark up. They move as a unit.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Angelica stops struggling. She analyzes them. This isn't a mob. This is a squad. It reminds her of Ria's training simulations—the "Wolf Pack" protocol. Synchronized movement. Overlapping fields of fire (or spears, in this case).
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Pack tactics. Disciplined. Hierarchy. You're not random scavengers, are you?"

- **Key Event:** The Examination.
- **Detailed Description:** The hunters stare at her. They look at her silver flight suit, gleaming like metal skin. They look at her pale complexion.
- **Key Event:** The Test.
- **Detailed Description:** One of them steps forward. He pokes her thigh with the butt of his spear. He is testing to see if she is real.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hunter:** (Muttering to his comrade) "Sky Demon. Look at the skin. Metal."

### Scene 3: The King

- **Key Event:** The Arrival.
- **Detailed Description:** The circle of spears parts. A hush falls over the hunters. A giant walks through the opening.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar.
- **Detailed Description:** He is massive. Seven feet of muscle and scar tissue. He wears a cloak made from the pelt of a dire wolf, the head resting on his shoulder. A necklace of teeth hangs around his thick neck.
- **Key Event:** The Presence.
- **Detailed Description:** He radiates authority. He is the Alpha. He stops in front of the net, looking down at her trapped form. His eyes are not wild; they are intelligent, calculating, and cold.
- **Key Event:** The Discovery.
- **Detailed Description:** He spots the titanium shard she still clutches in her hand—the piece of wreckage she used to kill the cat.
- **Key Event:** The Interaction.
- **Detailed Description:** He reaches through the gaps in the net. Angelica tries to slash him, snarling like a cornered animal.
- **Key Event:** The Strength.
- **Detailed Description:** He catches her wrist. His grip is like an iron vice. He doesn't flinch. He isn't angry. He is bored. He squeezes. The pressure is immense. Angelica gasps, her fingers involuntarily opening.
- **Key Event:** The Assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar picks up the shard. He tests the edge with his thumb. A line of red blood appears. He nods, impressed.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Good metal. Better than stone."

- **Key Event:** The Verdict.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks at Angelica. He doesn't see a person. He sees resources.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** (Waving his hand dismissively) "Meat."

- **Key Event:** The Objection.
- **Detailed Description:** Two hunters grab the edges of the net and begin to drag her.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Hey! I am not food! I am Angelica! I am a human being!"

- **Key Event:** The Philosophy.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar doesn't turn around. He keeps walking.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Meat talks. Demons scream. We will see which you are. Until then... you are in a net. So you are prey."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Screaming) "I am the Commander of the Zenith! I will burn your village!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Loud prey."

### Scene 4: The Cage

- **Key Event:** The Journey.
- **Detailed Description:** They drag her for miles. The journey is a blur of mud, thorns, and humiliation. She is bounced over roots and dragged through streams.
- **Key Event:** The Settlement.
- **Detailed Description:** They reach the settlement. It is impressive. A cluster of caves and huts clinging to a limestone cliffside, protected by a natural moat. Fires burn in stone pits. Small mammoths graze in a pen. Children run naked through the mud.
- **Key Event:** The Prison.
- **Detailed Description:** They carry the net to the center of the village. They dump her into a cage.
- **Key Event:** The Construction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica scrambles to her feet. She grabs the bars. They are white and curved.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Not wood. Bone. Massive, curved ribs. Mammoth? Or something bigger. Dinosaur.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You built a jail out of a ribcage. That's... disturbingly metal."

- **Key Event:** The Celebration.
- **Detailed Description:** The hunters celebrate their catch. They dance around the cage, chanting. Women and children come out to gawk. They poke sticks at her through the gaps.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Crowd:** "Sky Demon caught! Sky Demon caught!"

- **Key Event:** The Irony.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica sits in the mud at the center of the cage. She wipes the dirt from her face. She looks at the bars. She starts to laugh. It is a dry, bitter chuckle that turns into a full belly laugh.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Vane called me a savage once. He said I belonged in the mud. He said I was too wild for the Palace."

- **Key Event:** The Acceptance.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the tribe. At the raw, brutal, honest life around her.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If he could see me now, he'd die laughing. I've finally found my people... and they put me in a zoo."

- **Key Event:** The Resignation.
- **Detailed Description:** She leans her head back against a rib-bone and closes her eyes.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Well played, universe. Well played. Now... how do I get out?"
