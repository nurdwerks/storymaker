- **Key Event:** His skin peels away into binary code. His bones turn into geometry.
- **Key Event:** In seconds, he is gone. There is no ash. Just empty air where a man used to be. The ultimate narcissist is forgotten instantly.

### Scene 2: The Reaction

- **Key Event:** The Zealots, seeing their god reject their prophet, break. Some faint; others flee.

- **Key Event:** The Hyper-Cube folds back into itself. The Entity vanishes from the room.
- **Key Event:** Time resumes. The alarms start blaring again. The "God" has left, but the fleet outside remains.
