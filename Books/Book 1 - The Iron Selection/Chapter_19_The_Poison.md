## Chapter 19: The Poison

### Scene 1: The Rival

- **Key Event:** Kaelen scouts Sector 4 (The Slag-Heaps).
- **Detailed Description:** Sector 4 is a wasteland of industrial refuse—mountains of twisted metal, broken glass, and toxic runoff from the Foundry above. The air is heavy with the smell of ozone and rotting chemical sludge. Kaelen moves through the shadows, his silhouette broken by the jagged terrain. He has been awake for thirty hours. His movements are precise, but his reaction times are degrading by microseconds. He stops near a ridge of rusted girders, sensing a disturbance in the ambient sound of the sector.

- **Key Event:** The ambush by Squad Silver.
- **Detailed Description:** Three figures emerge from the slag. They are Squad Silver—high-ranking candidates from the Upper Tier. They wear polished chrome armor and carry expensive energy pikes. They do not speak; they coordinate via encrypted comms. They fan out, attempting to flank Kaelen. Kaelen does not retreat. He draws his dual blades.

- **Key Event:** The fight.
- **Detailed Description:** The engagement lasts six seconds. The first attacker lunges with a pike. Kaelen uses Shadow-Step, disappearing into the darkness of a girder's shadow and reappearing behind the attacker. He severs the hydraulic line of the attacker's knee joint with a surgical cut. The man collapses. The second attacker swings a mace. Kaelen deflects the blow with his armored gauntlet and delivers a pressure-point strike to the man's throat, crushing the windpipe. The third attacker hesitates. Kaelen throws a knife; it pins the attacker's foot to the ground.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You are wasting my caloric intake."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Squad Silver Leader:** "You're a monster, Night!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Fear is a better messenger than a corpse. Leave."

- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen sheathes his blades. He looks at his left hand. It is trembling. It is a tremor of fatigue. He clenches his fist to stop it. He despises the weakness of his biological form.

### Scene 2: The Dart

- **Key Event:** The hidden sniper strikes.
- **Detailed Description:** The ambush was a distraction. From a high vantage point atop a crane, a fourth figure fires. There is no muzzle flash, just the soft _thwip_ of a compressed air launcher. Kaelen hears it a fraction of a second too late. He turns, but the projectile strikes him in the side of the neck, finding the soft seal between his helmet and chest plate.

- **Key Event:** The poison takes effect.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen rips the dart free. It is black glass, shattered now, but the payload has been delivered. It contained iridescent, oily liquid—Prima-Materia. It is unrefined magical waste, highly volatile. It burns like acid. Black veins immediately begin to spread from the wound, spiderwebbing down his chest and up his face. His vision blurs. His connection to the shadows—his Resonance—flickers and recoils. The shadows around him retreat, as if repelled by the corruption in his blood.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Coward."

### Scene 3: The Collapse

- **Key Event:** Kaelen attempts to reach shelter.
- **Detailed Description:** He stumbles away from the open ground, dragging himself into the wreckage of a collapsed turbine housing. His legs feel heavy, disconnected. He leans against the cold metal wall, sliding down to a sitting position. He activates his internal bio-monitor.

  - **Heart Rate:** 40 BPM (dropping).
  - **Toxicity:** 85%.
  - **Resonance Status:** Critical Failure.

- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen accepts the calculation. He is dying. There is no fear, only a cold disappointment in his own failure to predict the sniper variables. He closes his eyes, preparing for deletion.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — Even in death, he upholds his code. He does not call for help. To call for help is to admit inability to function.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Weakness is death. Weakness is authorized for deletion. Solitude is the only truth."

### Scene 4: The Discovery

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Ria find him.
- **Detailed Description:** Hours later, Squad Iron is patrolling the sector perimeter. Ria spots a boot sticking out of the turbine housing. She approaches cautiously, weapon raised. She kicks the boot. No response. She peers inside. Kaelen is slumped over, his skin pale grey, the black veins now covering half his face. He is barely breathing.

- **Key Event:** The debate on what to do.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria looks at the body. She looks at Angelica. The pragmatic choice is clear.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He's gone, Angel. Look at him. It's Prima-poisoning. Even if he wakes up, he'll be crippled."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Leave him. He's House Night. He'd leave us in a heartbeat. He literally told us he would."

- **Key Event:** Angelica's decision.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica kneels beside Kaelen. She touches his neck, avoiding the black veins. The pulse is thready, irregular. She looks at Ria. Her face is set in a line of stubborn refusal. She sees Kaelen not as a person, but as a component of their survival engine.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He's part of the engine. We don't throw away parts until they are broken beyond repair."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He IS broken beyond repair! That's magic-rot!"

- **Key Event:** The evacuation order.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up. She grabs Kaelen's arm. It is dead weight.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Even gods bleed. And when they do, the sharks come. We aren't sharks, Ria. We're wolves."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Wolves eat things too, Angel."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Yeah. But wolves hunt in a pack. Grab his legs."

- **Key Event:** They carry him.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria sighs, a sound of heavy resignation, but she holsters her weapon. She grabs Kaelen's legs. Using her Titan strength, she lifts the bulk of his weight easily. Angelica supports his head. Together, they move out of the Slag-Heaps, heading for a safer cave system in Sector 6.
