## Chapter 11: Blackmail

### Scene 1: The Showers

- **Key Event:** The setting.
- **Detailed Description:** The communal showers of Sector G-4 are a grim affair. The tiles are cracked and stained with rust. The water comes out in sputtering bursts, cycling between freezing cold and scalding hot. Angelica stands under a lukewarm stream, watching the grime of the dojo swirl down the drain. She is trying to wash away the adrenaline of the fight, the memory of her kinetic outburst.

- **Key Event:** The interruption.
- **Detailed Description:** Suddenly, the water shuts off. Not just her shower, but the entire block. The pipes groove and go silent. Angelica wipes the soap from her eyes and freezes. Ria is standing in the doorway. Unlike Angelica, who is wrapped only in a thin towel, Ria is fully clothed. She wears her armored vest, combat boots, and fatigues. She fills the doorway, blocking the exit. Her presence sucks the air out of the small room.

- **Key Event:** The intimidation.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria steps inside. Her boots crunch on the wet tile. She looms over Angelica like a tank in a flower garden. Angelica backs up until her shoulders hit the cold wall. She feels small, exposed, and incredibly vulnerable.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Nice trick in the dojo, Ward. You made quite a mess. Three concussions. One fractured sternum. Impressive for a runt."

### Scene 2: The Leverage

- **Key Event:** The accusation.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria leans in. She smells of gun oil and metallic ozone. She places a hand on the wall next to Angelica's head—a cage of flesh and steel.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I saw the lockers. I checked them after the meds took Toro away. Three hundred pounds of reinforced steel, bent like tin foil. No scuff marks. No impact trauma. Just... shaped."

- **Key Event:** The identification.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria's voice drops to a whisper.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I know what kinetic displacement looks like. My father serves in the Heavy Infantry. I've seen mages do that with staffs and gauntlets. But you? You didn't use a spell. You didn't have a focus. You just... pushed. You used pure will. That's raw resonance."

- **Key Event:** The threat.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria explains the consequences. In the Zenith, unlicensed magic is a capital offense. But worse than death is the "Special" designation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You know what they do to freaks in the Zenith? They don't just kill them. They send them to the 'Special' wing. The dissection labs. They take you apart to see how you tick. And you don't come back. You just disappear."

### Scene 3: The Deal

- **Key Event:** The twist.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica braces herself for the blackmail—credits, chores, servitude. But Ria pulls back. She sighs, a sound that deflates her imposing posture. She looks... tired.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I'm failing Theoretical Resonance."

- **Key Event:** The vulnerability.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria leans against the sinks, crossing her massive arms. The cruelty leaves her face, replaced by genuine desperation.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Shows fear for the first time. She is invincible physically, but mentally she is drowning in the academic rigors of the Academy.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I can punch through a wall, but I can't calculate the frequency of the shield I'm punching. If I fail the final exam next week, I get recycled. They'll strip my rank and send me to the Mines. I won't go to the Mines, Ward. I won't."

- **Key Event:** The proposal.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria looks at Angelica. The predator becomes the negotiator.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're smart. I see you reading the tech manuals for fun. You understand the math. So here's the deal. You tutor me. You make sure I pass. And I make sure the other squads don't break your fingers."

- **Key Event:** The calculation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica analyzes the offer. It is a symbiotic relationship. She is a glass cannon—powerful offensive output, but zero defensive capability. Ria is a fortress with no artillery. Together, they cover each other's weaknesses. It is logical.

### Scene 4: The Pact

- **Key Event:** The handshake.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica tightens her towel and steps forward. She extends her small, scarred hand. Ria looks at it, then grabs it. Her hand is heavy, grey, and cold to the touch—like shaking hands with a statue. The Steel-Hide bond has already deadened her skin temperature.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Deal. But we do it my way. You listen. You study. If you slack off, I walk."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't push your luck, Runt. Just get the numbers in my head."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't screw this up. Or I'll break you myself. I won't let them recycle me."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They won't. I can fix anything. Even your grades."

- **Key Event:** The kindness.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria nods, satisfied. She turns to leave. At the door, she pauses. She reaches for the master water valve on the wall. She twists it. The pipes shudder, and the water comes back on—this time, steaming hot. It is a luxury.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — A tiny act of kindness in a cold world, showing that beneath the armor, there is still a person.

- **Key Event:** The alliance.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica steps back under the hot spray. The steam fills the room. She isn't alone anymore. She has a tank.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'll keep them off your back. You keep me in the class. We survive together."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't get sentimental, Silt-Rat. It's just business."

### Scene 5: The Anomaly Report

- **Key Event:** Data flagged for review.
- **Detailed Description:** In the Academy's medical monitoring center, **Dr. Aris (The Sleepless Eye)** reviews the sensor logs from the dojo incident. The kinetic displacement readings are off the charts—three standard deviations beyond normal combat parameters. He cross-references with Candidate Ward's Resonance profile: officially listed as "negligible." He runs the numbers twice. The discrepancy is undeniable. He creates a sealed file, encrypting it with his personal cipher. The Ward girl is far more than she appears.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris (dictating notes):** "Candidate Ward exhibited unregistered kinetic Resonance. Magnitude: combat-lethal. Origin: endogenous. Recommend discrete observation protocol. Do not alert Headmaster. Yet."
