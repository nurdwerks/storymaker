## Chapter 1: The Crash

### Scene 1: The Crater

- **Key Event:** The awakening.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica Ward regains consciousness. She is lying in a crater of her own making, a scar in the earth filled with steaming mud, ash, and the smell of ozone. The impact site is a chaotic mess of shattered trees and scorched earth. Her body is half-submerged in a slurry of soil and superheated water. Every nerve ending is firing simultaneously, a chorus of pain that threatens to drag her back into the dark. Her ears are ringing with a high-pitched tinnitus that masks the sounds of the jungle. She coughs, expelling grit and blood from her lungs.

- **Key Event:** The assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** She forces herself to sit up. The movement causes a spike of agony in her ribs—at least two are broken. She looks down at her Interface Suit. It is a wreck. The nano-weave armor, designed to withstand kinetic rounds and vacuum exposure, is shredded in multiple places, revealing bruised skin underneath. The blue glow of the power lines is erratic, flickering like a dying pulse. She touches the back of her head and her fingers come away wet with blood.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes she has fallen from the void. Instead of panicking, she categorizes her injuries: Concussion, ribs, internal bleeding, suit failure. She forces herself to stand despite the intense pain. She refuses to die lying down.

- **Key Event:** The survival instinct.
- **Detailed Description:** She stumbles to the edge of the crater. The mud sucks at her boots, trying to keep her. She drags herself up the steep, scorched bank, her fingers digging into the roots of strange, fern-like plants. She collapses at the top, gasping for air. The air here is thick, humid, and rich with oxygen—too rich. It makes her head spin.

### Scene 2: The Check

- **Key Event:** The tech failure.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica attempts to access her technology. She taps the wrist-comp on her left arm. The screen is cracked; it flickers once and dies. She taps her earpiece, trying to hail the _Zenith_ or any orbital relay. "Ward to Command. Status report." Heavy static is the only reply. The silence is absolute and terrifying. She is cut off.

- **Key Event:** The construct check.
- **Detailed Description:** She reaches out with her mind, trying to find Aeon, her mechanical gryphon and neural construct. Usually, his presence is a comforting hum in the back of her skull, a second heartbeat. Now, it is faint, distant, like a radio signal fading into deep space. He is in critical hibernation. The temporal displacement drained his core to near zero.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon (Internal Voice):** "Protect... the... Pilot... System... Critical..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Aeon! Wake up! Analyze location!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "...Power... failing... Sleep... mode..."

- **Key Event:** The vulnerability.
- **Detailed Description:** The connection severs. The silence in her head is worse than the silence on the comms. Without Aeon, she cannot manipulate time. She cannot rewind injuries or slow down projectiles. She is stripped of her god-like status. She looks at her hands—shaking, dirty, and covered in dried blood.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She feels a surge of terror. For the first time in years, she is just a mortal girl from the Undercity. She is vulnerable. But she swallows the fear. "I am broken," she whispers. "But I am alive."

### Scene 3: The Sky

- **Key Event:** The environment.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands and looks around. The jungle is alien. It is not the hydroponic gardens of the Zenith or the fungal forests of the Silt. It is ancient, savage, and vibrant. Massive trees with trunks as wide as hab-blocks pierce the canopy. Bioluminescent fungi coat the forest floor, casting an eerie blue and purple glow that illuminates the mist. Insects the size of dinner plates buzz through the air. The heat is oppressive.

- **Key Event:** The navigation attempt.
- **Detailed Description:** She finds a clearing and looks up at the night sky, hoping to triangulate her position using the stars. She knows the star charts of the entire sector by heart. She looks for the familiar constellations—the Iron Belt, the Trade Route, the Void Gap. They are gone. The stars are different. They are brighter, more numerous, and in the wrong positions. The moon is there, but it looks... closer. Larger. And the scarring from the Lunar colonies is missing. It is a pristine, white orb.

- **Key Event:** The realization.
- **Detailed Description:** She stares at the moon. The lack of orbital infrastructure—no trade rings, no defense platforms, no twinkling lights of the Helium-3 refineries—confirms her fears. She checks the vegetation again. Giant ferns. Cycads. Things that went extinct on Earth millions of years ago.

### Scene 4: The Reality

- **Key Event:** The truth.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica realizes she didn't just fall through space. The singularity she destabilized didn't teleport her; it displaced her chronologically. She has fallen through the cracks of reality.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I am not lost in space. I am lost in time."

- **Key Event:** The despair and the spark.
- **Detailed Description:** She sinks to her knees. The weight of it crushes her. Everyone she knows is not just dead; they haven't been born yet. Billions of years of history stand between her and her life. She is the only human being on the planet—perhaps in the universe. Despair claws at her throat. She could endure war, torture, and starvation. But this solitude? This absolute erasure?

- **Character Defining Moment:** **Angelica Ward** — She stays on her knees for exactly one minute. Then, she stands up. She wipes the blood from her face. She looks at the savage jungle, at the hostile world that wants to eat her. A cold, hard pride ignites in her chest. She is the Architect. She survived the Iron Selection. She survived Vane. She will survive this.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ "If I am in the past, then I am the first. I don't need to find a path. I will build one."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Build the future again. Step one: Survive the night."
