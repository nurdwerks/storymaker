## Chapter 10: The Hidden Door

### Scene 1: The Sniper's Secret / Rusted Gantry Crane

- **Key Event:** Ghost (Unit 44) eliminates a loose end.
- **Detailed Description:** High above the Mag-Lev Highway, perched on the rusting arm of a gantry crane, **Ghost** lies prone. The wind whips her camouflage cloak, but she is perfectly still. Through her scope, she watches a figure moving below—**Kael**, a former squadmate from the Praetorian Guard. Kael has been tracking her, following the digital breadcrumbs she left while hacking the grid for Ria. Ghost knows that if Kael reports her location, Ria's entire operation is compromised. She adjusts her aim, calculating windage and the Coriolis effect. She feels a flicker of regret—Kael was a good soldier—but she suppresses it.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ghost battles her conditioning. The Praetorian Code demands loyalty to the squad. But her loyalty has shifted to Ria, the only person who treated her as a human rather than a weapon. She whispers a mantra to steady her heart rate.
- **Key Event:** The shot is fired.
- **Detailed Description:** The rifle barks once, a suppressed *thwip*. Below, Kael drops mid-stride, dead before he hits the ground. Ghost packs her gear instantly. She strips the "Unit 44" patch from her shoulder and drops it into the wind.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ghost** — She renounces her former life and name. She chooses to be a traitor to the state to be loyal to a friend.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ghost:** "Target down. My name is Ghost. And I don't exist."

### Scene 2: The Ride / Mag-Lev Highway

- **Key Event:** The chase begins.
- **Detailed Description:** On the highway below, Hatcher drives a stolen, dilapidated hover-car. The vehicle shakes and rattles as he pushes the engine past the red line. Inside, Angelica and Zephyr are strapped in, watching the rear monitors. The highway is a blur of neon lights and rain. Suddenly, the comms system shrieks with static. A voice cuts through—**Ria**. She has hacked their frequency.
- **Detailed Description:** Behind them, a black shape tears through the traffic. It is Ria on a military-grade Interceptor bike. The bike is a predator, sleek and armored. Ria weaves through the civilian cars, using them as obstacles to herd Hatcher's car. Her voice is calm, professional, terrifying.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels the fear of the hunted. Ria is not just a pursuer; she is a force of nature. Angelica realizes that her "friends" from the Academy are now her executioners.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She treats the high-speed pursuit as a tactical exercise. No anger, just efficiency.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (over comms):** "Pull over, Hatcher. You're driving a coffin. Surrender the asset, and you walk away."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "I don't take orders from traffic cops. Hold on!"

### Scene 3: The Ram / The Tunnel Entrance

- **Key Event:** Ria engages the vehicle physically.
- **Detailed Description:** The Interceptor pulls alongside the car. Zephyr leans out the window, firing his blaster. Ria doesn't flinch. She raises her cybernetic arm, the metal plating deflecting the bolts with sparks. She steers the bike into the side of the car. *Slam*. The car shudders, grinding against the guardrail. Sparks shower the windshield.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria leaps. At 200 kph, she abandons her bike (which auto-pilots) and jumps onto the roof of the car. The metal groans under the impact. Her cybernetic fist punches through the sunroof, grabbing Zephyr by the collar. The wind roars into the cabin.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr stares into Ria's eyes. They are cold, devoid of the friendship they once shared. He realizes she is going to kill him without hesitation.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She demonstrates overwhelming physical power. She is the Iron Vanguard.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Hello, traitor. End of the line."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "You're crazy! Get off the roof!"

### Scene 4: The Save / The Tunnel

- **Key Event:** Angelica makes a choice.
- **Detailed Description:** The car is hurtling toward a narrow maintenance tunnel. There isn't enough clearance for Ria on the roof. Ria demands surrender, tightening her grip on Zephyr's throat. Angelica has seconds. She can try to shoot Ria, or she can save Zephyr.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica grabs the wheel from Hatcher. She jerks the car violently to the left, slamming it against the tunnel wall. The impact shakes Ria loose. Ria rolls off the roof, her cybernetic claws tearing strips of metal as she falls. She tumbles onto the highway, skidding in a shower of sparks, but she doesn't break. She stands up instantly, watching the car disappear into the tunnel.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica is shaking. She almost killed them all to save Zephyr. She realizes that she values her "entourage" more than her safety. This vulnerability—her love for her friends—is both her weakness and her strength.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She prioritizes loyalty over logic. She saves the rogue.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (watching them leave):** "This isn't over! You can't outrun the Vanguard!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Are you okay?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "She... she was going to snap my neck. Thanks, Princess. You drive like a maniac."
