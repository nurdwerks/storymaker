# Character Profile: Dr. Hale (The Skeptical Healer)

**Archetype:** The Skeptical Healer / The Protector of the Past
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He believes he is the only one who can "save" Torin from the hallucinations of the future).
**Virtue Mask:** CARE (He frames his dismissal of others as "Patient Health and Safety").

## I. Role in the Story

Dr. Hale is the ship’s doctor on the original Generation Ship. He manages Torin’s stress and represents the skepticism of a world that doesn't yet believe in "magic."

- **The Erasure:** He treats Angelica as a "hallucination" or a symptom of Torin’s fatigue.
- **The Warning:** "Leave him alone, phantom. He needs rest."

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** **The Frost-Plague.** **Location:** Book 6, Chapter 17 ("The Cure"). A harsh winter brings a deadly virus to the North Colony. Hale’s medicines fail. He watches patients die by the dozens, including Ragnar. He realizes his science is powerless against the "Entropy" of the changing world.
- **Impact on Torin:** Torin realizes that his "Protector" is powerless. This leads to a breakdown of his mental state, as he realizes that even the "Past" cannot save them from the horrors of the "Future." He begins to trust Angelica's "magic" more than Hale's science.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Healer" becomes a skeptic. Hale stops treating his patients as "boys" and starts seeing them as "inventory," turning the medical bay into a place of sterile, transactional survival.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 7 | Chapter 07 | Detailed Description | The doors slide open, admitting a stream of walking wounded. Broken noses, trampled hands, panic attacks, bruises from being crushed against bulkheads. Corinne, having quelled the riot in the Mess Hall, follows them here. She finds the medical staff overwhelmed. Dr. Hale is trying to intubate a patient while three others scream for attention. Corinne immediately takes charge, not as a doctor, but as an administrator. She directs nurses, organizes triage lines, and bullies people into calmness. She uses Scrap as an enforcer to keep the lines orderly. |
