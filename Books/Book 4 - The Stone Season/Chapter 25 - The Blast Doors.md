## Chapter 25: The Blast Doors

### Scene 1: The Descent / Ventilation Shaft 4-Alpha

- **Key Event:** The air grows colder as they descend. The hum of the ship's circulation fans—usually a distant thrum—becomes a deafening roar. They are in the lungs of the _Zenith_ now.
- **Key Event:** The group is ragged. Angelica’s boots are held together with duct tape. Zephyr is limping, his cybernetic leg venting steam with every step. Dr. Aris checks his datapad every thirty seconds, the screen casting a pale blue pallor on his sweating face.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher brings up the rear. He walks backward, his massive revolver trained on the dark throat of the tunnel they just left. He doesn't look tired. He looks... resigned. He is chewing on his matchstick, the wood splintered between his teeth.
- **Key Event:** Aris stops at a heavy grate. "We're here. The sub-basement. Deepest level before the Foundation."
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Hatcher):** He can smell it. Not just the recycled air, but something copper and wrong. The scent of ozone and rot. The Blighted are close. He shifts the matchstick from the left side of his mouth to the right. A bad sign.
- **Key Event:** Aris bypasses the lock. The grate swings open. They drop down onto a metal catwalk suspended over an abyss of machinery.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "This is it. The biological vault. If we get in, we control the weather. We win."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** _(Checking his ammo count)_ "If we get in, we get cornered. This better work, Doc. I'm down to my last clip of incendiaries."

### Scene 2: The Heat / The Catwalk

- **Key Event:** They move across the catwalk. Below them, giant pistons churn in the dark, driving the ship's artificial gravity. The noise is a rhythmic, bone-shaking crash.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher freezes. He doesn't need a motion tracker. He feels the vibration in the soles of his shoes. A different rhythm. Faster. Scuttling.
- **Key Event:** He looks up at the mess of pipes and conduits above them. "Lights," he whispers. "Kill the lights."
- **Key Event:** Angelica doesn't argue. She smashes the lumen-strip on the wall with the butt of her rifle. Darkness slams down on them.
- **Key Event:** In the dark, the heat signatures of the Blighted flare like stars in Hatcher's vision—no, wait, he's a Null. He doesn't see resonance. He hears them. The clicking of claws on metal. The wet, rasping breath of things that shouldn't have throats.
- **Key Event:** A red emergency light spins in the distance, cutting slices through the gloom. In the flashes, they see the Horde. Hundreds of them. They are crawling down the ventilation shafts like oil, a mass of twisted limbs and glowing eyes.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "The whole damn ant hill is coming. They must have tracked our heat signatures all the way down."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Run."

### Scene 3: The Jam / The Blast Doors

- **Key Event:** They sprint. The metal grating clangs under their boots. Behind them, the shriek of the Horde rises, a chorus of starving metal and meat.
- **Key Event:** They reach the end of the catwalk. The Blast Doors. Huge. Titanium-reinforced. Stenciled with the faded logo of **PROJECT NOAH**.
- **Key Event:** Aris jams his interface jack into the port. His hands are shaking so bad he misses the slot twice. "Come on... come on..."
- **Key Event:** The console lights up amber. **lockdown initiated. biocontainment protocol active.**
- **Key Event:** "It's locked down!" Aris screams. "The system thinks we're the infection!"
- **Key Event:** Hatcher turns. He raises the Widowmaker. He fires. _BOOM._ The recoil travels up his arm, familiar and comforting. A Blighted creature—something that used to be a maintenance worker—explodes in mid-air, knocked back by the heavy slug.
- **Key Event:** "Override it!" Angelica shouts, firing pulses of energy into the swarm.
- **Key Event:** Aris types furiously. Hydraulics groan. The massive doors shudder. They begin to part.
- **Key Event:** _CRUNCH._ The doors stop. A two-foot gap. Just enough for a person to squeeze through sideways.
- **Key Event:** "Hydraulic failure," Aris gasps. "The pistons are seized. That's as far as it goes."
- **Key Event:** The Horde is fifty yards away. The bridge is shaking under their weight.

### Scene 4: The Squeeze / The Threshold

- **Key Event:** "Go!" Hatcher barks. He grabs Aris by the collar and throws him through the gap. Aris tumbles into the dark lab beyond.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr goes next, dragging his bad leg. He curses as his armor scrapes against the metal.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is firing, covering the retreat. She backs up to the door. "Hatcher! Move!"
- **Key Event:** Hatcher looks at the gap. Then he looks at the manual override wheel on the wall. A heavy, rusted iron crank.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Hatcher):** He does the math. The door is stuck. The hydraulics are dead. If they don't close it, the Horde will pour through that gap like water. The only way to close it is the manual crank. On the outside.
- **Key Event:** He looks at Angelica. He sees the fire in her veins. He sees the desperation. She is the future. She is the hope he gave up on twenty years ago.
- **Key Event:** He isn't. He's just a tired old cop with a ghost in his head.
- **Key Event:** He shoves Angelica through the gap. She stumbles back, catching herself. She turns, reaching for him. "Hatcher, grab my hand!"
- **Key Event:** Hatcher steps back. He grabs the manual crank with both hands. His muscles cord with strain. He grunts, pulling the wheel.
- **Key Event:** The gears scream. The door inches shut.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He smiles. It’s a real smile. Not the cynical smirk. Not the weary grimace. It reaches his eyes. He looks lighter, as if the gravity finally let go of him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Go find the truth, Princess. And burn it down. Burn it all down."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** _(From inside)_ "Don't be a hero! You told me that!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "I'm retired anyway. Put it on my tab."

### Scene 5: The Solo / The Catwalk

- **Key Event:** The door slams shut. The lock engages with a final, heavy clank.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher is alone on the catwalk. The emergency light spins. Red. Black. Red. Black.
- **Key Event:** The Horde slows down. They sense the prey is trapped. They fan out, hundreds of glowing eyes staring at the lone man in the trench coat.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher sighs. The _Null Sigh_. Long and rattling. He drops the spent casing from his revolver. He doesn't reload.
- **Key Event:** He holsters the gun. He reaches around his back and unclips the case.
- **Key Event:** He takes out the saxophone. The brass is dented, dull in the red light. He licks the reed. He adjusts the mouthpiece.
- **Key Event:** The Blighted crouch, confused. They expect fire. They expect screaming.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher closes his eyes. He blows.
- **Key Event:** The sound tears through the recycled air. A low, mournful wail that climbs into a chaotic, screaming jazz run. It is discordant. It is angry. It is alive.
- **Key Event:** The Horde shrieks in response, enraged by the noise. They charge. A wall of teeth and claws.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher doesn't stop playing. He plays faster, his fingers flying over the keys. He pours every regret, every failure, every drink, every memory of Elena into the horn. He plays the soundtrack to his own end.
- **Key Event:** They are on him.
- **Key Event:** His hand drops from the sax to his belt. He pulls the pin on the cluster of grenades he’s been saving since Book 2.
- **Key Event:** **"Encore,"** he whispers.

### Scene 6: The Silence / The Lab

- **Key Event:** Inside the lab, the explosion is a dull _thud_. The heavy doors vibrate, dust falling from the frame.
- **Key Event:** Then, silence.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands staring at the sealed metal. The echo of the blast fades, leaving only the sound of their own breathing.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr punches the wall, a rare display of raw emotion. "Damn it, old man. Damn it."
- **Key Event:** Angelica touches the cold metal of the door. She doesn't cry. Hatcher wouldn't want that. She just tightens her grip on her rifle.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** The door closes. The hero stays outside. That is the rule. And now, she has a debt to pay.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We keep moving. We don't waste the time he bought us."
