## Chapter 04: Vane's Lab

### Scene 1: Med-Bay / The "Factory"

- **Key Event:** Angelica enters Vane's improvised laboratory in the Med-Bay.
- **Detailed Description:** The Med-Bay, once a pristine white environment dedicated to healing, has been transformed into a charnel house of experimental science. The air filters struggle to scrub the metallic tang of blood and the ozone smell of high-voltage lasers. Vane has requisitioned the surgical suites for his own purposes. Rows of stasis tanks line the walls, each containing a writhing, semi-organic mass suspended in green nutrient fluid. In the center of the room, a "Brood Queen"—a massive cluster of Nano-Swarm bots harvested from a dead Warden—hovers in a magnetic containment field. It pulses with a hive-mind intelligence, shifting shape constantly. Vane stands before it, wearing a butcher's apron over his ceremonial robes, his hands stained with fluids that are not entirely human. He works with the manic energy of a man who believes he is saving the world by breaking it.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels nauseous. She remembers the purity of her father's lab, the respect for life. This is a perversion of science. But she forces herself to walk forward. She needs Vane's resources. She hates that she needs him. She clenches her fists to stop them from shaking.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He doesn't turn when she enters. He is dissecting a live sample of the swarm, fascinated by its regenerative properties. He treats the living tissue like clay. He is utterly detached from the suffering he causes.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Ah, the prodigal daughter. Come to see the future? It's a bit messy, I'm afraid. Birth always is. Look at this regeneration rate! It defies entropy!"

- **Key Event:** Vane demonstrates the "enhancements."
- **Detailed Description:** He leads her to a recovery ward. Lying on the beds are refugees—volunteers, Vane claims, though their eyes are glazed with heavy sedatives. Their limbs have been replaced with crude cybernetics grafted directly onto the bone without anesthesia, using the Nano-Swarm to force rapid healing. Their skin is turning gray, hardening into a chitinous armor. They are becoming "Husks," durable biological tanks capable of surviving in the vacuum. One subject twitches, his new mechanical arm crushing the bed rail.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica looks at a young man whose arm has been replaced by a plasma caster. She sees the pain etched on his sleeping face. She wants to shut it down. She wants to burn the lab. But then she thinks of the alien fleet hunting them. She thinks of the "Needle-Ships" that can pierce their hull like paper. She realizes that normal humans can't fight this war. They need monsters.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You're making monsters, Vane. These were people. You're stripping them of their humanity."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Humanity is what got us into this mess. It is soft. It is weak. It dies in the cold. I am giving them a coat. A very thick, very durable coat. They will thank me when the air runs out. Would you rather they die as humans or live as weapons?"

### Scene 2: The Brood Queen

- **Key Event:** The Brood Queen attempts to breach containment.
- **Detailed Description:** The swarm cluster in the center of the room surges. It senses the fear in the room. It forms a face—a rough approximation of Vane's own face—against the containment field. It screams electronically, a sound of thousand microscopic voices. The field flickers. Sparks fly from the generators. Vane laughs, adjusting the voltage to "punish" the entity. He treats it like a disobedient pet.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica realizes Vane isn't just using the tech; he is enslaving a sentient hive mind. He is playing god with a species he doesn't understand. She wonders if the swarm will eventually break free and consume the ship.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She steps back, her hand on her weapon. She decides not to interfere. It is a moment of supreme moral compromise. She accepts the horror because it buys them time. She hates herself for it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are the Messiah, Angelica. You offer them salvation. But I am the Evolution. I offer them survival. We need both. You pray, I cut."

### Scene 3: The Departure

- **Key Event:** Angelica leaves the lab.
- **Detailed Description:** She walks out of the Med-Bay. The door slides shut, cutting off the screams of the machinery. She leans against the wall in the clean corridor, breathing heavily. She feels dirty.
- **Internal Conflict:** She realizes that Vane is right. They need the Husks. But she swears that once the war is over, she will dismantle his lab and put him on trial. If they survive.
