## Chapter 15: The Escape

### Scene 1: The Shot / Ventilation Shaft 12-B, Museum of Pre-History

- **Key Event:** Hatcher lies prone in the narrow metal duct. It smells of dust and ancient desiccated grease. Through the grate, he sees the Gallery below. It is a slaughterhouse of light and shadow.
- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane stands in the center of the room, surrounded by a swirling cloud of nano-filaments. They shimmer like liquid mercury, deflecting every bolt Angelica fires. He isn't even moving his hands. He is just _existing_, and the air warps around him.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher steadies his breathing. He shifts the matchstick to the right side of his mouth.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Hatcher):** He can't kill Vane. The Widowmaker is a cannon, but Vane is a natural disaster. The nano-shield would eat the bullet before it scratched the paint. Hatcher needs to change the equation.
- **Key Event:** He looks up. Above Vane hangs the "Star of Babylon," a massive, six-ton crystal chandelier from the Old World. It is held up by a gravity-suspensor unit.
- **Key Event:** "Gravity always wins," Hatcher whispers.
- **Key Event:** He exhales—the _Null Sigh_. He squeezes the trigger.
- **Key Event:** The gun roars in the confined space, deafening him. The heavy slug flies true, not at Vane, but at the fragile glass node of the suspensor.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He demonstrates tactical wisdom by targeting a structural weakness to bypass Vane’s advanced nano-defenses rather than attempting a direct kill.

### Scene 2: The Crash / The Gallery

- **Key Event:** The suspensor shatters. The hum of anti-gravity dies instantly.
- **Key Event:** For a heartbeat, there is silence. Then, six tons of crystal and steel plummet.
- **Key Event:** The impact feels like a bomb. The floor buckles. Dust and shards of glass explode outward like shrapnel.
- **Key Event:** Vane’s passive defenses react instantly. The nano-swarm constricts, forming a solid silver dome over his head to catch the falling mountain. It holds—but it takes _all_ of his focus. The pressure wave knocks him to one knee.
- **Key Event:** The shockwave throws Angelica across the room. She hits a display case, shattering the glass. Her ears are ringing. Her vision is swimming in red.
- **Key Event:** She spots Zephyr. He is unconscious, half-buried under a pile of velvet ropes and debris.
- **Key Event:** She crawls towards him. Her leg drags. She tastes copper—blood from a bitten tongue.
- **Key Event:** She grabs Zephyr by his combat harness. He is dead weight. "Wake up, Zephyr, damn you! We're dead if we stay!"
- **Key Event:** She heaves him up. Her muscles scream. She can hear the whine of Vane’s swarm re-orienting. He won't be pinned for long.

### Scene 3: The Burn / Security Room

- **Key Event:** In the security sub-basement, Lisbet is plugged into the mainframe. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only the whites.
- **Key Event:** The Museum's security grid is military-grade. It is trying to lock the exits, sealing the gallery to create a kill box.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet screams. It is a silent, digital scream in the Net. She sees the code as walls of fire closing in.
- **Key Event:** She has no time for finesse. She has no time for a hack. She needs a brute-force breach.
- **Key Event:** She grabs the live power conduit of the server bank in the digital space. She channels the raw voltage through her own neural link.
- **Key Event:** In the real world, her body arches. Sparks shower from her interface port. Smoke curls from her ears. The smell of burning hair fills the small room.
- **Key Event:** The surge hits the grid. The blast doors in the gallery groan and slide open, their electronic locks fried.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet slumps forward, convulsing. Her datapad smokes.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She risks permanent neural damage and severe physical injury by acting as a living circuit to ensure the team's escape path is clear.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** _(Static-filled voice over comms)_ "GO! GO NOW!"

### Scene 4: The Run / The Bridge of History

- **Key Event:** Angelica drags Zephyr through the open blast doors. They stumble out onto the Bridge of History, a glass walkway spanning the museum's atrium.
- **Key Event:** Behind them, the dust cloud in the gallery swirls. Vane steps out of the debris. He is untouched. Not a speck of dust on his white robes. He walks calmly, stepping over the shattered crystal.
- **Key Event:** "Run," Angelica chokes out. They limp across the bridge.
- **Key Event:** Ahead, the glass wall of the atrium shatters inward.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher's battered hover-car—a rust-bucket sedan with one working thruster—smashes through the window. It drifts sideways, screeching across the polished floor, knocking over a priceless statue of a pre-war General.
- **Key Event:** The passenger door flies open. "Get in!" Hatcher roars, leaning over the seat.
- **Key Event:** Angelica throws Zephyr into the back seat and dives into the front.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher slams the throttle. The car spins, its repulsors whining in protest, and shoots back out the broken window into the rainy night.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks back.
- **Key Event:** Vane stands at the edge of the shattered window. The wind whips his robes. He isn't firing. He isn't pursuing. He is watching.
- **Key Event:** He raises a hand, not in attack, but in a mocking salute. He smiles. It is a cold, clinical smile.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She shivers. It isn't the cold air rushing into the cabin. It's the realization. He let them go. He has seen what she can do. He has measured her resonance. To him, this wasn't a battle. It was a field test.
- **Key Event:** And she passed.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes that Vane’s psychological victory is as dangerous as his physical one, as he now has her blood and knows her ultimate goals.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "He's already won the first round. And he wants us to know it."
