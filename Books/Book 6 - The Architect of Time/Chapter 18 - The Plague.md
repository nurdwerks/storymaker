## Chapter 18: The Plague

### Scene 1: The Sickness / The Village

- **Key Event:** It starts with a cough. Dry. Racking.
- **Key Event:** Then the fever. High. Delirium.
- **Key Event:** Within a week, half the tribe is down. The work on the ship stops.
- **Key Event:** It isn't a normal flu. It hits fast and hard.
- **Key Event:** Angelica walks through the sick tents. The sound of wheezing fills the air.
- **Key Event:** She recognizes the symptoms. The blue tinge to the lips. The rapid onset.
- **Key Event:** "It's the Delta-Strain," she realizes with horror. "From the 22nd Century. It shouldn't exist yet."
- **Key Event:** Then she looks in a mirror. She sees her own pale face.
- **Key Event:** "Me," she whispers. "I brought it. It was dormant in my blood. My immune system is adapted. Theirs isn't."
- **Key Event:** She is Patient Zero. She is the carrier.
- **Key Event:** Guilt crashes over her. She came to save them, and she is killing them.

### Scene 2: The Cure / The Cave Lab

- **Key Event:** Ragnar is dying. The Alpha lies on his furs, shivering, his mighty strength gone.
- **Key Event:** "Save him," Torin begs Angelica. "If he dies, the tribe scatters."
- **Key Event:** Angelica runs to her lab. She tears through her supplies. Nothing advanced enough.
- **Key Event:** She needs an antibiotic. But she is five thousand years too early for CVS.
- **Key Event:** She looks at a pile of old food she forgot to throw out.
- **Key Event:** A loaf of bread. Green and fuzzy.
- **Key Event:** She stares at it. "Mold."
- **Key Event:** She grabs it. She smells it. Earthy.
- **Key Event:** _Penicillium notatum._
- **Key Event:** "Thank you, Fleming," she mutters.
- **Key Event:** She works feverishly. Crushing the mold. Filtering it through cloth. Mixing it with sterile water.
- **Key Event:** It is crude. It is dirty. It is science.
- **Key Event:** "I am cheating death with a sandwich," she says, holding up a vial of cloudy liquid.

### Scene 3: The Result / The Alpha's Tent

- **Key Event:** She rushes back to Ragnar.
- **Key Event:** The Old Seer is there, shaking a rattle over him.
- **Key Event:** "Get out," Angelica snaps.
- **Key Event:** "He is cursed!" the Seer shrieks.
- **Key Event:** Angelica ignores him. She finds a vein in Ragnar's arm.
- **Key Event:** She uses a hollow reed with a sharpened fish bone as a needle.
- **Key Event:** She injects the fluid.
- **Key Event:** "Die or live," she whispers. "Just don't stay sick."
- **Key Event:** She waits. Torin waits.
- **Key Event:** Hours pass.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar's breathing evens out. The sweat breaks. Cool skin.
- **Key Event:** He opens his eyes.
- **Key Event:** "I am hungry," he croaks.

### Scene 4: The Witch / The Village Square

- **Key Event:** News spreads. The Sky-Witch cured the Alpha.
- **Key Event:** Lines form at her lab.
- **Key Event:** She works night and day, growing mold, filtering, injecting.
- **Key Event:** People fall to their knees when she passes. They try to kiss her boots.
- **Key Event:** "Stop it!" she yells, pulling her foot away. "I'm not a god!"
- **Key Event:** She holds up a piece of moldy bread.
- **Key Event:** "Don't worship me. Worship the fungus. I am fighting death with a sandwich crust."
- **Key Event:** They don't listen. They see magic. She sees biology. But the result is the same. Life.

### Scene 5: The Exposed Prophet / The Cliff

- **Key Event:** Ragnar stands before the tribe. He is weak, but standing.
- **Key Event:** He points a shaking finger at the Old Seer.
- **Key Event:** "You rattled bones while my people died," Ragnar says.
- **Key Event:** He motions to the Seer's hut. "Search it."
- **Key Event:** Warriors drag out sacks of grain. Dried meat. Hoarded while the tribe starved.
- **Key Event:** The tribe roars in anger.
- **Key Event:** "He fed himself on your fear," Ragnar says.
- **Key Event:** He looks at Angelica. "She fed us with her wisdom."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar points to the jungle.
- **Key Event:** "Go," he tells the Seer. "Take your bones. If the spirits love you, they will feed you."
- **Key Event:** The Seer is dragged away, screaming curses.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar turns to Angelica.
- **Key Event:** He bows. Low.
- **Key Event:** "The Old Ways are dead," he says. "We follow the New Way. We follow the Architect."
- **Key Event:** Angelica shivers. She has won their loyalty. But she has also destroyed their culture. The price of progress.
