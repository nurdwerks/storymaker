## Chapter 1: The Scavenger's Prince

### Scene 1: The Descent

- **Key Event:** The setting.
- **Detailed Description:** Sector 12, known colloquially as "The Undercity" or "The Silt," is a graveyard of technology. It is a sprawling, subterranean slum built into the rusted foundations of the Zenith Spire. The air is thick with smog, ozone, and the smell of frying electronics. Angelica Ward (age 17) hangs from a grease-slicked suspension cable at Node 42—the primary waste disposal junction for the Upper City. She is wearing a mishmash of scavenged gear: heavy magnetic boots, a leather flight jacket patches with duct tape, and a pair of modified welding goggles. Below her, the "River"—a conveyor belt of trash—roars like a dying beast.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Angelica calculates the drop. 40 feet. The conveyor is moving at 15 miles per hour. If she misses, the shredders at the end of the line will turn her into mulch.

- **Key Event:** The hunt.
- **Detailed Description:** A pneumatic tube overhead hisses. A canister from the Zenith shoots out, tumbling through the air. It's a "Blue bin"—medical tech. Angelica kicks off the wall, swinging out over the abyss. She times her release perfectly. She drops, landing on the moving trash pile with a heavy metallic _thud_. She stabilizes herself, ignoring the stench of rotting synthetic food.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Come on... give me something good. Don't be diapers. Please don't be diapers."

- **Key Event:** The find.
- **Detailed Description:** She tears open the canister. Inside, amidst the packing foam, is a smashed Medical Drone (Model 7-Alpha). It's sleek, white, and ceramic—completely out of place in the filth. Its chassis is cracked, and one rotor arm is sheared off. Someone upstairs threw it away because it was "broken."

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Demonstrates her philosophy. To the Zenith, a scratch is garbage. To her, it's an opportunity. She caresses the broken machine with reverence. She doesn't see trash; she sees components. She sees rent money. She sees survival.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Look at you. Too pretty for the drop? Did you scratch the paint? Is that why they flushed you? Their loss, darling. You're coming home with me."

- **Key Event:** The extraction.
- **Detailed Description:** She straps the 40-pound drone to her back, securing it with bungee cords. The weight is crushing, but she grins. This unit alone is worth six months of rations.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Shows cold, calcified contempt for the wasteful Zenith elite. They throw away miracles while people down here fight for scraps.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You better be worth the calories. If you're fried, I'm turning you into a toaster."

### Scene 2: The Workshop

- **Key Event:** The return.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica navigates the labyrinth of the Undercity. She moves through "The Warrens," climbing ladders, sliding down chutes, and dodging the patrolling gangs of "Rust-Eaters." She reaches her home—a hidden crawlspace inside a repurposed ventilation hub behind a massive, dormant intake fan. It is cramped, filled with tools, wires, and half-built machines. It hums with the sound of stolen electricity.

- **Key Event:** The repair.
- **Detailed Description:** She lays the drone on her workbench—an overturned crate. She puts on her "spectacles"—a headset with magnifying lenses she built herself. She fires up a soldering iron. For the next three hours, she works. She bypasses the damaged logic core, rerouting the power through a sensory chip she scavenged from a toy dog. She welds the chassis with steady, grease-stained hands.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Takes pride in her work. She believes she understands machines better than the Zenith engineers who created them. They only know how to assemble; she knows how to _survive_.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't fight me. I know your motherboard is fried. I'm giving you a bypass. It'll itch, but you'll live. Wakey wakey."

- **Key Event:** The resurrection.
- **Detailed Description:** The drone shudders. Its single ocular eye flickers red, then stabilizes to a calm blue. It lifts off the table, hovering unsteadily on its remaining engines. It scans the room, confused by the grime.
  - _Drone Voice:_ "System Reboot. Location unknown. Please return unit to Sector 1 Medical Bay immediately. Unauthorized handling is a Class B felony."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Sweetheart, you're about three miles and two tax brackets away from Sector 1. You belong to House Ward now. And around here, we don't call the cops. We improvise."

### Scene 3: The Reality Check

- **Key Event:** The sound.
- **Detailed Description:** The triumph of the repair is cut short. From behind a curtain of heavy plastic sheeting, a sound emerges. A cough. It starts dry, then turns wet, fluid-filled, and rattling. It is the sound of lungs turning to stone.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her "Prince" persona—the confident, swaggering scavenger—vanishes in an instant. She drops her tools. Her face goes pale. She is just a terrified sister now.

- **Key Event:** The patient.
- **Detailed Description:** She pulls back the curtain. Leo Ward (age 10) lies on a cot. He is small, frail, his skin translucent. His chest heaves with every breath. He is clutching a battered plush rabbit. The air in the room is filtered, but it's not enough. The Silt gets everywhere.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo Ward:** (Weakly) "Angie? Is that you?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm here, Leo. I'm back. And look... I brought a friend. I found a doctor."

- **Key Event:** The diagnosis.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica commands the drone to scan him. "Scan subject: Leo Ward. Priority One." The drone floats over the boy. A blue laser grid maps his chest. It beeps—a harsh, dissonant sound.

  - _Drone Voice:_ "Diagnosis: Acute Particulate Fibrosis. Stage 4. 'The Under-Lung.' Vital capacity at 30%. Immediate treatment required."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Treatment options. List them."
  - _Drone Voice:_ "Option 1: Genetic Resequencing (Unavailable). Option 2: Grade-A Steroid Inhaler and Cellular Scrubbers. Administer immediately."

- **Key Event:** The helplessness.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica checks their supply cache. It's empty. Just a few empty inhaler canisters and some dirty bandages.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo Ward:** "It's okay, Angie. I'm not hungry anyway. My chest just hurts a little."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering) "It's not okay. It's not going to be okay. But I'm going to fix it."

### Scene 4: The Decision

- **Key Event:** The realization.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica sits back, staring at the drone. It is a marvel of technology, but it is useless. It can diagnose, but it cannot heal. It is a box of sensors with no medicine. She realizes that scavenging isn't enough anymore. Picking through the trash won't save Leo. She needs the real thing. She needs to go to the source.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her pride turns into cold, hard anger. Anger at the Zenith. Anger at the unfairness. Anger at a world where medicine is thrown away while children die.

- **Key Event:** The interrogation.
- **Detailed Description:** She grabs the drone. She brandishes a sonic-screwdriver (a hyper-spanner). She points it at the drone's logic core.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You have access codes. For the Medical Grid. For the dispensaries in Sector 1."
  - _Drone Voice:_ "Access Restricted. Authorization required."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "My authorization is that I have a screwdriver and you have an off switch. Unlock the grid coordinates. Show me where the good stuff is. Now."

- **Key Event:** The promise.
- **Detailed Description:** The drone complies, projecting a holographic map of the Upper City. Angelica studies it, memorizing the patrol routes and the ventilation shafts. She puts on her jacket. She grabs her Haptic Glove. She leans down and kisses Leo on the forehead.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I have to go out for a bit. Just a quick run. I'm going to get you the good medicine. The stuff the rich kids use."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo Ward:** "Come back?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Always. I promise. I will buy the sky for you, Leo. I'll bring it down here and wrap it around you."

### Scene 5: The Quote

- **Key Event:** The ascent.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica exits the workshop. She climbs the maintenance ladder, heading up towards the mid-levels. The drone follows her, hovering at her shoulder.

  - _Drone Voice:_ "Warning. Leaving designated zone. Trespassing in automated sectors is dangerous."

- **Key Event:** The Image of Authority.
- **Detailed Description:** As looking up at the Spire, a massive holographic projection flickers to life against the smog. It is **The Emperor**, his golden mask flawless, his eyes benevolent and cold. The projection loops a silent benediction, his hands raised as if shielding the city from the sky he despises.
- **Key Event:** The philosophy.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica pauses at a rusted hatch. She stares at the hologram.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Articulates her worldview. She is not a mechanic who restores things to their original state; she is a re-creator. She fixes things by breaking them in new ways.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Nice mask, old man. But we all know there's just wires underneath."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I don't fix things to make them work, metal-head. I fix things to prove they're broken. And this whole city? It's broken. It's running on bad code."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let's go void the warranty. Let's show them what a couple of rats can do to their shiny machine."
