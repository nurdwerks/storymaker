## Chapter 22: The Children

### Scene 1: The Legacy / The River Grove

- **Key Event:** It is a sunny afternoon. The roar of the construction site is distant here.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sits on a mossy rock.
- **Key Event:** Twelve children sit in a semi-circle around her. They range from six to sixteen.
- **Key Event:** They are the "Children of the Sky." The first generation raised not on superstition, but on science.
- **Key Event:** They hold slate tablets and chalk.
- **Key Event:** "What holds the ship together?" Angelica asks.
- **Key Event:** "Rivets!" a young boy shouts.
- **Key Event:** "Welds!" a girl corrects.
- **Key Event:** Angelica shakes her head. "Those hold the metal. What holds the _ship_?"
- **Key Event:** Elara, the oldest, raises her hand. "Truth," she says.
- **Key Event:** Angelica nods. "Explain."
- **Key Event:** "If the math is wrong, the beam falls," Elara recites. "If the steel is flawed, the hull breaches. The universe punishes lies."
- **Key Event:** "Exactly," Angelica says. "We build with truth. If we lie to the steel, the ship breaks. If we lie to ourselves, we break. Ethics is just engineering applied to the soul."

### Scene 2: The Teaching / The Gyro-Lab including

- **Key Event:** Angelica takes them to the Gyro-Lab—a hut filled with spinning tops and pendulums.
- **Key Event:** "Elara, the stabilizer is drifting," Angelica says, pointing to a massive, spinning flywheel.
- **Key Event:** Elara steps forward. She is nervous.
- **Key Event:** The wheel is humming, wobbling slightly.
- **Key Event:** "Don't fight it," Angelica instructs. "It's heavy. You can't force it. Listen to it."
- **Key Event:** Elara closes her eyes. She puts her hand near the bearing. She feels the vibration.
- **Key Event:** She gently taps the counter-weight. Once. Twice.
- **Key Event:** The wobble vanishes. The hum becomes a pure, steady tone.
- **Key Event:** Elara opens her eyes, smiling.
- **Key Event:** "You felt the rhythm," Angelica says. "Physics is nature, Elara. It is the language the universe uses to speak to us. You just learned how to listen."

### Scene 3: The Realization / The Overlook

- **Key Event:** Class is dismissed. The children run off, laughing, tossing their tablets.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches them go.
- **Key Event:** She feels a strange ache in her chest. She never had children of her own. She never will.
- **Key Event:** But these minds... she shaped them.
- **Key Event:** She looks at Elara, who is explaining torque to a younger sibling using a stick and a rock.
- **Key Event:** "My DNA ends with me," Angelica thinks. "I will leave no bloodline. But my ideas... the Scientific Method, the thirst for truth... it lives in them."
- **Key Event:** She leans against a tree.
- **Key Event:** "That is a better immortality," she decides. "Flesh rots. Ideas infect."
- **Key Event:** She realizes she has become a mother after all. A mother of a civilization.

### Scene 4: The Promise / The Construct

- **Key Event:** Elara runs back to her. "Teacher? Are you coming?"
- **Key Event:** "In a minute," Angelica says.
- **Key Event:** "Are we really going to the stars?" Elara asks. "Like in the stories?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the massive skeleton of the _Aeterna_ rising above the trees.
- **Key Event:** "Yes," she says.
- **Key Event:** "Will you be there?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica hesitates. She knows the risks of the first jump. The chronal shear. She is old. Her heart is weak.
- **Key Event:** "I will take you to the door," she promises, brushing Elara's hair back. "I will unlock it. I will open it wide."
- **Key Event:** "But will you walk through it with us?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica kisses her forehead.
- **Key Event:** "I will take you to the door," she repeats. "But you must walk through it."
- **Key Event:** Elara nods, satisfied. She runs off.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches her until she disappears. "Because I might be the doorstop," she whispers to the empty air.
