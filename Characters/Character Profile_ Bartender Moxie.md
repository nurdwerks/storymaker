# Character Profile: Bartender Moxie

**Archetype:** The Underworld Matriarch / The Keeper of Secrets
**True Sin:** GLUTTONY (Of gossip, influence, and the easy life of the bar).
**Virtue Mask:** HOSPITALITY (She only welcomes "Her Own").

## I. Role in the Story

Moxie is the tough owner of "The Last Drop" who treats Zephyr like a favorite son. She represents the "family" that Zephyr found in the underworld—a family built on shared sins and free drinks.

- **The Interaction:** She slides Zephyr a free drink the moment he walks in, greeting him with a "handsome," while glaring at Angelica.
- **The Question:** "Who's the stiff? She paying?" Her dismissal of Angelica as a "stiff" reinforces the protagonist's status as a humorless "Zenith tourist" who doesn't belong.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Underworld Raid / Loss of Sanctuary. **Location:** Book 2, Chapter 28 ("The Last Drop"). Zenith Wardens raid "The Last Drop." Moxie is forced to burn the bar to the ground to destroy the data stored in the basement, losing her livelihood and her "throne" to save her patrons.
  **Quote:** _"Closing time!"_
- **Impact on Zephyr:** Zephyr loses his "home." Seeing Moxie standing amidst the ashes of her life makes him realize that his "charming" underworld lifestyle has a very real, very ugly cost. He becomes more serious and focused on the revolution.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Sanctuary" is gone. The smugglers and low-lifes who called the bar home are scattered, turning Zephyr’s close-knit "family" into a group of desperate individuals fighting for scraps in the Silt.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 2 | Chapter 28 | Key Event | Wardens storm the "Last Drop" bar; Moxie sets the establishment on fire to distract the soldiers and allow her patrons to escape through the back. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 28 | Moment | **Moxie** — She shows heroic selflessness by burning the only home and business she has ever known to save the "rats" she cares for. |
