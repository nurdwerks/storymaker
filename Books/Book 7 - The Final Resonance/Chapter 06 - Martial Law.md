## Chapter 06: Martial Law

### Scene 1: The Vanguard Armory

- **Key Event:** Ria issues the ship-wide mobilization order.
- **Detailed Description:** The Armory is a hive of activity. Sirens blare in the background, a constant, rhythmic wail that sets the tempo for the deployment. Ria stands on a raised platform, overlooking the rows of "Iron Vanguard" troopers. These are not all professional soldiers; many are hastily armed crew, mechanics, and security droids, conscripted into service by the emergency. Ria authorizes the usage of "Level 5" munitions. These are kinetic heavy rounds, usually illegal inside a ship due to the risk of hull puncture. But with the enemy ignoring shields, she decides that physical force—sheer kinetic impact—is the only option. She unlocks the heavy weapon lockers, distributing railguns, suppression shields, and concussive grenades.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria feels a grim satisfaction. The waiting is over. The confusion of the "Noise" and the "Paintings" is replaced by the clarity of logistics. Ammo counts, fire zones, squad deployments—this is her language. She suppresses her fear of the unknown by drowning it in protocol. She knows that bullets might not kill a geometric anomaly, but they will make her feel like she is doing something.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She manually unlocks the weapon racks using her command key, her movements precise and forceful. She seems calmer now that there is a tangible enemy to shoot, or at least a tangible gun to hold.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Listen up! The rules of engagement are simple. If it moves, shoot it. If it doesn't move, shoot it until it does. We are the immune system now. We purge the infection."

### Scene 2: The Civilian Sectors

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron moves through the residential decks to enforce the lockdown.
- **Detailed Description:** The squad, led by Sergeant "Brick," moves through the narrow corridors of the civilian decks. They expect resistance to the harsh lockdown orders—people refusing to leave their homes or demanding answers. Instead, they find the corridors eerily quiet. The people—families, refugees from the "Stone Season," mechanics—are huddled in their quarters or gathered in the common areas, clinging to each other. Fear has done the job of enforcement for them. The air smells of stale recycled oxygen and anxiety.
- **Internal Conflict:** The troopers are uneasy. They are pointing guns at scared civilians who are looking to them for salvation, not suppression. The atmosphere is thick with dread. Brick keeps his finger off the trigger, his helmet hiding his own fear.

- **Key Event:** Power is cut to the civilian grid.
- **Detailed Description:** To reroute energy to the main cannons and shields, the bridge cuts power to non-essential sectors. The lights in the residential deck flicker and die, replaced instantly by the rotating red glare of emergency strobes. The sudden darkness causes a wave of panic. Children cry; adults shout questions at the troopers. The red light makes everyone look like bleeding ghosts, casting long, dancing shadows against the bulkheads.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Civilian Woman:** "Why are the lights gone? Vane said we were safe! He said it was a visitor! Why are you pointing guns at us?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Trooper:** "Vane isn't here, ma'am. I am. Get to the shelters. Now! Move!"

- **Key Event:** Ria authorizes the use of force to clear the corridors.
- **Detailed Description:** Seeing the crowd beginning to panic and block the tram lines needed for ammo transport, Ria (over comms) orders the use of sonic dispersal rounds. It is a harsh measure. The troopers fire warning shots of compressed sound. The "thump" of the sonic rounds vibrates in the chest, causing nausea and disorientation. The crowd scatters, stumbling into their designated shelters, hands over their ears.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria hates doing it. She knows she is terrifying the people she is sworn to protect. But she calculates that a terrified civilian in a room is safer than a calm one in the hallway when the geometry starts collapsing. She accepts the role of the villain to be the savior.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She watches the feed of the crying children and the fleeing families. She doesn't look away. She forces herself to witness the cost of her order.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Clear the lanes. I don't care if they hate us. I care if they survive."

### Scene 3: The Command Link

- **Key Event:** Ria attempts to link her tactical grid with the ship’s main defense cannons.
- **Detailed Description:** Back in the tactical center, Ria tries to slave the main batteries to her HUD. Access is denied. A red "admin lock" icon appears on her screen. Vane, from his locked spire, has firewalled the main guns. He is preventing them from firing on the "Visitor," treating the Entity as a guest rather than an invader.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria slams her fist into the console, cracking the plastic. She is fighting with one hand tied behind her back. Vane is actively sabotaging the defense. She feels a surge of murderous rage toward the Prelate. She imagines storming the spire and throwing him out the airlock.

- **Key Event:** Ria calls Lisbet for a workaround.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria contacts Lisbet in the server room. She demands a bypass. Lisbet works furiously, typing code to route the command signal through the waste-management subprocessors—a "back door" Vane wouldn't think to block because it's beneath his dignity. The screens around Lisbet glow with cascading green code.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She is sweating, her eyes darting across three screens. She is hacking her own ship, fighting the Captain's authority to save the Captain's life. She is the "Glitch" in Vane's perfect system.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "He's firewalled the main guns with a bio-metric lock. I'm bypassing... I'm routing through the garbage chutes... Got it. You have the stick, Ria."

- **Key Event:** Ria gains control of the point-defense turrets.
- **Detailed Description:** The lights on Ria's board turn green. She feels the vibration of the turrets tracking her eye movements via the neural link. The massive guns on the outer hull rotate, locking onto the coordinates she designates. She smiles, a cold, predatory expression. She now has the power to fight back. She is no longer just a soldier; she is the ship's trigger finger.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Thank you, Glitch. Now, let's make some noise."
