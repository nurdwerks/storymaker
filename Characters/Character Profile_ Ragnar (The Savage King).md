# Character Profile: Ragnar (The Savage King)

**Archetype:** The Barbarian / The Usurper / The Vessel **True Sin:** ENVY (A burning, corrosive jealousy of those who possess "The Sight" (Intellect/Magic). He hates Torin because Torin builds; Ragnar can only destroy. He hates Angelica because she is the magic he craves but cannot understand). **Virtue Mask:** FORTITUDE (He projects the image of the "Strong Man," the protector of tradition who rejects the "weak" ways of science and progress. He claims his brutality is necessary resilience against a harsh world).

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Primeval Man

Ragnar is the visual antithesis of the Zenith. If Kaelen is a scalpel and Ironwood is a piston, Ragnar is a jagged rock. He represents humanity before the Dome, before the genetic tampering—raw, hairy, and smelling of wet dog and iron.

### 1. The Mountain of Fur and Muscle

- **Stature:** He stands 6'5", a towering slab of organic muscle. Unlike the sculpted, gym-honed physiques of the Apex, Ragnar’s bulk is functional and layered with fat to survive the harsh winters of the Green World. He looks like a bear walking on two legs.

- **The Skin:** His skin is weather-beaten, tanned to the color of cured tobacco, and covered in a map of white scars from claws, axes, and fire. He paints his chest and face with **Blue Woad**—a plant-based dye mixed with ash. The patterns are not decorative; they mark the kills he has made.

- **Hair:** He wears his hair in a thick, matted mane, braided with copper rings and the teeth of wolves. His beard is a thicket that hides his mouth, often stained with wine or blood.

- **The Smell:** To Angelica, who is used to the sterile air of the Apex, Ragnar smells overwhelming. He smells of unwashed bodies, woodsmoke, rancid grease (used for insulation), and the metallic tang of dried blood. It is the scent of a predator.

### 2. The Digestion Toll (Physiological Toll)

Ragnar’s bond requires the sacrifice of **Digestion/Consumption**.

- **The Hunger:** He is perpetually starving. His metabolism runs at a fever pitch to support his bond. He eats constantly—raw meat, bones, roots.

- **The Teeth:** His teeth are filed to points, not for style, but because he gnaws on bones to extract marrow. His gums are black from the woad dye.

- **The Rot:** Because he consumes raw hearts to fuel his magic, he suffers from parasites and internal rot. He is strong on the outside, but dying on the inside. He coughs up black bile, which he hides from his clan to maintain the illusion of Fortitude.

### 3. The Possessed Look (Act II Transformation)

When the **Time-Wraith of Prelate Vane** possesses him in Book 6, Ragnar’s physiology changes terrifyingly.

- **The Posture:** The hunched, animalistic gait straightens. He begins to walk with Vane’s gliding, clinical smoothness, which looks wrong on a barbarian frame.

- **The Eyes:** His savage, brown eyes turn a milky, blind white (Vane’s ocular implant color), glowing with future-tech data streams that only he can see.

- **The Hands:** He stops using his axe like a club and starts using his fingers like scalpels, dissecting enemies with precision.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Ragnar wears his wealth and his kills.

- **The Furs:** He wears a cloak made from the pelt of a **Dire-Bear**. It is heavy, greasy, and provides armor against primitive weapons.

- **The Scavenged Metal:** Ragnar incorporates pieces of the "Sky Metal" (debris from the *Aeterna’s* initial landing pods) into his armor. He wears a pauldron made from a crushed thruster cone. He doesn't know what it is, only that it is harder than steel.

- **The Axe (Widow-Maker):** A massive, double-headed battle axe.

  - *The Material:* The head is forged from a piece of the ship’s hull plating. It is **Resonance-Conductive**, meaning it glows red when he channels his rage.

  - *The Haft:* Wrapped in human skin (rumored, but likely cured deer hide).

- **The Trophy Belt:** He wears a belt hung with the severed ears of rival chieftains. He strokes them when he is thinking.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Ragnar operates on the logic of "Crab Mentality." If he cannot climb, he pulls others down.

- **The Spit:** He spits constantly. It is a dominance display. He spits on the ground before he speaks, marking the earth as his.

- **Testing the Edge:** He uses his thumb to test the sharpness of his axe while people are talking to him. It is a subtle threat: *I am bored, and my weapon is sharp.*

- **Superstition as Control:** He labels anything he doesn't understand (Science, Math, Angelica’s tech) as "Witchcraft." He uses this label to incite fear in his followers. He knows that if they understand the tech, he loses his power, so he demonizes knowledge.

- **The Heart-Eater:** Before a battle, or when he needs to summon his Bond, he eats a raw heart. It is a ritualistic, gory display designed to terrify his enemies. He eats it in three bites, staring into the eyes of his opponent.

## IV. The Bond: Garm and The Cannibal Toll

Ragnar’s magic is the precursor to the Bond system of the future. It is raw, unfiltered, and dirty.

- **The Beast:** **Garm** (The Dire-Wolf).

  - **Appearance:** Garm is not mechanical. He is a massive, biological wolf the size of a pony. He is mangy, covered in scars, and foams at the mouth. His eyes burn with green witch-fire.

  - **Personality:** Savage loyalty. Garm is the alpha of the local wolf packs. He obeys Ragnar not out of love, but out of a magical dominance hierarchy.

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Manifestation:** **Primal Overt**. Ragnar summons the wolf from the forest shadows.

  - **The Link:** Ragnar gains the senses of the wolf. He can smell fear (literally). He has night vision.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Digestion (The Heart).**

  - *The Cost:* To maintain the psychic link and the physical enhancement (berserker strength), Ragnar must consume the **Vital Essence** of a living thing.

  - *The Specifics:* He must eat the heart of a creature (wolf, deer, or human) while it is still warm. The digestion of this organ releases the Resonance required to power the bond.

  - *The Horror:* This makes him a cannibal. He believes eating the heart of a rival absorbs their strength. It is a literalization of his Sin (Envy)—he wants to be them, so he eats them.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

**The Second Son:** Ragnar was the younger brother of the Clan Chief. **Torin** (Jamie) was the son of a rival clan. While Torin spent his youth studying the "Sky Metal" and learning math from the ancient archives, Ragnar spent his youth fighting in the mud.

**The Envy:** Ragnar hates Torin. Torin is weaker, slower, and refuses to fight with axes. Yet, the people listen to Torin. They respect his ability to build wells and fix plows. Ragnar sees Torin’s intellect as a cheat code. Ragnar believes that strength should rule, and Torin’s existence insults that worldview.

**The Rise:** Ragnar killed his own brother in a "hunting accident" to take control of the Clan. He rebranded the clan as **The Blood-Axe**, pivoting them from agriculture to raiding. He promised them that they didn't need to build; they could just take what Torin built.

**The Inciting Incident (Book 6):** When Angelica falls from the sky, Ragnar finds her first. He sees her clothes (zippers, synthetic fabric) and her devices. He knows instantly that she is like Torin—a creature of "Mind." His Envy spikes. He captures her, cages her, and plans to burn her as a witch to consolidate his power and destroy the "new ideas" she represents.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 6: The Architect of Time — ***The Savage***

- **State:** Ragnar is the Warlord of the Green World. He raids Torin’s construction site, stealing supplies and kidnapping workers.

- **The Capture:** He puts Angelica in a wooden cage. He pokes her with a spear. "Bleed, witch." He wants to see if she is mortal.

- **The Escape:** Torin rescues Angelica. Ragnar is humiliated. He swears vengeance.

- **The Sabotage:** Ragnar realizes he cannot beat Torin’s walls. He begins using biological warfare—poisoning the water supply with rotting carcasses. He wants to break their spirit.

### Book 6 (Act II) — ***The Vessel***

- **The Possession:** As Ragnar sleeps, dreaming of killing Torin, the **Time-Wraith of Prelate Vane** finds him. Vane needs a body. Ragnar is a hollow vessel of Envy, perfect for Vane’s Gluttony.

- **The Merge:** Vane enters Ragnar.

  - *The Change:* Ragnar wakes up. He stops scratching his fleas. He stands up straight. He looks at his axe and sneers, "Crude."

  - *The Upgrade:* Vane uses Ragnar’s body to build advanced weapons. He teaches the Blood-Axe clan how to refine gunpowder. He turns the barbarians into a disciplined army.

- **The Dynamic:** Ragnar is still "in there," screaming, but Vane is driving. Ragnar’s Envy is fed by Vane’s promise: "I will give you the power to crush the Architect."

### Book 6 (Act III) — ***The Boss Fight***

- **The Launch:** The Aliens arrive. Torin tries to launch the ship. Ragnar (Vane) leads an army to the launch pad.

- **The Motivation:** Vane wants to seize the ship to escape the timeline. Ragnar wants to kill Torin.

- **The Battle:** Angelica faces Ragnar. It is Magic vs. Anti-Magic.

  - *The Hybrid:* Ragnar uses **Garm** (The Wolf) combined with **Nano-Tech** that Vane synthesized from ship debris. The wolf has metal teeth. Ragnar moves with Vane’s speed and Ragnar’s strength.

- **The Climax:** Angelica fights him on the scaffolding. She realizes she cannot beat Vane’s mind or Ragnar’s body separately. She has to turn them against each other.

- **The Trick:** Angelica uses her **Imperial Voice** (Command Voice). She shouts, "**RAGNAR! KNEEL!**"

  - *The Reaction:* Ragnar’s primal instinct is to submit to an Alpha. Vane’s instinct is to rebel. The cognitive dissonance causes a seizure. Ragnar’s body locks up.

- **The Death:** Angelica uses the distraction to blast Ragnar off the scaffolding. He falls into the thruster pit.

- **The End:** As the engines ignite (triggered by Torin), Ragnar is incinerated. Vane’s spirit is ripped out and flung into the ship’s computer core, setting up the loop for Book 1. Ragnar dies screaming, not in pain, but in frustration that he lost to the "Witch" and the "Builder."

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Torin (The Shadow and The Light)

- **The Dynamic:** *Cain and Abel.*

- **The Friction:** Torin builds; Ragnar breaks. Torin looks up (at the stars); Ragnar looks down (at the mud).

- **The Envy:** Ragnar secretly wants to be Torin. He hoards Torin’s discarded blueprints in his tent, staring at them, trying to understand the lines. His violence is a tantrum of inadequacy.

### 2. With Angelica (The Prize and The Threat)

- **The Dynamic:** *Fear and Greed.*

- **The Shift:** Initially, he wants to kill her. Then, possessed by Vane, he wants to use her.

- **The Contrast:** Angelica represents the Future. Ragnar represents the Past. Their battle is thematic: Evolution vs. Stagnation.

### 3. With Prelate Vane (The Parasite)

- **The Dynamic:** *The Host.*

- **The Horror:** Vane treats Ragnar’s body like a rental car. He pushes the muscles to tear-point. He starves the body because he forgets to eat. Ragnar watches helplessly as his own hands build machines he hates.

- **The Irony:** Ragnar wanted power. Vane gave him power, but took his agency. Ragnar became the ultimate slave to his own Envy.

### 4. With Garm (The Beast)

- **The Dynamic:** *Cruelty.*

- **The Interaction:** Ragnar kicks the wolf. He starves it to make it mean.

- **The Twist:** When Vane takes over, he ignores the wolf. Garm becomes confused. In the final battle, Garm hesitates to defend Ragnar because he doesn't recognize the scent of the man inside. That hesitation allows Angelica to land the killing blow.

## VIII. Key Quotes & Internal Monologues

- *"You look at the sky and see a ship. I look at the sky and see nothing but rain. The ground is what matters, Architect. The ground is where we bleed."* (To Torin)

- *"Magic is for cowards who cannot swing an axe. Come down here, Witch, and let me show you what real power tastes like. It tastes like iron."* (To Angelica)

- *"Why does he get to build? Why does he get to be remembered? I am the strongest! I am the King! Why does the stone not obey me?"* (Internal Monologue)

- *(Vane speaking through Ragnar)*: *"This body is... inefficient. The hygiene is deplorable. But the tensile strength is adequate for the task."*

- *(Last Words)*: *"Mine! It's mi—"* (Vaporized by thrusters).
