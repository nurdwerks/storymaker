# Chapter 1: The Golden Cage

The awakening was a betrayal of the senses.

Angelica Ward opened her eyes, expecting the familiar, comforting grit of the Undercity. She expected the air to taste of recycled rust and ozone, heavy with the metallic tang of the ventilation shafts that had been her lullaby for seventeen years. She expected the scratch of the repurposed poly-fiber blanket against her cheek, the lumpy mattress that smelled of mildew, and the low, constant thrum of the Sector 12 generators vibrating through the floorboards. She expected the dark.

Instead, she woke to light.

It was not the flickering, sickly yellow of the sodium lamps that illuminated the Silt, nor the harsh, sterile white of the Academy's interrogation rooms. This light was soft, golden, and terrifyingly natural. It poured through a window larger than the entire crawlspace she had once called home, painting the room in hues of amber and cream.

Angelica sat up, her body coiling instantly into a defensive crouch. Her hand went to her boot for her shiv—a reflex carved into her muscle memory by a lifetime of survival—but her fingers met only soft, high-thread-count silk. She wasn't wearing her flight suit. She was wearing a nightgown of pale gossamer that felt like water against her skin.

Panic, cold and sharp, spiked in her chest. She scanned the room.

It was a palace. The walls were panelled in white marble, veined with gold that caught the morning light. The ceiling vaulted high above her, decorated with intricate frescoes of the Founders gazing down benevolently upon their subjects. The furniture was made of real wood—mahogany, dark and rich—carved with the Imperial Eagle. A vanity table sat in the corner, laden with crystal bottles of perfumes and oils. The air smelled of lavender and something crisp, like ozone after a storm, but cleaner. Expensive. It was the smell of air that had been scrubbed, filtered, and scented, not just recycled. It lacked the underlying coppery tang of blood and rust that permeated every breath in the Undercity.

She swung her legs out of the bed. Her feet sank into a carpet so deep it felt like moss. It was unnerving. In the Silt, the floor was hard, cold metal or packed dirt. This softness felt treacherous, like it could swallow her whole.

"Where..." she whispered, her voice cracking. It sounded too loud in the oppressive silence. The room didn't just lack noise; it lacked *life*. There was no hum of machinery, no distant shouting, no dripping water. It was a vacuum of sound, sealed tight against the chaos of the world below.

She moved. Not with the languid grace of a guest, but with the fluid paranoia of a street rat. She checked the corners of the ceiling first. There—tiny, blinking red LEDs embedded in the crown molding. Micro-cameras. Surveillance. She was being watched. Every breath, every flinch, every heartbeat was being recorded.

She went to the door. It was heavy, solid oak with brass fittings. She tried the handle. Locked. She checked for a keypad, a manual override, a hinge pin she could pop. Nothing. The lock was internal, magnetic, and silent. There was no handle on the inside. It was a smooth, uninterrupted surface of wood, beautiful and impenetrable.

"A cage," she murmured, the realization settling over her like a shroud. "A cage is still a cage, even if the bars are gold."

She paced to the window. It was a single sheet of armored plasteel, at least three inches thick. She pressed her hand against it, feeling the cool surface. Below her, the Zenith stretched out in a dizzying panorama of glass and light. She was high up—Sector 1, the Apex. The spires of the Highborn pierced the smog layer like needles, glistening in the sun. Hover-cars darted between them like schools of bioluminescent fish. Far below, beneath the clouds of pollution that choked the lower levels, was the Silt. Her home. It felt a million miles away.

She looked at her reflection in the glass. The girl staring back didn't look like the Scavenger Prince. Her hair, usually chopped short and greased back with engine oil, had been washed and brushed until it shone. Her skin, usually grey with the Silt-pallor, looked flushed, healthy. They had scrubbed her clean. They had polished her like a trophy to be put on a shelf. She touched her face, tracing the line of her jaw. Who was this stranger?

"They didn't promote me," she said to the reflection. "They imprisoned me."

She turned away from the view. The beauty of it made her sick. It was a lie. This whole city was a lie built on the backs of people who were currently choking on the air the Highborn rejected. She thought of the kids in her sector, coughing up black phlegm, while here, the air smelled of flowers. The injustice of it burned in her throat like bile.

A soft chime echoed through the room, making her jump. She spun around, hands raising into fists.

The wall opposite the bed, a seamless slab of white marble, flickered. A section of it dissolved into a holographic display. A screen. It activated automatically, the Zenith seal—a cog inside a sun—spinning for a moment before resolving into an image.

Angelica's breath hitched. "Leo?"

The face on the screen was familiar, yet wrong. It was her brother, Leo. But he wasn't the grey, wheezing ghost she had left in the medical bay weeks ago. He was sitting up in a bed with crisp white linens. He was wearing a clean patient gown, blue and sterile. His hair was combed.

But the most shocking thing was his color. His cheeks were flushed pink. He wasn't gasping for air. The terrifying rattle of the Silt-Lung—the sound that had haunted Angelica's nightmares since she was six—was gone.

Angelica rushed to the screen, pressing her hands against the cool projection. "Leo! Leo! Can you hear me? Are you okay?"

On the screen, Leo smiled. It was a weak, tired smile, but it was real. "I'm fine, Angie. Better than fine. They're treating me really well."

His voice was clear. No wheeze. No cough. It was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard.

"The doctors..." Leo continued, looking slightly off-camera, as if reading a prompt or checking for approval. "They have medicine we've never even heard of. The food is great. Real fruit. I had a strawberry this morning. It was... sweet."

Angelica's relief was a physical weight lifting from her shoulders. He was alive. He was breathing. She had done it. She had won the Iron Selection, and she had saved him. Tears pricked her eyes, hot and stinging. She wanted to reach through the screen and hold him, to feel the warmth of his skin, to verify that this wasn't just a cruel simulation.

"That's good, Leo," she choked out. "That's really good. You eat up. You get strong."

Leo kept smiling, but his eyes shifted back to the lens. They were urgent, pleading. "I miss you, Angie. I wish you were here."

As he spoke, his hand moved to his chest. It looked like a casual gesture, perhaps scratching an itch or adjusting his gown. But Angelica froze.

He pressed three fingers against his heart, tapping twice.

The breath trapped in Angelica's throat turned to ice. It was the Silt Bow.

The image on the screen blurred, replaced by a sudden, jagged memory. The smell of lavender vanished, replaced by the stench of burning plastic and raw sewage.

She was ten years old again, small and wiry, her knees scraped raw. Leo was six, clutching the back of her shirt so tight his knuckles were white. They were in the Ventilation Tunnels of Sector 12, a maze of rusted pipes and screaming steam vents that ran like arteries beneath the city.

They were running.

Behind them, the heavy, rhythmic clanging of boots on metal grating echoed through the tunnels. The Rust-Eaters were coming. They were a gang of scavengers who had grown too old to fit in the pipes themselves, so they hunted children. Small hands were valuable. Small hands could reach the copper wire deep in the generator housings. They didn't kill the kids; they enslaved them, greasing them up and shoving them into the machinery until they grew too big or got stuck.

"Angie, I can't," Leo wheezed, his small chest heaving. The Silt-Lung was bad today; every breath sounded like crushed glass. "My legs hurt."

"You have to," Angelica hissed, dragging him forward. "If you stop, they take you. If they take you, you go in the pipes."

She knew what happened in the pipes. She had heard the stories. Kids getting stuck, crying for days until the rats found them. Or worse, the fan blades turning on while they were still inside.

They turned a corner and skidded to a halt. Dead end.

Ahead of them was a massive intake fan, part of the atmospheric exchange system. It was supposed to be dormant—the schedule said it was off for maintenance. But the schedule was a lie. The fan was spinning. It was a blur of rust-colored death, the blades moving so fast they were invisible, creating a howling wind that sucked at their clothes.

Behind them, the footsteps got louder. Voices echoed. "Come out, little rats! We got candy! We got fresh water!"

Lies.

Angelica looked at the fan. To the left of the housing, there was a small maintenance hatch. It was open, just a crack. But to get to it, they had to cross the intake zone. They had to move under the blades.

"We have to go through," Angelica said, her voice trembling.

Leo looked at the fan and shook his head, terror wide in his eyes. "No! It'll eat us! It's a monster!"

"The monsters are behind us, Leo! This is just a machine!" Angelica yelled over the roar of the wind. She looked at the control box on the wall. It was rusted shut, the lock fused. She couldn't turn it off.

She looked around frantically. On the floor lay a heavy iron bolt, fallen from some overhead strut. She grabbed it. It weighed five pounds, heavy in her small hand.

"Listen to me," she screamed, grabbing Leo's face. "I'm going to throw this. It's going to hit the gears. The fan will stutter. Just for a second. When it does, you drop. Flat. You become the floor. You slide under. Do not stand up until you are through the hatch. Understand?"

Leo was crying, shaking his head. "I can't! I can't hear you!"

The wind was deafening. He was paralyzed.

Angelica pressed her hand to her chest, right over her heart. She tapped three fingers. *One. Two. Three.* Then she tapped twice. *One. Two.*

It was a game they played in the dark. *Three fingers: I am with you. Two taps: Trust me.*

Leo stared at her hand. He took a breath. He nodded. He pressed his own small hand to his chest and repeated the gesture.

Angelica turned. She hefted the bolt. She timed the rhythm of the fan, looking for the gap in the blades. *Whirrr. Whirrr. Whirrr.*

She threw it.

The bolt flew into the housing. There was a screech of tearing metal that sounded like a dying beast. Sparks showered down. The fan didn't stop, but it *hiccuped*. The blades slowed, shuddering violently.

Angelica slammed her hand into Leo's back. "GO!"

Leo dropped and scrambled. He was small, fast. He slid under the slowing blade, the rusted metal tip missing his spine by inches. He rolled through the maintenance hatch.

The fan roared back to life, the gears grinding through the obstruction. The wind picked up instantly. Angelica dived. She felt the wind tear at her hair. She felt the heat of the blade as it swung down. She hit the floor and scrambled, clawing at the metal grating. She tumbled through the hatch just as the blade slammed into the frame behind her, sparks spraying her boots.

They lay in the dark on the other side, huddled together in the grime. The Rust-Eaters were banging on the fan housing on the other side, screaming curses. But they couldn't get through. They were too big.

Leo was shaking. Angelica wrapped her arms around him, rocking him.

"You did it," she whispered. "You trusted me."

Leo looked up at her, his face streaked with oil and tears. He pressed three fingers to his chest and tapped twice.

"Silt Bow," he whispered. "It means... trouble. But it means you're there."

"Yeah," Angelica said. "It means we survive."

The memory faded, leaving Angelica standing in the opulent, lavender-scented bedroom of the Palace. The silence was deafening after the roar of the fan in her mind.

Ten years. And he still remembered.

*I am captured. Enemy territory. Do not trust them.*

The warmth of the room vanished completely. The luxury of the silk, the beauty of the view—it all stripped away, revealing the steel skeleton beneath. This wasn't a hospital visit. It was a hostage video.

She looked closer at the screen. The camera angle was fixed, tight on Leo's face and upper body. It hid the rest of the room. It hid the door. It hid the guards who were undoubtedly standing just out of frame. Leo wasn't looking off-camera for reassurance; he was looking at a gun.

Angelica forced her face to remain neutral. She forced the smile to stay fixed on her lips, though it felt like a rictus of wire. If they were watching her—and they were—she couldn't let them know she understood the signal. She had to play the grateful sister.

"I miss you too, Leo," she said, infusing her voice with a wobbling, emotional warmth. "I'm so glad you're safe. That's all that matters. Just... just listen to the doctors, okay? Do whatever they say."

Leo's eyes softened. He understood. She had received the message. "I will," he said. "I promise."

The screen cut to black abruptly. No goodbye. No sign-off. Just the cold marble wall staring back at her.

Angelica stood there for a long moment, staring at her own reflection in the dark glass of the inactive screen. Her hands were shaking. She clenched them into fists until the trembling stopped.

"He's telling me to run," she whispered to the empty room. "Which means he knows I'm in danger. But if I run, they hurt him. Which means I have to stay."

She turned and looked at the camera in the corner of the ceiling. She didn't glare. she didn't scream. She simply looked at it, her face a mask of stone.

"They have the leverage," she thought. "But leverage works both ways. If you're holding a hostage, your hands aren't free to fight."

***

Deep in the bowels of the Palace, in a room that smelled of antiseptic and ozone, Prelate Vane watched the feed.

The control room was a masterpiece of surveillance. Walls of monitors displayed the lives of the Palace's inhabitants in high-definition voyeurism. But Vane was only interested in one screen.

He watched Angelica pace. He watched her check the vents, her movements efficient and professional. He watched her pick up a heavy crystal vase from the vanity, weighing it in her hand, testing its balance as a bludgeon before setting it back down.

He smiled. It was not a smile of warmth; it was the satisfied expression of a scientist whose hypothesis had been confirmed. His face, gaunt and hairless, looked skull-like in the blue glow of the monitors. His eyes, replaced by multi-spectral ocular implants years ago, whirred softly as they zoomed in on Angelica's face.

"She searches for weakness," Vane murmured, his voice a dry rasp. "Good. The strong ones always do. They're easier to break because they think they can't be broken. Their arrogance is a handle."

He tapped a key on his console. The feed switched to a thermal overlay. Angelica glowed with heat—the bright red of high cortisol, the white-hot core of suppressed rage.

"Is she the one, Prelate?"

Vane didn't turn. He knew Magister Solon was standing behind him. Solon, with his nervous hands and his adherence to the old prophecies, was useful, but tedious. Solon saw the world through the lens of mysticism, looking for signs and portents in the static. Vane saw the world as it was: a machine in need of repair.

"Truly?" Solon pressed, stepping closer to the screens. "The prophecy is vague. 'The child of the silt shall break the sky.' It could mean anyone. It could be the boy."

Vane chuckled, a sound like dry leaves skittering on pavement. He tapped the screen again, bringing up Angelica's genetic readout. The double helix rotated slowly, highlighted with markers that glowed a brilliant, rare gold.

"The prophecy is poetry, Solon. I do not deal in poetry. I deal in biology." Vane traced the golden markers with a gloved finger. "The genetic markers are promising. 99% compatibility with the Founder strain. She has the Sangreal blood. She is not just a silt-rat; she is a dormant royalty. The boy is merely a carrier. He lacks the fortitude. His lungs crystallized because his body rejected the very air of this world. He is a dead end."

Vane spun his chair around to face Solon. The Magister took a step back, unsettled as always by Vane's mechanical gaze.

"You look at them and see children," Vane said, his voice dropping to a whisper. "I look at them and see raw materials. The boy is a flawed component—useful for leverage, but structural junk. The girl... the girl is titanium. She survived the Undercity. She survived my Arena. She survived the chimera. She metabolizes trauma into fuel."

"She is dangerous," Solon said. "You saw the way she looked at the camera. She knows."

"Of course she knows," Vane said dismissively. "She is intelligent. That is why I chose her. A stupid vessel would be useless. The Interface requires a mind capable of processing infinite data. It requires a will that can stand against the crushing weight of the ship's consciousness. A compliant, happy child would be erased in seconds. I need someone who can push back. I need someone who hates me enough to survive me."

He looked back at the thermal image of Angelica, who was now testing the seal on the window with a fingernail.

"She is burning," Vane said, his artificial eyes gleaming. "She hates us. She hates this room. She hates me. That hate is fuel. It is pure, concentrated will. If I can harness that... if I can direct that fire..."

"She will destroy us," Solon whispered.

"Or," Vane said, turning to face his aide, his smile widening to reveal teeth that looked too perfect, too white, "she will save us. By becoming the engine that drives us to the stars. She is not a person, Solon. She is a component. And I intend to install her."

Solon shuddered, though he tried to hide it. "The last three candidates... the neural feedback liquified their frontal lobes. They didn't just die, Prelate. They were erased."

"Because they were weak," Vane snapped, his patience fraying. "They were Highborn. Bred for comfort. Their minds were soft, pampered things. They had never known true stress. When the Interface pushed, they folded." He gestured to the screen, to Angelica's pacing figure. "But look at her. She has lived in a pressure cooker since the day she was born. Her mind is calloused. It is scar tissue. And scar tissue is tougher than skin."

He walked over to a display case on the far wall. Inside sat a charred, blackened helmet—the remains of the last pilot to attempt the interface.

"The Interface requires a dialogue," Vane lectured, staring at the burnt relic. "The ship is vast. Ancient. It speaks in a language of pure mathematics and fusion fire. A normal mind tries to categorize that data, to organize it. That effort causes the stroke. The brain overheats trying to file the universe into neat little boxes."

He turned back to Solon. "Angelica does not organize chaos. She survives it. She surfs it. She did it in the Silt. She did it in the Arena. She doesn't try to stop the avalanche; she rides it to the bottom. That adaptability is what we need. She won't fight the ship. She will dance with it."

He stood up, his white robes flowing around his skeletal frame. He adjusted his gloves, snapping the latex with a sharp sound. The sound was deafening in the quiet room, a punctuation mark on his sentence.

"Prepare the dining hall," Vane ordered. "It is time to negotiate the terms of her surrender."

***

The summons came an hour later.

The door to Angelica's room hissed open. She was sitting on the bed, cross-legged, waiting. She didn't jump. She didn't scramble. She simply looked up.

Two Wardens stood in the doorway. They were not the standard Zenith guards in grey fatigues. These were the Prelate's personal guard—the White Wardens. They wore ceramic-plate armor that gleamed like polished bone, covering them from head to toe. Their faces were hidden behind blank, golden faceplates. They carried shock-staves that hummed with a low, menacing frequency.

They didn't speak. They didn't have to. One of them gestured with his stave—a sharp motion indicating the hallway.

Angelica stood up. She smoothed the silk of her nightgown. She felt ridiculous in it, vulnerable. She wished for her boots. She wished for the weight of her jacket. But she held her head high. She was Angelica Ward. She had survived the Stone Season. She had survived the Selection. She would not be intimidated by a dress code.

She walked toward them. "Lead the way, boys. Don't want to be late for the execution."

The Wardens didn't react. They fell into step around her, one in front, one behind. A prisoner escort.

They walked through corridors that seemed to stretch on forever. The Palace was a labyrinth of gold and white. Huge windows looked out over the clouds. Statues of long-dead heroes watched them pass with blind stone eyes. The silence was absolute. There were no servants, no other people. Just the rhythmic *clack-clack-clack* of the Wardens' boots on the marble floor. Angelica moved silently, her bare feet making no sound on the cold stone. She was a ghost in the machine.

She memorized the route. *Left at the Founder's statue. Right at the tapestry of the Great Ascent. Straight past the double doors with the sunburst.* She was mapping the cage. She noted the lack of guards at certain intersections, the placement of the cameras, the thickness of the doors. Her mind was a tactical computer, processing every detail for future exploitation. She noted that the ventilation grates here were decorative, filigreed brass that would be impossible to remove quickly. She noted that the windows were sealed, not latched. This wasn't a building; it was a pressurized container.

As they passed a massive, vaulted gallery, Angelica slowed her pace. The walls were covered in a mural that spanned fifty feet. It depicted the "First Landing." In the painting, the Founders—tall, golden, angelic figures—were stepping off a gleaming silver ship. They were handing loaves of bread and glowing orbs of light to a huddled mass of dirty, grateful people on the ground. The caption, etched in gold leaf, read: *The Gift of the Sky.*

Angelica stopped, staring at it. The guards halted, their armor clanking.

"Move along," the lead Warden grunted.

"It's a lie," she whispered.

She looked at the faces of the "huddled masses." They looked happy. Grateful. But she knew the history her father had whispered to her before he died. The Founders hadn't given bread. They had given orders. They hadn't shared the light; they had hoarded it in the Zenith and left the rest of humanity to rot in the shadow of the ship's engines.

She pointed to a figure in the background of the mural—a soldier holding a spear, keeping the crowd back.

"That's the only honest part of this painting," she said, her voice dripping with venom. "The boot on the neck."

"I said move," the Warden barked, shoving her shoulder with his armored hand.

Angelica stumbled but caught herself. She looked at the Warden. He was faceless behind his helmet, just another part of the architecture.

"You believe it, don't you?" she asked him. "You think you're protecting civilization. But you're just guarding a tomb."

The Warden raised his shock-stave. "One more word, and I carry you."

Angelica smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. "You can carry my body," she said. "But you can't carry the weight of what you've done. It's going to crush you one day."

She turned and kept walking before he could strike her. She heard the Warden hesitate, the hum of his stave faltering for a microsecond. She had planted a seed. It might not grow today, or tomorrow. But doubt was a weed. It grew in the cracks of the strongest armor.

They arrived at a set of double doors carved from black obsidian. The guards stopped. The doors swung open silently.

The room beyond was a private dining hall. It was smaller than the ballroom she had seen in the vids, intimate and terrifyingly opulent. A single table sat in the center, set for two. The tablecloth was white linen. The silverware was real silver. A crystal chandelier hung above it, casting a prism of light onto the plates. The walls were lined with tapestries depicting the glorious history of the Zenith, myths of a golden age that Angelica knew was a fabrication. She saw images of the Founders handing down technology to grateful, kneeling masses—a stark contrast to the reality of the purges and the Silt.

And there, sitting at the head of the table, was Prelate Vane.

He looked exactly as he had on the screens during the Selection—tall, skeletal, his white robes immaculate. He was cutting a piece of steak with surgical precision. He didn't look up as she entered.

"Sit, Angelica," he said. His voice was smooth, cultured, and devoid of warmth. "The protein is synthesized, but the flavor profile is excellent. Based on a pre-Collapse bovine genome."

Angelica stood by the chair opposite him. She didn't sit. She looked at the steak, then at the knife in Vane's hand. It was sharp.

"I'm not hungry," she said.

Vane paused. He looked up. His eyes—those milky, mechanical eyes—locked onto hers. He smiled. "Hunger is a biological signal. It can be ignored, but the body requires fuel. Sit. That is not a request."

The Warden behind her took a step forward, the hum of his shock-stave rising in pitch.

Angelica pulled the chair out and sat. She sat on the edge of the seat, ready to spring. She placed her hands on the table, palms flat.

"Where is my brother?" she asked.

Vane put a piece of steak in his mouth. He chewed slowly, savoring it. He swallowed, then wiped his mouth with a linen napkin.

"Safe," he said. "Receiving the best care in the Zenith. As I promised. Dr. Aris is personally overseeing his treatment. The crystallization in his lungs has been arrested. He is breathing at 98% efficiency."

"I want to see him," Angelica said. "In person. Not on a screen."

Vane took a sip of wine. It was a deep, blood red. "That can be arranged. Visitation privileges are... negotiable. They depend entirely on your behavior."

"My behavior?" Angelica let out a short, sharp laugh. "I won your game, Vane. I survived your arena. I killed your monsters. The deal was: I win, he lives. I kept my end."

"You survived, yes," Vane said, setting his glass down. "But the game is not over, Angelica. The Selection was merely the audition. You have passed the first round. Now, the real work begins."

He leaned forward. The light from the chandelier reflected in his artificial eyes, giving them a cold, predatory glint.

"Your brother's lungs are failing," he said softly. "It is genetic. The Silt accelerated it, yes, but the flaw is in his DNA. We can save him. We can grow him a new pair in the bio-labs. Custom-grown, perfectly compatible organs. He can live a long, healthy life. He can run. He can breathe the air of the upper decks without a mask."

Angelica felt a pang of longing so sharp it hurt. A healthy Leo. It was the dream she had carried since she was six years old. It was the reason she had stolen, scrapped, and killed.

"But," Vane continued, his voice dropping to a whisper, "that care is expensive, my dear. The resources required to grow organ replacements are... significant. And they require maintenance. Ongoing treatment. If the treatment stops... the rejection begins. And the rejection is very, very painful."

The threat hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. He wasn't just threatening to kill Leo; he was threatening to torture him. To give him hope and then rip it away.

Angelica looked at the steak knife on the table next to her plate. It was silver, heavy, with a serrated edge. She calculated the distance to his throat. Eight feet. The table was wide. Vane was fast—she had seen him move. There were two guards behind her. One at the door.

*Scenario A: Grab the knife. Lunge. Warden 1 engages. Shock-stave to the spine. Paralysis. Failure.*
*Scenario B: Flip the table. Distraction. Lunge. Vane retreats. Wardens open fire. Death. Failure.*
*Scenario C: Throw the knife. Aim for the eye. Vane has implants; likely reflexes are enhanced. Miss probability: 80%. Failure.*

Success probability: Zero.

She slowly unclenched her hand from the table cloth.

"Define 'cooperate'," she said, her voice ice.

Vane spread his hands. "It is simple. You are the Champion of the Iron Selection. The people love you. The Silt-rats see you as a hero. The Highborn see you as a curiosity. You are valuable capital."

He gestured to the room, to the palace around them.

"Be the symbol the people need," he said. "Be the winner. Smile for the cameras. Attend the galas. Wear the dresses. Tell them that the system works. Tell them that a girl from the gutter can rise to the Palace if she just works hard enough. Make them believe in the dream, Angelica. Because if they believe in the dream, they won't burn down the city."

"You want me to lie to them," she said. "You want me to tell them that there's hope, when we both know the game is rigged."

"Hope is a tool," Vane said. "It keeps the gears turning. Without it, the machine grinds to a halt. And if the machine stops, everyone dies. The Zenith falls. The Silt drowns. Do you want that on your conscience?"

"And when I'm done playing dress-up?" Angelica asked. "What then?"

Vane's smile thinned. "When the time comes... you will serve a higher purpose. You will be the Vessel for the future. But we can discuss that later. For now, all you need to do is eat your dinner."

He gestured to her plate. "Eat. You need your strength."

Angelica looked at the steak. It was perfectly cooked, rare in the middle. It looked delicious. It looked like surrender.

She realized the trap. It was a gilded leash. If she fought, Leo died. If she ran, Leo died. If she refused, Leo died. Vane held the only thing in the world she loved, and he was squeezing.

But if she submitted... if she became his puppet... she lost herself. She became another cog in his machine.

She looked at Vane. He was watching her, expecting her to crumble. Expecting tears. Expecting begging.

She picked up her fork. She picked up the knife.

She didn't look at Vane. she looked at the meat. She cut a piece, the serrated blade slicing through the fibers with ease. She stabbed it with her fork.

She lifted it to her mouth and took a bite.

It wasn't acceptance of the peace. It was fuel for the war. She chewed slowly, deliberately. She swallowed.

"It needs salt," she said.

Vane blinked. For a second, he looked surprised. Then, he threw his head back and laughed. It was a dry, rattling sound.

"Excellent," he said. "Simply excellent. I knew you were the one."

Angelica took another bite. She didn't smile. She didn't cry. She just ate. She was feeding the engine. She was keeping the machine running.

*Wait,* she told herself. *Wait for the mistake. Wait for the crack in the armor. He thinks he bought me. He thinks I'm a pet.*

*Let him think it.*

*A pet has teeth.*

She looked at Vane across the table, her eyes cold and hard.

*I will eat your food,* she thought. *I will wear your dresses. I will smile for your cameras. And while I'm doing it, I will learn your codes. I will map your palace. I will find where you keep your secrets.*

*And then, I will burn this golden cage to the ground.*

"Pass the salt," she said.

Vane slid the silver shaker across the table. Angelica caught it. Her hand was steady.

The game had begun.
