# Character Profile: Debit & Credit (The Twins)

**Archetype:** The Silent Brutes / The Human Barriers
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Moral apathy; they have surrendered their agency to become tools of their master's will).
**Virtue Mask:** DUTY (They claim their violence is "just business").

## I. Role in the Story

Debit and Credit are identical, chemically-bulked bodyguards for Baron Gilded. They are the physical enforcers of the Baron's financial dominion, never speaking and never questioning orders.

- **The Function:** They use their physical mass to control movement within Gilded's sanctum, acting as walls rather than men.
- **The Behavior:** They subtly obstruct Angelica’s path—forcing her to walk around them or wait for permission to move—to remind her that in Gilded's presence, she has no agency.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 10: The Gala of Ghosts](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L838-854)
- **Defining Quote:** "Biological assets are so prone to leakage." (Reveals flaw: SLOTH)
