## Chapter 20: The Power Failure

### Scene 1: The Sabotage

- **Key Event:** Deep in the ship's Engineering Deck, a squad of "Tech-Priests" loyal to Vane executes a manual sabotage protocol.
- **Detailed Description:** The Engineering Deck is a labyrinth of steam pipes, coolant tanks, and massive power conduits that hum with the energy of the ship's reactor. The Tech-Priests, their robes stained with grease and their eyes glowing with the blue light of the control chips, move with synchronized efficiency. They do not use computer overrides; they use thermal lances. They gather around the primary power trunk line that feeds the Command Spire. With no hesitation, they ignite their lances. The superheated plasma slices through the thick insulation layers, melting the copper and gold filaments inside. Sparks shower the deck like fireworks. The hum of the reactor pitch-shifts into a groan as the load becomes unbalanced. Alarms begin to scream, but the Priests ignore them, continuing to sever the "arteries" of the ship until the main conduit hangs loose, sparking and dead.
- **Internal Conflict:** The ship itself seems to recoil. The lights on the Engineering Deck flicker and die. The Tech-Priests stand in the darkness, their faces illuminated only by the dying sparks. They do not cheer. They do not speak. They simply wait for the next command, stripped of all agency.

### Scene 2: The Suffocation

- **Key Event:** On the Bridge, the lights cut out instantly. The air scrubbers spin down into silence. The tactical hololiths fade to black.
- **Detailed Description:** The sudden darkness is absolute. For a few seconds, there is only the sound of confused breathing and the rustle of clothing. Then, the emergency lights kick in—dim, red strobes that cast long, terrified shadows. The temperature begins to drop immediately. Without power, the environmental systems cannot maintain the 20-degree standard. The air grows stale as the CO2 scrubbers fail. The silence is heavy, pressing against the ears of the crew. Angelica stands by the captain's chair, her face a mask of red-lit determination. She realizes Vane's strategy. He isn't trying to breach the door anymore; he is trying to smoke them out. He is turning the bridge into a tomb.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica fights a wave of claustrophobia. She remembers the "Stone Season," the cold dark of the early days. She knows how fast a room this size becomes toxic with thirty people breathing in it. She has to make a choice: open the blast doors and face Vane's army, or suffocate in the dark. She chooses the dark.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She keys the local comms, her voice calm and amplified by the emergency battery in her suit. "Masks on. Shallow breaths. Nobody opens that door. If we open it, we lose the ship. I'd rather suffocate than let him have it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He's trying to choke us. Coward."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "No. He's trying to force a reboot. He needs the bridge intact. He just doesn't need us breathing."

### Scene 3: The Repair

- **Key Event:** Zephyr, who was in the ventilation shafts flanking Vane's position, receives a distress ping from Lisbet. He realizes the bridge has lost power. He is the only one close enough to the auxiliary junction to fix it.
- **Detailed Description:** The ventilation shaft is cramped, smelling of dust and old metal. Zephyr crawls on his elbows, his cybernetic arm dragging his weight. He reaches the auxiliary power junction—a small, recessed panel in the wall of the shaft. He kicks the grate open and drops into a maintenance crawlspace. It is filled with "Seeker Drones"—small, spherical security bots that Vane has deployed to hunt intruders. The drones activate, their red eyes locking onto Zephyr.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr is tired. His arm is low on power. He has half a charge in his blaster. He looks at the junction box on the far wall. It's fifty feet away, through a gauntlet of hostile drones. He sighs, flipping his lucky coin. He catches it. Heads. "figures," he mutters.

- **Key Event:** Zephyr engages the drones in a running firefight while trying to reach the junction.
- **Detailed Description:** The crawlspace erupts in laser fire. Zephyr slides under a pipe, firing his blaster over his shoulder. He hits a drone, blowing it into shrapnel. A laser grazes his shoulder, burning through his leather duster and scorching the skin. He grunts but keeps moving. He uses his cybernetic arm to rip a steam pipe loose, spraying high-pressure steam at the drones to blind their sensors. He reaches the junction box. It's a mess of cut wires. He has to hot-wire it manually.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr works with frantic precision. His organic hand holds the wires; his cybernetic hand strips the insulation. He is exposed. A drone hovers behind him, charging its weapon. He can hear the whine of the capacitor. He knows he can't turn around in time. He focuses on the wire. _Red to Blue. Ground the Green._ He twists the wires together. Sparks fly.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He connects the circuit just as the drone fires. The sudden surge of power to the junction creates an electrical arc that fries the drone instantly. Zephyr is thrown back by the shock, his hair standing on end, his cybernetic arm twitching. He laughs, a breathless, pained wheeze. The lights in the crawlspace flicker from red to white. He did it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Lights on, Princess. You can thank me later. Put it on my tab."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet (over comms):** "Zephyr! Are you okay? Your vitals spiked!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Just a little jump-start, Sparky. Keeps the heart beating."

### Scene 4: The Matriarch's Vigil

- **Key Event:** A hidden observer.
- **Detailed Description:** In a fortified bunker deep within the civilian sectors, **Matriarch Lilith Night** monitors the power failure through a private terminal powered by an independent generator. She has been tracking Vane's coup attempt and Ward's resistance since it began. The loss of main power to the bridge is concerning—Ward is her investment, the linchpin of her long-term plans. She studies the grid schematic, noting that the auxiliary power is still functional. When the lights on her display shift from red to green, she allows herself a thin smile. The Ward girl is resourceful. Kaelen chose well, even if he never admitted it.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Matriarch Lilith Night:** "The Rogue restored auxiliary power. Impressive. Perhaps House Night should acquire his debt. A useful asset."
