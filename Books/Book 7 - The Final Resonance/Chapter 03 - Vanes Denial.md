## Chapter 03: Vane's Denial

### Scene 1: The Ship-Wide Broadcast

- **Key Event:** Vane addresses the population via holograms. He portrays the Sphere as a "Traveler" or a "Test," denying the threat. He claims he is in negotiations.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Vane** — He uses his charisma to gaslight the crew. He believes he can manipulate a cosmic force just like he manipulated the Council.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "Do not fear the geometry. It is merely a visitor. I have the situation under control."

### Scene 2: The Lower Decks / The Shadows

- **Key Event:** **Old Man Rust** sits alone in a maintenance alcove. Being blind, he tilts his head, listening to the vibration of the ship's hull.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Rust:** "That ain't a visitor. That's a tombstone. I can smell the earth."

### Scene 3: Vane's Private Sanctum

- **Key Event:** Alone, Vane drops the facade. He speaks to the injection ports in his arm (his link to the Prima-Materia/Entity). He pleads for recognition.
- **Key Event:** He reveals his delusion: he thinks the Sphere has come to _collect_ him as a prophet, not destroy the ship.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "I have prepared the harvest. I am your vessel. Acknowledge me."
