### Chapter 11: The Cannibal Gang

#### Scene 1: The Trap

The sign was crude, painted on a piece of corrugated metal with red paint that was too bright to be anything but synthetic. *REFUGEE CAMP. SAFE ZONE. FREE WATER.* An arrow pointed down a dark, narrow corridor that smelled faintly of woodsmoke and hope.

"It's a trap," Hatcher said immediately, spitting on the floor. He shifted his plasma rifle, his eyes scanning the shadows with the paranoia of a man who had survived too long. "Free water? In the Stone Season? You might as well put up a sign saying 'Free Unicorns'. Nobody gives anything away down here."

"We need water," Angelica rasped. Her throat was raw, her lips cracked and bleeding. They had been moving for two days without a drop. The heat from the lower levels was dehydrating them faster than the cold had frozen them. Her tongue felt like a piece of sandpaper in her mouth. "We have to check. Even if it's a trap, there might be a tap."

"It's bait, kid," Hatcher insisted, but he followed her anyway. He knew she was right. Desperation made you stupid, but thirst made you dead. "Keep your finger on the trigger and your back to the wall."

They approached the camp. It was set up in an old subway station, the tracks long since rusted away. Tents made of plastic sheeting were clustered around a central fire pit. And there was a smell. Not just woodsmoke.

Roasting meat.

It was a rich, savory scent that made their stomachs cramp with sudden, violent hunger.

"Where did they get meat?" Zephyr whispered, sniffing the air like a bloodhound. His stomach rumbled, a traitorous sound in the quiet. "I haven't seen a rat in miles. The rats are smarter than us; they left."

"Maybe they found a supply cache," Kaelen suggested hopefully, though his hand rested on the hilt of his sword. He wanted to believe in luck.

"Or maybe the supply cache is us," Ria muttered, her shotgun ready. She didn't believe in luck. She believed in supply chains, and this one didn't make sense.

#### Scene 2: The Ambush

The "Survivors" emerged from the tents as the group entered the light. There were about twenty of them. They looked too healthy. Their cheeks were flushed, their eyes bright. They smiled too much. Their clothes were clean, scavenged from the better parts of the wreckage.

A man stepped forward. He was big, wearing a butcher's apron over a Zenith guard uniform that had been stripped of insignia. He held a cleaver that was stained dark. His arms were thick with muscle, fed on protein that shouldn't exist down here.

"Welcome!" he boomed, spreading his arms. "Travelers! Come in, come in. We have water. We have stew. We are the hospitality committee of Sector 4."

"What kind of stew?" Hatcher asked, his finger tightening on the trigger. He didn't lower his weapon.

"Rabbit," the man said, his smile widening to show white, strong teeth. "Found a whole warren of them in the ventilation shafts. Lucky, right? Big, fat, juicy rabbits."

"Very lucky," Angelica said, her golden eyes narrowing. She scanned the camp. She saw a pile of boots in the corner. Zenith boots. High quality. Too many for a refugee camp. And they were empty.

The man noticed Kaelen. He looked at the boy's fine coat, his delicate features, and the sword at his hip. He looked at him not as a threat, but as a menu item.

"Nice steel," the man said, licking his lips. "You look... soft, boy. Like good veal. Not tough like the old ones."

He swung. It wasn't the cleaver. He pulled a lead pipe from behind his back and swung it at Kaelen's head with a speed that belied his size. It was a practiced move, designed to stun, not kill. They wanted the meat fresh.

Kaelen dodged, his reflexes honed by years of fencing, but he was weak from hunger. He stumbled, falling to one knee.

"Now!" the butcher screamed.

The trap sprung. From the ceiling, weighted nets dropped. They were heavy, woven with razor-wire. They fell like rain.

#### Scene 3: The Fight

"Ambush!" Ria roared.

She didn't try to dodge the net. She caught it. She grabbed the heavy mesh with her metal hands and ripped it apart. The razor wire sparked against her skin, but it didn't cut. She roared, a sound of pure mechanical rage, and charged the butcher. She was a tank in a room full of infantry.

Hatcher hadn't been netted. He had stayed back, in the shadows, waiting for the betrayal he knew was coming.

*SNAP-HISSS.*

His rifle coughed blue fire. The first shot took a cannibal on the catwalk in the head. The man tumbled down, dead before he hit the ground.

*SNAP-HISSS. SNAP-HISSS.*

Two more shots. Two more bodies. Hatcher didn't miss. He didn't hesitate. He was a metronome of death.

Zephyr scrambled for cover behind a crate. He tried to fire his arm-cannon, but it just clicked. "Still dead! Useless piece of junk!" He pulled his deck of razor-cards and started throwing them. A card embedded itself in an attacker's throat. "That's for the rabbit lie! Rabbits don't have thumbs!"

Kaelen rolled under a table, slashing at ankles. He moved like a shadow, cutting tendons. He wasn't strong enough to kill them with one blow, so he crippled them. He fought with a desperate, precise elegance.

Ria reached the butcher. He swung the cleaver. It clanged off her shoulder plate, chipping the paint but not the metal. She grabbed his wrist. She squeezed. There was a wet crunch of bone. The butcher screamed, dropping the weapon.

"What is in the pot?" Ria demanded, lifting him off the ground by his throat. Her yellow eyes burned with disgust. "What is in the pot?"

#### Scene 4: The Pot

The butcher gurgled, clawing at her iron grip. His face turned purple. "Meat... just meat... we have to eat..."

Ria threw him into the fire pit. He scrambled out, screaming, his apron smoking.

She kicked the heavy iron pot over. The stew spilled across the concrete floor, a thick, brown sludge.

Bones spilled out.

They weren't rabbit bones. They were long, thick bones. A femur. A ribcage. And rolling out of the sludge, a skull. It was small. A child's skull. The sockets stared blindly at the ceiling.

And something else glittered in the mess. A Zenith signet ring, gold and ruby.

Zephyr walked over, his face pale. He picked up the ring with a trembling hand. He wiped the gravy off it.

"I know this ring," he whispered. "This belonged to Lord Marcus. He... he owed me money. He was a gambler."

He looked at the bones. He looked at the butcher, who was whimpering on the floor, nursing his broken wrist.

"He owed me money," Zephyr said again, his voice breaking. "And you ate him. You ate my debt."

Hatcher walked up. He looked at the pot, then at the survivors who were now cowering, their ambush broken. He didn't say a word. He just began looting the bodies for ammo. He checked pockets, taking lighters and knives.

"Man is the only animal that cooks its neighbor," Hatcher said, stuffing a magazine into his pocket. "Wolves have better manners. Even the Blighted don't use spices. This... this is civilized evil."

Angelica looked at the camp. It wasn't a refuge. It was a larder. It was a factory of death.

"Burn it," she said, her voice cold. "Burn it all. Leave nothing."

### Chapter 12: The Library

#### Scene 1: The Shelter

They left the cannibals dead or dying, the smoke of the burning camp rising behind them like a pyre. They pushed deeper, looking for a place to rest that didn't smell of roasted human.

They found it in the ruins of an ancient archive. It was a massive, vaulted chamber buried deep in the Undercity foundation. It had been sealed for centuries, protected by blast doors that had rusted shut but cracked open during the fall.

Inside, it was a cathedral of paper. Books. Millions of them. Rotting shelves towered into the darkness, filled with the history of the world before the Zenith. It was dry, dusty, and freezing. The temperature was dropping towards -10 degrees. The air was still, heavy with the scent of decaying cellulose and lost words.

The architecture was stunning, even in ruin. Massive stone pillars supported a ceiling painted with faded frescoes of the old sky—blue, with white clouds, not the dome. Statues of scholars and scientists stood in niches, their faces worn away by time. It was a place of reverence, now turned into a tomb.

#### Scene 2: The Cold

"It's colder here," Lisbet chattered, her teeth clicking together like castanets. She hugged herself, her rubber coat crinkling. She looked tiny against the towering shelves. "Why is it colder? It should be insulated."

"Thermal sink," Aris said, his breath blooming in the air. "The paper absorbs moisture and heat. We are standing in a giant refrigerator. The thermal mass of this much paper is immense. It steals heat from the air."

Angelica tried to check her datapad, but her fingers were numb. She couldn't feel the screen. She looked at her hand. It was blue. Her circulation was failing. The cold was a physical weight, pressing down on her shoulders.

"Hypothermia in two hours," Aris diagnosed, glancing at Kaelen, who was already turning a dangerous shade of grey. Kaelen was leaning against a shelf, his eyes unfocused. "We need a heat source immediately. Or we start losing fingers. Then toes. Then consciousness."

They looked around. There was no wood. There was no furniture. The archive was built of steel and stone. Just metal shelves and... books. Millions of words.

#### Scene 3: The Fuel

Aris walked to the nearest shelf. He grabbed a handful of books. They were old, bound in leather and cloth. He weighed them in his hand, calculating their caloric value.

"Cellulose," he said. "Flammable. High energy density. It burns hot and fast."

He dumped them on the floor and pulled out a lighter.

"Wait!" Angelica cried, grabbing his arm. "You can't. These are books. History. Pre-Ascension history. This might be the only copy of... of whatever this is."

She picked up a book. *The History of the First Flight.* It was heavy, the leather cracked with age. She opened it. There were diagrams of machines that flew without magic. Airplanes. Rockets.

"Miss Vance," Aris said, his voice cold. "History doesn't keep you warm. Fire does. We are biological entities requiring thermal regulation. The books are fuel. That is their only value right now. Would you prefer to freeze to death clutching a copy of *Hamlet*? The tragedy would be poetic, but fatal."

Aris pulled another book from the shelf. He paused. It was a handwritten journal. *Notes on the Protomolecule - Dr. S. Vance.*

"Interesting," he murmured. "This is your grandfather's journal, Angelica. It details the initial discovery of the Prima-Materia."

Angelica froze. "Let me see it."

She took the journal. It was filled with her grandfather's handwriting. Equations. Sketches of the black goo. Warnings. *It is not fuel,* he had written. *It is a key.*

"We keep this one," she said, tucking it into her coat. "Burn the rest."

He looked at Kaelen, who had slumped against a shelf, his eyes fluttering shut. "Do you want to save the book, or the boy? It's a binary choice. Data or life."

Angelica looked at the book. She thought of her father, who used to read to her about the old world. She thought of the knowledge lost in the fall. She thought of the civilization that had built this place, hoping to be remembered.

Then she looked at Kaelen's blue lips. She saw the frost forming on his eyelashes.

#### Scene 4: The Loss

Angelica looked at the book in her hand. It was heavy. It smelled of old vanilla and dust. It was knowledge. It was the past. It was everything the Zenith had tried to hide.

She looked at Kaelen. He was dying.

"Do it," she whispered.

She grabbed another book. *The Collected Poems of Earth.* She opened it to a random page.

*Do not go gentle into that good night,* the text read. *Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*

She tore the page out. The sound was loud in the silent library. She crumpled it up and threw it onto the pile.

Aris lit the match. The paper caught instantly. The flame was yellow and warm.

They gathered around the fire, feeding it with literature. Philosophy, science, poetry—it all burned the same. The words curled and blackened, turning into ash. *War and Peace* burned for ten minutes. *The Odyssey* burned for five. *The Principia Mathematica* burned with a blue flame.

"We are burning history to buy another hour of heat," Angelica said, watching the words turn to ash. She held her hands out to the flames, feeling the blood return to her fingertips. "I hope it's worth it. I hope we're worth it."

"It's warm," Lisbet said, closing her eyes. "That's all that matters right now. The past can burn. I want to live in the present."

"The past is just kindling for the future," Aris muttered, throwing a medical journal into the fire. "It's the most efficient use of data I've seen in years."

Angelica picked up a book titled *The Constitution*. She hesitated for a second, then threw it in. The fire roared.

"My father used to read to me," Kaelen whispered, staring at the fire. "Before the debt. He read about knights. About honor."

"Knights froze to death too," Aris said, adding a dictionary to the pyre. "Honor is poor insulation."

### Chapter 13: Ria's Decline

#### Scene 1: The Rust

The humidity in the tunnels leading out of the library was high. Condensation dripped from every surface. For the humans, it was uncomfortable. For Ria, it was torture. It was a slow, agonizing death sentence written in oxidation.

Her skin, the bio-metal alloy that she had bonded with, was reacting. It was spotting with orange rust. It started at her joints—knuckles, elbows, knees—and spread like a rash. It wasn't just cosmetic. The rust was eating into the integrity of the bond. It was devouring the very thing that made her strong.

She scratched at it. A flake of metal peeled off, revealing raw, red flesh underneath. It was infected. The bond was rejecting her, or she was rejecting it. The smell of oxidized iron and pus followed her like a cloud. She tried to hide it, pulling her sleeves down, but the orange stains seeped through the fabric, betraying her weakness.

She remembered her brother, Jax. He had died of infection. A simple cut that went bad. She had promised herself she would be stronger. She had become metal to be invincible. And now, the metal was killing her. The irony was bitter.

#### Scene 2: The Pain

Every step was agony. Her knee joint ground with a sound like a rusty hinge. *SCREECH. Click. SCREECH.* It was a sound that set their teeth on edge. It felt like someone was pouring sand into her veins. It was a grinding, constant sensation of friction that made her want to scream.

"Ria, stop," Angelica said, seeing the grimace on the soldier's face. "Let us look at it. You're limping."

"I'm fine," Ria snapped, but she stumbled. She caught herself on a wall, leaving a smear of rust and blood. "Just... needs to warm up."

"You're not fine," Aris observed, walking up behind her. He examined her arm without asking. "Oxidation of the external dermis. Without Zenith maintenance oils, your bond is degrading. You are literally seizing up. The servos are fusing. If the corrosion reaches the actuators, you will be paralyzed."

"I need oil," Ria gasped, clutching her knee. "Grease. Anything. I feel like I'm turning into stone. It feels like my bones are fusing together."

"There is no oil," Aris said, consulting his datapad. "The maintenance bays are in Sector 7. That's ten miles away."

"Then find something else!" Ria shouted, grabbing Aris by the collar. "You're the genius! Fix me!"

Aris looked at her hand, unblinking. "Violence will not lubricate your joints, Ria. It will only accelerate the wear."

#### Scene 3: The Fear

They set up camp in a dry alcove. Ria sat away from the others, staring at her hands. Her fingers were locked in a claw shape. She tried to open them, but they wouldn't move. She tried to pick up her shotgun, but her grip failed. The weapon clattered to the floor, a useless hunk of metal like her.

She tried to pick up a nutrient bar. Her fingers wouldn't close. She couldn't eat. She looked at the food, hunger gnawing at her, but she couldn't bring it to her mouth. She was helpless.

She was crying. But she had no tears. Her tear ducts were metallic. She just made a dry, heaving sound.

"I'm locking up," she whispered to Angelica, her voice small. "If I freeze... I become a statue. I'll be trapped in my own body. I won't be able to move, but I'll still be alive. I'll starve to death inside a metal coffin. I'll be conscious for every second of it. I'll feel the rust eating me."

It was a vulnerability Angelica had never seen in the Iron Vanguard. Ria was terrified. She was the strongest of them, and she was the most fragile. She was a machine without a mechanic.

Lisbet walked over. She touched Ria's arm with her gloved hand. "You're broken," she said simply. "Like a bad circuit."

"I'm not broken," Ria snarled, but there was no heat in it.

"Yes, you are," Lisbet said. "But we fix broken things. That's what we do."

Angelica sat beside her. "We'll fix it. I promise."

She dug into their supplies. She pulled out a jar they had taken from the cannibal camp. It was animal fat. Rendered grease from the stew. It was vile, but it was lipid-heavy.

"It's not Zenith oil," Angelica said. "But it's lubrication."

She scooped a handful of the foul-smelling grease and began to rub it into Ria's elbow. She massaged the joint, working the fat into the cracks in the metal. It was dirty, intimate work.

Ria closed her eyes. As the grease worked into the joint, the pain subsided slightly. She hallucinated for a moment. She saw Jax, her brother. He was holding a can of oil. *It's okay, sis,* he said. *I'll fix you.* But when she opened her eyes, it was Angelica.

"Why are you helping me?" Ria asked, her voice raspy. "I tried to kill you in the Arena."

"Because you're the tank," Angelica said, wiping grease from her cheek. "And we need a tank."

#### Scene 4: The Result

Ria hissed in pain, then sighed as the joint loosened. She flexed her arm. It moved silently.

"It works," she breathed.

She looked at her hands, covered in animal fat and rust. She looked at Angelica, who was dirty, tired, but tending to her with gentle hands.

"I turned myself into a tank to survive the war," Ria said softly. "I gave up my touch. I gave up my skin. And now... now I'm just scrap metal. I'm rusting junk. Is this what I sold my soul for?"

"You're alive," Angelica said firmly. "And as long as you're alive, you're not junk. You're the reason we're still breathing. Now give me your other arm."

Ria nodded, but she didn't look convinced. She looked at the rust spots on her chest. They were spreading towards her heart. She knew that if the rust reached her core, the grease wouldn't help. She was a ticking clock, winding down. She looked at Hatcher, who was cleaning his gun.

"You knew, didn't you?" Ria asked him. "That metal breaks?"

Hatcher looked up. "Everything breaks, kid. The trick is to be useful until you do. And try not to rust on the carpet."

She found a shard of mirror on the floor. She picked it up. She looked at her face. The rust was creeping up her neck, like a cancer. She smashed the mirror against the wall.

### Chapter 14: Zephyr's Poverty

#### Scene 1: The Counter

Zephyr was lagging behind. He was walking with a strange, lopsided gait, dragged down by the weight on his left side. His breath came in ragged gasps. The coat, usually his armor, felt like a lead blanket.

His wrist counter beeped. A mournful, dying sound. It was the sound of a contract closing. It was the sound of bankruptcy.

He looked at the display.

*BALANCE: 000000.*

The **Wealth Toll** had finally caught up. He had spent his last credit on the jump from the Spire. Without funds to burn, the contract was void. The magic evaporated. The deal was done.

#### Scene 2: The Shutdown

His Golden Arm, the masterpiece of cybernetics, went dead. The internal gyro-stabilizers spun down with a whine. The servos locked.

It dropped to his side, a fifty-pound dead weight of brass and steel. It yanked his shoulder down, popping the joint. The pain was blinding. It felt like his arm was being ripped out of the socket.

Zephyr cried out, falling to his knees. He tried to lift it with his organic arm, but it was too heavy. It was like being handcuffed to an anvil. He was anchored to the floor by his own greed.

"It's useless," he sobbed, dragging himself forward. "I'm useless. It's just metal now. It's just scrap."

He hallucinated for a moment. He saw **Baron Gilded**, the crime lord who had given him the arm. Gilded was laughing, counting coins. *You thought you could buy freedom?* Gilded whispered. *You can only rent it, boy. And your lease is up. I'm repossessing the asset.*

He remembered the day he got the arm. The pain of the surgery. The smell of burning flesh. He had thought it was a gift. Now he knew it was a leash.

He tried to stand, using the arm as a crutch, but it slipped on the wet floor. He fell face first into the mud.

He saw Hatcher watching him. "Don't look at me," Zephyr spat.

"I've seen worse," Hatcher said. "I've seen men sell their eyes for a drink. You just sold your arm for a lifestyle."

"It wasn't a lifestyle," Zephyr said. "It was survival."

"Was it?" Hatcher asked. "Or was it just shiny?"

Hatcher pulled a dented flask from his coat. "Here. Drink."

Zephyr took it. It burned going down. "What is this?"

"Engine coolant and gin," Hatcher said. "Numbing agent. Best vintage in the Undercity."

"It tastes like regret," Zephyr coughed.

"That's the gin," Hatcher said. "The coolant tastes like peppermint."

#### Scene 3: The Burden

They reached a vertical shaft. A ladder led up to the next level. It was a sixty-foot climb. The rungs were slick with condensation.

Angelica climbed first. Then Kaelen. Then Aris.

Zephyr stood at the bottom. He grabbed the rung with his right hand. He tried to pull himself up. But the dead weight of his left arm dragged him back down. He couldn't climb. He couldn't lift the gold. It was dragging him into the dark.

"Leave me," he yelled up at them. "I'll slow you down. I can't make it. Just go!"

Ria looked down from the top. "Yes. You will."

She started to turn away. "He's right. He's dead weight. We cut him loose. It's the only logical choice. We can't carry him. He's broke."

#### Scene 4: The Refusal

"No!" Lisbet shouted. She was small, but she blocked Ria's path. "We don't leave people! Not again! We left Hatcher's flask, we left the books, we're not leaving Zephyr!"

"He's broke, Lisbet," Ria said. "He's out of the game. He can't pay his way."

"He saved me at the Banquet!" Lisbet screamed. "I haven't forgotten! We carry him! Or I stay too!"

She grabbed a coil of rope from Hatcher's pack. She threw one end down to Zephyr.

"Tie it around your waist, you idiot!" she yelled. "And don't you dare let go!"

Zephyr tied it with his teeth and his one good hand. He looked up, tears streaking the grime on his face. He had spent his whole life buying people, and now, when he was penniless, someone was buying him. The rope cut into his waist, a lifeline that felt like a noose. The fiber burned against his skin, a sharp reminder that he was alive and dependent.

"Heave!" Lisbet ordered.

Angelica, Kaelen, and even Hatcher grabbed the rope. They pulled. It was heavy. Zephyr scraped against the wall, grunting in pain as his dead arm banged against the rungs. Inch by inch, they hauled him up. It took twenty minutes. His shoulder screamed in protest.

"You're heavier than you look," Hatcher grunted as they pulled him over the lip.

"It's the gold," Zephyr gasped. "It's heavy."

"It's not the gold, kid," Hatcher said. "It's the guilt. And the ego. Drop those, and you'll climb faster. We all carry baggage, but yours is plated."

When he reached the top, he collapsed, gasping. He looked at his arm. It was scratched, dull, and lifeless.

"I am bankrupt," he whispered, staring at the ceiling. "I am bankrupt in every way that matters. I can't pay you back for this. I have nothing."

"Put it on your tab," Lisbet said, patting his cheek. "Interest is compounding. You owe us your life now. And that's expensive."

Zephyr tried to laugh, but it came out as a sob. "I hate interest."

"Then stop borrowing," Lisbet said. "And start paying attention."

Zephyr looked at Lisbet. "My first job," he said, staring at his dead arm. "I was twelve. I stole a loaf of bread. They took a finger. I swore I'd never be small again. I'd never be the one losing parts. Now look at me. I'm smaller than ever."

"You're still small," Lisbet said gently. "But you're loud. That counts for something."

"The loud ones get eaten first," Hatcher said, taking his flask back. "Drink up, kid. It's going to be a long night. And your arm smells like copper and shame."

### Chapter 15: The Battery

#### Scene 1: The Find

They were scavenging a maintenance closet in Sector 5. It was a bust. Empty shelves, stripped wires. The place had been picked clean.

But Angelica, using her mechanic's eye, noticed a loose panel in the back of a drone charging station. She pried it open with her knife.

Inside was a **Resonance Battery**.

It was old, dusty, but the indicator light was a faint, steady green. It glowed in the dark like a radioactive emerald.

"Fifteen percent charge," she announced, holding it up like a holy grail. "Standard Zenith output. Universal connector. This is gold. This is better than gold."

Just then, a scavenger jumped out from behind a crate. He had a knife. He lunged for the battery. He was thin, desperate, his eyes wide with madness.

Hatcher didn't hesitate. He swung his rifle like a club, cracking the man's jaw. The scavenger fell, unconscious.

"Mine," Hatcher growled. "Finders keepers."

"We check his pockets," Ria said. "He might have another."

They checked. Nothing. Just a picture of a girl. They left him there. The picture fluttered to the ground, a reminder of what they were all losing. The body was just a heap of rags now.

#### Scene 2: The Choice

It was a miracle. But it was a small miracle. It wasn't enough to power everything.

They had a choice.

Aris stepped forward. He looked at the battery with hungry eyes. "We need heat. The portable heater unit draws significant power. That battery could give us 12 hours of warmth. Without it, Kaelen will go into shock within four hours. His core temperature is critical. His anemia makes him vulnerable."

Zephyr looked up from the floor. He pointed to his dead arm. "It fits my port. I could... I could charge the arm. I could shoot again. We need defense. If the Blighted come, heat won't save us. A heater can't kill a monster."

Ria looked at Zephyr, then at Kaelen. "Heat," she said. "We are freezing. The gun is useless if we're frozen solid. Logic dictates survival first, defense second. Kaelen is dying."

Hatcher shook his head. "We're walking into Blighted territory. We need firepower. The kid's arm is a cannon. I vote for the gun. I'd rather be cold and armed than warm and dead."

Aris tried to grab the battery. "You are being irrational! The probability of hypothermia is 100%. The probability of attack is variable! I am calculating the exact odds. Without heat, we have a 90% casualty rate by morning. With the gun, we increase survival against a horde by 15%."

Ria shoved him back. "Don't touch it, Doc. I don't care about your math."

It was a standoff. Survival vs. Defense. Warmth vs. Weapons. They stood in a circle, the battery glowing between them.

"We vote," Angelica said. "Ria?"

"Heat."

"Hatcher?"

"Gun."

"Lisbet?"

"Heat," Lisbet whispered. "I'm so cold."

"Aris?"

"Heat. Obviously."

"Zephyr?"

"Gun," Zephyr said. "Please."

It was tied. It was up to Angelica.

"This is ridiculous," Aris said. "Democracy is inefficient in a crisis. Give me the battery. I will allocate the joules."

"You'll allocate it to your own suit," Ria snarled.

"Perhaps," Aris admitted. "But I am the most valuable asset."

"Let's test it," Angelica said. She plugged the battery into a small flashlight. It flared brightly, then popped.

"It's unstable," Aris noted. "Voltage spikes. It might fry the arm."

"I'll take the risk," Zephyr said. "Anything is better than this."

#### Scene 3: The Audit

Angelica held the battery. She felt the warmth of it. She looked at Ria, shivering, rusting. She looked at Kaelen, his lips blue. He looked like a corpse already.

Then she looked at Zephyr. He looked broken. Not just physically, but spiritually. He was a man defined by his utility, and he had none. He was fading faster than Kaelen. If he didn't get his arm back, he would give up. He would lie down and die.

She made a decision. It wasn't about logic. It was about morale. It was about saving a soul, not just a body.

She walked over to Zephyr. She grabbed his dead arm. She popped the charging port on the wrist.

"Angelica, no!" Ria shouted. "We need heat! Kaelen will die!"

"Kaelen is strong," Angelica said. "Zephyr isn't. If he loses the arm, he loses himself."

"That's sentimental garbage," Aris spat. "Thermal regulation is physics. Sentimentalism gets people killed."

"Then we die warm inside," Angelica said. "But Zephyr needs to feel useful. If we lose him, we lose the scout. We lose the eyes."

Angelica jammed the battery in.

#### Scene 4: The Tension

*Hummmmm.*

The arm whirred to life. The brass gears spun. The lights on the forearm flickered on, a bright, defiant gold. The dead weight became a living weapon.

Zephyr gasped. He flexed his fingers. The servos whined. He stood up, the weight gone, replaced by power. He looked at his hand as if seeing it for the first time. The counter on his wrist lit up. *CHARGE: 15%.*

He looked at Angelica, his eyes wide. "Why?"

Ria stared at Angelica with hate. "You chose the thief over the soldier. You chose him over the group. We're going to freeze because you have a soft spot for the criminal."

Angelica stood up. She looked Ria in the eye.

"He has a gun," Angelica said, her voice hard. "You just have an attitude. We need both, but his needs batteries. Yours just needs you to stop complaining. We move fast to stay warm. Zephyr takes point. Use the arm to blast open the sealed vents. We're going down to the core. That's where the heat is."

Zephyr racked the slide on his arm-cannon. He grinned, and for a second, the old rogue was back.

"Yes, Ma'am," he said. "Let's heat things up."

Ria spat on the floor. "I hope you're right, Vance. Because if Kaelen dies, I'm using that arm to dig his grave."

Aris watched them, shaking his head. "Inefficient," he muttered. "Highly inefficient." But he followed them down into the dark.
