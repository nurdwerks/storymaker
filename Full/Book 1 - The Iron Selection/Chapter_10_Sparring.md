# Chapter 10: Sparring

The Dojo was less a place of learning and more a place of ritualized trauma.

It was a vast, circular arena sunk twenty feet into the bedrock of the Spire’s lower militarized zone. The floor was covered in black sand imported from the volcanic flats of Sector 7—a coarse, abrasive grit that didn't just cushion falls but scrubbed the skin raw. The air was perpetually superheated, pumped in from the massive vents that lined the upper gallery, smelling of recycled sweat, ozone, and the coppery tang of dried blood.

The lighting was oppressive. Twelve massive halogen floods hung from the domed ceiling, arranged in a perfect circle to eliminate shadows in the center of the ring. It left nowhere to hide. Every flinch, every drop of blood, every moment of hesitation was illuminated for the hundreds of cadets watching from the tiered observation decks.

Angelica stood in the holding pen for Squad Iron, clutching the wire mesh fence that separated them from the main floor. The pen was cramped, a concrete box that smelled of unwashed bodies, fear, and the cheap rubber of their sparring boots. While the Gold and Silver squads had cushioned benches, hydration stations, and digital tactical displays in their designated viewing areas, Squad Iron stood on bare concrete. They huddled together like livestock awaiting the butcher.

"It's a meat grinder today," Jax whispered from beside her.

He was huge, even for a laborer—a slab of muscle and bone bred for heavy lifting in the shipyards. But today, he looked small. He kept rubbing his left shoulder, where a bruise from yesterday's 'lesson' was blossoming into a sickly yellow-black galaxy. His hands, usually steady as rocks, were trembling slightly.

"Did you see what they did to Miller?" he asked, his voice barely audible over the roar of the crowd. "Dislocated his hip. Instructor Krell didn't even stop the match. He just... watched. Taking notes while Miller screamed. He said the screaming was 'auditory data'."

Angelica tightened her grip on the fence until her knuckles turned white. "They're weeding us out," she said, her eyes fixed on the center of the arena. "They don't want forty Iron cadets. They want five. Maybe less. They want the ones who enjoy it."

"I heard they want zero," Ria said.

Ria was leaning against the back wall of the pen, arms crossed over her chest. She looked bored. While everyone else in the pen was vibrating with anxiety, shifting their weight and checking their gear, Ria looked like she was waiting for a delayed train. Her eyes, dark and sharp, scanned the crowd with a predator's detachment.

"They want us to quit," Ria continued, her voice flat. "It's cheaper. A discharge requires paperwork, severance pay, a transport ticket back to the Silt. A resignation? That's free. They push us until we break, until we beg to go home to the mud. It's an economic strategy, not a pedagogical one."

"I'm not going back," Angelica whispered. It was a vow she made every morning when she woke up in a clean bed, even if that bed was hard and the room was cold. "I'd rather let them break me than go back to the filters."

"Careful what you wish for, Angie," Ria murmured. "Broken things down here don't get fixed. They get recycled."

In the center of the arena, two Silver cadets were finishing their bout. The violence was precise, calculated, and terrifying.

One was a lanky boy with pale skin and eyes that glowed with a faint, electric blue light—a Storm-Caller. He moved with a jerky, frantic speed, static electricity crackling around his fists. His opponent was a girl from Squad Bronze, a heavy-set fighter wielding a practice staff.

The Storm-Caller feinted left, then lunged. He didn't punch; he discharged. He slapped his open palm against the girl's chest plate.

_CRACK._

A bolt of blue lightning arced from his hand. The sound was like a whip cracking, sharp and deafening.

The Bronze girl flew backward. She didn't stumble; she was launched. She hit the black sand ten feet away, rolling to a stop near the electrostatic barrier. She tried to get up, but her limbs twitched uncontrollably, the residual current seizing her muscles.

"Point, Valeris," Instructor Krell’s voice boomed over the PA system. Useable feedback whined for a second before cutting out.

Krell stood on a hovering platform ten feet above the center of the ring. He was a veteran of the Border Wars, a man whose body was a roadmap of violence. Half his face was scar tissue, shiny and hairless. His right leg was a crude cybernetic replacement—not the sleek, vat-grown limbs the rich could afford, but a heavy, piston-driven antique that hissed and clanked every time he shifted his weight.

He looked down at the twitching girl with mild disinterest.

"Failure to ground," Krell noted, typing something into his datapad. "You saw the charge building, Cadet. You didn't brace. You didn't earth yourself. Now you are twitching on the floor like a electrocuted frog. Pathetic."

He looked up, scanning the holding pens. His cybernetic eye, a glowing red lens, whirred as it focused.

"Next pair," Krell barked. "Squad Iron. Entity Ward. Entity Toro. Center."

Angelica's stomach dropped. It felt like she had swallowed a stone.

"Toro?" Jax hissed, his eyes widening. "That's a death sentence. The guy used to bend rebar for fun in the Foundry District. He's not a cadet; he's a construction vehicle with a pulse."

"I'll be fine," Angelica lied. Her voice sounded thin, reedy, like a dry leaf scraping against pavement.

She pushed off the fence. The gate to the pen buzzed open.

"Don't let him grapple you," Ria advised, pushing off the wall. She stepped close to Angelica, her voice low. "He's top-heavy. If he grabs you, he'll crush you. He likes to bear-hug. Stay outside. Hit the knees. Move constantly. If you stop, you die."

"Thanks," Angelica muttered. "Comforting."

"Just telling you the truth," Ria said. "Don't try to win. Just try to survive the clock."

Angelica walked out onto the black sand.

The heat hit her instantly. It was a physical weight, heavy and suffocating. It wrapped around her, pressing the air out of her lungs. The sand shifted under her boots, loose and treacherous. It wasn't firm ground; it was a trap.

Toro was already there.

He was a behemoth. Six-foot-four, with shoulders that blocked out the lights from the gallery. He weighed at least two hundred and forty pounds, and none of it was fat. He was dense, labor-hardened muscle, built from years of swinging hammers and lifting girders in the Foundry.

He wore the standard-issue grey sparring shorts and tank top, but he had customized them. He had wrapped his hands in unauthorized bronze tape that glinted under the lights. He had a thick neck and a jaw like a shovel. He looked at Angelica the way a boot looks at an ant.

"Look at this," Toro boomed, playing to the crowd. He gestured at Angelica. "They sent me a chew toy."

Laughter rippled through the upper tiers where the Gold and Silver squads sat. It was a cruel, practiced sound.

"Combat parameters," Krell intoned from above, ignoring the taunt. "Unarmed. Victory conditions: Knockout, submission, or ring-out. Begin."

Toro didn't wait.

He launched himself forward. For a man his size, he was terrifyingly fast. He moved like a landslide—unstoppable, inevitable. The sand exploded under his feet.

Angelica didn't think; she reacted. It was the Silt instinct. _Big thing coming. Move._

She ducked left, sliding on the sand. Toro's fist—a hammer blow meant to shatter her collarbone—whistled through the space where her head had been a microsecond before. Useable wind buffeted her face, stinging her eyes.

"Slippery," Toro grunted, pivoting on one foot.

He swung a backhand. A lazy, dismissive swat.

Angelica dropped to her knees. The heavy arm passed over her hair. She saw an opening. His ribs were exposed as he overextended.

She drove her fist into his side.

She put everything she had into it—her hip rotation, her shoulder, her desperation.

It was like punching a blast door.

The impact jarred her wrist all the way to the elbow. A shockwave of pain shot up her arm. She felt the small bones in her hand grind together.

Toro didn't even flinch. He didn't gasp. He just looked down at her, a cruel, wide smile spreading across his face.

"Was that a hit?" he asked genuinely. "Or a high-five?"

He didn't bother with technique. He just kicked.

His shin caught her in the thigh. It wasn't a clean hit, but the force of it lifted her off the ground. She spun in the air, crashing into the sand five feet away. The grit tore at her skin, scraping her elbows raw. The breath left her lungs in a painful _whoosh_.

"Get up, Silt-Rat!" someone yelled from the Silver gallery. "Stop playing in the dirt!"

Angelica scrambled to her feet, limping instantly. Her leg felt dead, a numb block of wood dragging in the sand. Every step sent a jolt of fire up her hip.

Toro was walking toward her. He wasn't rushing anymore. He was stalking. He was enjoying it.

"You don't belong here," he said, his voice low enough that only she could hear. "You think because you found some broken toy in the trash, you're one of us? You're nothing. You're spare parts."

He lunged.

Angelica tried to sidestep, but her bad leg buckled. She stumbled.

Toro caught her.

His hand—massive, calloused, smelling of iron and grease—wrapped around her throat. He lifted her off the ground with one hand.

She clawed at his wrist, her fingernails tearing at the bronze tape. Her legs kicked uselessly in the air. He squeezed.

It wasn't a choke; it was a crush. He was compressing her windpipe. Black spots danced in her vision. The noise of the crowd faded into a high-pitched ringing.

"Submit," Toro growled. "Beg me."

angelica couldn't beg. She couldn't breathe. She stared into his eyes—small, dark beads of malice—and saw no mercy there. He wanted to hurt her. He wanted to break her.

"Point, Toro," Krell called out lazily. "Release the candidate."

Toro didn't release. He tightened his grip.

Angelica's vision began to tunnel. Her lungs burned. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, dying bird. Panic, cold and reptilian, uncoiled in her gut.

"Release!" Krell ordered, sharper this time. "Compliance or disqualification!"

Toro sneered. "Fine."

He didn't just drop her; he threw her.

He hurled her like a sack of refuse. Angelica flew through the air, flailing. She crashed into the electrostatic barrier at the edge of the ring.

_CRACK._

The barrier discharged. A bolt of blue lightning arced through her body. It was a non-lethal setting, designed for discipline, but it felt like being dipped in boiling oil. Every muscle in her body seized. Her teeth clacked together.

She hit the sand, convulsing, smoke curling from her uniform.

"Oops," Toro said, wiping his hands on his shorts. "Slipped. My hands were sweaty."

The buzzer sounded.

Angelica lay on the sand, gasping, trying to remember how to tell her lungs to expand. The world was a blur of bright lights and black grit. She tasted blood.

"Winner: Toro," Krell announced. "Medic drone to Sector 4. Next pair."

Two low-level medical bots hovered over, their grabber-arms extending to drag her out of the ring. Their pincers were cold.

Angelica swatted them away. "I can... walk."

She couldn't, really. She stumbled back toward the pen, her leg dragging, her throat burning. Her squad mates stepped back as she entered, giving her a wide berth. They looked at her with a mix of pity and disgust.

Only Ria moved forward. She caught Angelica as she sagged against the fence.

"Sit down," Ria ordered, pushing her onto the concrete. "Breathe through your nose. Don't swallow the blood; you'll throw up."

"He..." Angelica coughed, spitting pink saliva onto the floor. "He's solid. I hit him... barely felt it."

"He's calcium and water," Ria corrected. "Everything breaks. You just tried to break him the hard way."

"Squad Iron," Krell’s voice boomed again. "Entity Ria. Entity Toro. Center."

Toro was still in the ring. He hadn't left. He was flexing his arms for the gallery, basking in the applause.

Ria stood up.

She didn't crack her knuckles. She didn't bounce on her toes. She didn't yell or hype herself up. She just walked out of the gate.

"Be careful," Angelica whispered.

Ria didn't look back. She walked onto the sand, her boots sinking slightly with each heavy, deliberate step. She stopped five feet from Toro. She was five-ten, tall for a girl, but Toro towered over her by half a foot and outweighed her by eighty pounds.

"Another one?" Toro laughed, turning to face her. "What is this, ladies night? Send me the big guy. Send me Jax."

"I'm here," Ria said. Her voice was flat. Monotone.

"You're in my way," Toro sneered. "Move or be moved."

He threw a jab. It was lazy. He expected her to flinch. He expected her to be like Angelica—fast, scared, desperate.

Ria didn't flinch. She took the hit.

The fist connected with her shoulder. _Thud._

She didn't move. She didn't even rock back on her heels. She stood like a statue rooted in the earth.

Toro frowned. He pulled his hand back, shaking it slightly. "You made of wood or something?"

"Steel," Ria said.

The air around her seemed to shimmer. It wasn't a visual distortion like heat haze; it was a textural shift. Her skin, normally a pale olive, began to darken. A grey, metallic sheen rippled across her arms and neck. It wasn't armor plating; it was her skin _becoming_ metal. The pores vanished. The softness hardened. The light reflected off her cheekbones.

The Steel-Hide. A Class-3 somatic mutation. Rare. Painful.

Toro saw it. His eyes narrowed. "Freak."

He wound up for a haymaker. He put his hips into it, a blow meant to shatter a jaw.

Ria watched it come. She waited until the last possible fraction of a second.

Then she stepped _in_.

She stepped inside his guard, taking the space he needed to generate power. She caught his fist.

Not his wrist. His fist.

She wrapped her hand around his massive, taped knuckles. Her fingers, now the color of gunmetal, clamped down.

_CRUNCH._

The sound was distinct. It sounded like a bag of marbles being stepped on. It echoed in the silence.

Toro screamed.

He tried to pull away, but Ria was anchored. She held his crushed hand, staring into his eyes with a terrifying lack of emotion.

"You like breaking things," she said. It wasn't a question.

She twisted.

She rotated his arm outward, working against the joint. She kept twisting. Toro's body was forced to follow the torque. He dropped to his knees, howling, his other hand clawing at her arm, trying to pry her grip loose. It was like trying to pry open a hydraulic press.

"Stop!" Krell shouted. "Point, Ria! Release!"

Ria didn't look at Krell. She looked at Toro.

"My friend," she said, nodding toward the pen where Angelica sat bleeding. "She breaks easily. I don't."

She squeezed one last time. Toro shrieked, a high, thin sound that didn't belong in a body that big.

Then she released him.

Toro collapsed into the fetal position, cradling his hand to his chest. His fingers were mangled, bent at impossible angles. The bronze tape was shredded.

Ria turned and walked away. As she walked, the grey sheen faded from her skin, retreating like a tide, leaving her flesh soft and pink again.

The arena was silent. Even Krell looked impressed.

---

The Medic Bay was less a hospital and more a repair shop.

It smelled of antiseptic, burnt skin, and lubricant. Rows of bio-beds lined the walls, each one occupied by a groaning cadet. Drones hovered overhead, dispensing painkillers and spray-skin bandages with mechanical efficiency.

Angelica sat on a bed in the corner, a gel-pack strapped to her thigh and a vocal regenerator humming against her throat. The device vibrated, stimulating cell growth in her bruised larynx. It tickled, a strange contrast to the deep, throbbing ache in her hip.

Across the aisle, Toro was screaming as a med-droid re-set his fingers. The sound was gruesome, a wet popping noise followed by a sharp intake of breath.

Ria sat in the chair next to Angelica, reading an old, water-damaged magazine about hover-car engine maintenance. She looked completely relaxed. Her uniform was pristine.

"How often do you do that?" Angelica asked, her voice raspy and deep from the swelling. She sounded like she had been gargling gravel. "The skin thing."

"As little as possible," Ria said, flipping a page.

"Does it hurt?"

Ria stopped reading. She lowered the magazine and looked at Angelica. Her eyes were dark, unreadable pools.

"Turning it on doesn't hurt," she said softly. "Turning it on feels... safe. Like closing a heavy door and locking it. Nothing can touch you. You don't feel heat. You don't feel cold. You don't feel pain. You don't feel anything."

She looked at her hands, flexing her long fingers.

"Turning it off," she whispered. "That's the bitch."

"Why?"

"Because the feeling comes back," Ria said. "And it comes back all at once. Every nerve ending wakes up screaming. The air against your skin feels like sandpaper. Your clothes feel like wire wool. It's like being skinned alive for about ten minutes."

She looked at Toro, who was whimpering now as the drone wrapped his hand in a stasis cast.

"That's the Numbness Sacrifice," she said. "To be unbreakable, you have to agree to stop feeling. You give up the soft things—silk, water, a lover's touch. When I'm like that, a kiss feels like a stone pressing against a wall. But a knife feels like a feather."

She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees.

"You're soft, Angie. I don't mean that as an insult. I mean you have porous boundaries. You feel everything. You bleed when the wind blows. You bruise when the world pushes you."

"I know," Angelica muttered, looking down at her bruised legs. "I'm not built for this. I'm a mechanic. I'm supposed to be fixing engines, not dodging them."

"No one is built for this," Ria said. "We're forged. That's why you need the machine. The bird. That's your armor. I have my skin. You have the gryphon. Don't be ashamed of using it. In this place, fair fights are for corpses. If you fight fair, you end up like Toro."

"Toro fought dirty," Angelica pointed out.

"Toro fought stupid," Ria corrected. "He played with his food. He wanted an audience. Don't play, Angie. If you're going to fight, end it. Break it so it can't be fixed."

Angelica looked at her friend. Ria was nineteen, but in that moment, she looked ancient. She looked like a statue that had seen civilizations rise and fall.

"Is that what you did?" Angelica asked. "Did you break something?"

Ria picked up her magazine again. "I broke everything," she said. "Now hush. I'm reading about fuel injectors."

---

The locker room was a sauna.

Steam billowed from the communal showers, thick and opaque, smelling of industrial soap and the damp concrete of the drainage grates. The noise of the water hitting the tile floor was a deafening roar that drowned out conversation. It was a place of vulnerability. Nakedness.

Angelica stood at a sink in the far corner, fully dressed, splashing cold water on her face. The shock of the cold helped clear the fog in her head. She looked at herself in the polished metal mirror.

She looked wrecked.

Her lip was split. Her left eye was swollen shut. Her neck was circled by a dark purple bruise—a necklace of fingerprints left by Toro.

She looked like a victim. She hated it. She hated the weakness staring back at her.

"Pull it together," she whispered to her reflection. "You're a mechanic. You fix broken things. Fix this."

She shut off the tap.

Silence returned to the corner of the room, heavy and wet.

She turned to leave.

Three figures stepped out of the steam, blocking the row of lockers that led to the exit.

It was Toro’s friends. The "Foundry Boys."

They weren't as big as Toro, but they were big enough. Thick necks, shaved heads, eyes hard with loyalty and stupidity. They wore towels around their waists, their chests gleaming with sweat and steam.

"Going somewhere, Silt?" the one in the middle asked. He was a Silver cadet, surprisingly. He had a welding scar running through his eyebrow.

Angelica backed up. Her back hit the cold tile wall. "Session's over. Krell dismissed us."

"Krell isn't here," the boy said, taking a step forward. "And neither is your metal guardian angel. She's in the mess hall getting extra rations."

He cracked his knuckles. It was such a cliché, but in the echoing locker room, it sounded like a gunshot.

"Toro's hand is ruined," the boy continued. "He might wash out. If he washes out, he goes back to the slag pits. You know what the life expectancy is in the pits? Five years. The fumes melt your lungs."

"I didn't break his hand," Angelica said, her voice trembling despite her best efforts. "Ria did."

"No. You just started the fight," the boy said, shaking his head. "You stood there and looked weak. You invited it. And then you let your dog finish it."

"She's not a dog," Angelica snapped.

"Doesn't matter," the boy said. He reached into his locker and pulled out a length of heavy rubber hose. A "correction tool." "We can't touch the Metal-Head. She's too hard; we'd break our hands. But you... you're soft. We're going to leave a mark on you for every bone she broke."

They moved in. A wall of muscle and malice.

Angelica looked left. Lockers. Right. Wall. Forward. Them.

She was trapped.

Fear spiked in her chest—a hot, jagged shard of ice. Her heart hammered against her ribs. She remembered the Silt. She remembered the gangs who would corner her in the ventilation shafts, demanding her day's salvage. She remembered the helpless, suffocating feeling of being small in a world of giants.

She closed her eyes, waiting for the first blow. She waited for the pain.

_No._

The thought wasn't hers. It was deeper. It was older. It came from the base of her spine.

_No more._

Something clicked in her chest. Not a bone. A gear.

The fear didn't vanish. It _compressed_. It collapsed in on itself, becoming dense, heavy, and hot. It transformed from panic into indignation.

Who were they? Who were these meat-sacks to threaten her? She had climbed the Node 42 incinerator shaft. She had repaired a Class-X Chrono-Gryphon with a soldering iron and a prayer. She was a mechanic. She fixed things.

And these boys were broken. They were glitches in the system.

Angelica looked up.

Her eyes, usually a dark, muddy brown, flared. A ring of violet light ignited around her pupils.

"Get out of my way," she said.

The voice didn't sound like hers. It didn't sound raspy or weak. It sounded like two stones grinding together deep underground. It resonated in the tile room, vibrating against the metal lockers.

The leader hesitated. He blinked. "Or what?" he laughed nervously, raising the hose. "You gonna cry? You gonna call for mommy?"

He swung.

Angelica didn't flinch. She didn't duck.

She screamed.

"NO!"

It wasn't a word. It was a trigger.

She threw her hands out, palms forward.

She didn't touch them. She didn't have to.

The air in front of her distorted. It rippled, like the surface of a pond struck by a boulder. A transparent sphere of force expanded from her center of mass.

_BOOM._

It was the sound of a vacuum sealing, loud and hollow. The steam in the room was instantly blasted away, leaving a clear circle of visibility.

The three boys were lifted off their feet. Not pushed—_launched_.

The laws of physics suspended their argument with gravity. The boys flew backward, their limbs flailing in slow motion. They traveled ten feet. Fifteen feet. Twenty.

They slammed into the wall of lockers on the far side of the room.

_CLANG-CRASH._

The metal lockers caved in. Doors buckled and flew off their hinges. The heavy steel crumpled like tin foil. The boys slid down the ruined metal, hitting the floor in a heap of groans and tangled limbs.

The rubber hose dropped from the leader's hand, rolling across the tile floor to stop at Angelica's feet.

Silence. Absolute, ringing silence.

The steam began to curl back into the vacuum left by the blast, forming a vortex around Angelica.

She stood there, her hands still raised, her chest heaving. She looked at her palms. They were glowing. Faint, purple veins of energy were tracing their way up her wrists, fading as she watched.

She looked at the boys. They weren't moving. One of them was groaning, clutching his ribs.

"I..." Angelica whispered.

She backed away. She turned and ran. She burst out of the locker room doors, leaving the ruins of her anger behind her.

---

High above, in the Observation Deck, the monitor wall was silent.

Prelate Vane stood with his hands clasping the railing, staring down at the holographic replay of the locker room feed. The room was dark, lit only by the ghostly blue glow of the screens.

The footage was grainy, obscured by the steam, but the energy signature was clear. A spike. A massive, jagged spike of violet data that went off the charts.

"Kinetic Displacement," Vane murmured. "Level 5. Maybe 6. That is... significant."

Dr. Aris stood beside him, his cybernetic eye whirring as he analyzed the frame-by-frame data. He was tapping commands into a floating console with terrifying speed.

"She didn't use a focus," Aris noted, his voice a mechanical drone. "No wand. No somatic component. No incantation. She didn't even use a verbal command until the release."

"And?" Vane asked.

"And she is a Null," Aris said. "Nulls cannot channel ambient aether. They have no conduit. This energy didn't come from the environment, Prelate. It came from her."

"Emotional trigger," Vane said, nodding. "Fear converted to kinetic energy. Bio-feedback. It's crude. It's inefficient. It's dangerous."

He smiled. A cold, thin smile.

"And it's magnificent."

"She caused significant property damage," Aris pointed out, highlighting the ruined lockers on the screen. "Three concussions. Two fractured ribs. And the locker unit is a total loss. Maintenance will file a grievance."

"Bill it to the Foundry District," Vane said, waving a hand dismissively. "They breed them tough; they'll heal. And buy new lockers. Better ones."

He rewound the footage. He watched the moment of impact again. The way the air warped. The way the force didn't just push, but _erased_ the space between her and them.

"She isn't just a Mechanic, Aris," Vane said softly. "She's a Battery. She generated that pulse without drawing from the Spire's grid. She pulled it from somewhere else. She created something from nothing."

"That violates the First Law of Thermodynamics," Aris said.

"Then the First Law is wrong," Vane said. "Or she is an exception to it."

He turned away from the screen, walking back toward his desk. He picked up an ancient book, one bound in what looked like charred leather. **The History of Ash**.

"Do you know why the Artificers were purged, Aris?" Vane asked, running his hand over the cover.

"Because they were heretics," Aris recited. "They sought to replace God with gears."

"That is the Sunday School answer," Vane said. "The truth is simpler. They were purged because they found a way to generate infinite energy. They discovered the Resonance. The 'Deep Noise' that underpins reality."

He opened the book. The pages were blank, scorched black by some intense heat.

"They found that if you stress a soul enough—if you compress it with fear, grief, and rage—it doesn't break. It goes critical. It becomes a reactor."

He looked back at the screen, at the frozen image of Angelica Ward screaming.

"The Artificers built machines to harvest that energy. The Gryphons. The Engines. But they needed a spark. They needed a pilot who could survive the initial ignition."

"And you think Ward is that pilot?" Aris asked.

"I think she is the kindling," Vane corrected. "The Gryphon is the match. We just need to provide the friction."

"She is unstable," Aris warned. "If she goes critical in the dorms..."

"Then we will have a very expensive crater," Vane said. "But if she succeeds? If she learns to control it?"

He closed the book with a snap.

"Then we will have the power to relight the sun."

"How do we proceed?" Aris asked. "Do we contain her?"

"No," Vane said. "We cultivate her. Stress equals growth. I want you to increase her workload. Put her in the simulation rotation. Isolate her from the others. Make her feel alone. Make her feel afraid."

"And the Gryphon?"

"Let her keep it," Vane said. "It is the catalyst. It is the key to the lock."

"And if she breaks?" Aris asked. "If the pressure cracks the vessel?"

Vane sat down in his chair, picking up a glass of wine. He looked at the red liquid, swirling it in the light.

"Then we find another battery," he said. "The Silt is full of rats."

---

Angelica didn't stop running until she reached the lowest level of the dorms. She found a maintenance closet, slipped inside, and locked the door.

She slid down the wall, sitting in the dark among the mops and buckets. The closet smelled of bleach and dust.

She held her hands up. They were shaking. The glow was gone, but the heat remained. Her skin felt feverish, buzzing with a static charge that made the hair on her arms stand up.

She closed her eyes.

She could still feel it. The push. The moment when the world had bent to her will. It hadn't felt like magic. Magic was reciting words and waving sticks. This felt like... physics. It felt like she had reached into the engine of the world and tightened a screw.

It was terrifying.

And god help her, it felt good.

It felt like power.

For the first time in her life, she wasn't the scrap. She wasn't the refuse. She was the hammer.

She clenched her fists.

"I'm not broken," she whispered to the darkness.

The darkness answered with a memory.

She was back in the Silt. The Rust Gardens of Node 42.

It wasn't a garden; it was a graveyard of giants. Millions of tons of discarded machinery, dumped from the Spire above, lay rotting in the acidic mud. It was a maze of rusted gears the size of houses, tangled wires like copper vines, and the skeletal remains of ships that had flown too close to the atmosphere's edge.

The air smelled of ozone and wet decay. The sky was a bruised purple, choked by the smog layer that separated the Silt from the sunlight.

She was twelve years old, small and starving, climbing through the ribcage of a fallen cargo hauler. Her hands were wrapped in rags to protect them from the jagged metal. Her breathing mask was cracked, leaking the bitter taste of sulfur into her mouth.

She was looking for copper. Just enough to trade for a filter cartridge. Just enough to breathe for another week.

Then she found him.

He wasn't buried like the others. He was waiting.

He sat in a crater of fused glass, his gold plating tarnished but unbroken. A Chrono-Gryphon. Model X-7. A relic from the War of the Gears, before the Spire was built. Before the peace was bought with iron.

He was beautiful. Even covered in mud, he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. He wasn't scrap. He was _art_.

She approached him slowly, expecting the automated defenses to vaporize her. But his eyes—those massive, multifaceted emerald lenses—were dark. He was dead.

She touched his flank.

The metal was cold. But when she laid her hand on the chassis, right over the core... she felt it.

A hum.

It was barely there. A vibration so faint it might have been her own pulse. But it was distinct. It was a rhythm.

_Thrum... thrum... thrum..._

The machine wasn't dead. It was sleeping. It was waiting for a wake-up call.

She didn't have tools. She didn't have a power source. She didn't have a manual. All she had was a rusty screwdriver she had found in a corpse's pocket and a desperate, illogical need to see those eyes light up.

She worked for three days. She didn't sleep. She didn't eat. She traced the circuits with her fingers, clearing the mud from the contacts. She spliced the broken wires with strips of her own tunic. She poured her own meager supply of distinct bio-fuel into his reserve tank.

And on the third night, as the acid rain hissed against the metal shell, she found the ignition switch.

It wasn't a button. It was a connection. a gap in the circuit that needed a bridge.

She didn't have a fuse. So she used her hand.

She grabbed the two exposed leads.

Pain. White-hot, blinding pain shot up her arms, seizing her heart. It felt like she was being torn apart. But she didn't let go. She held on. She screamed into the rain, pouring her own life force, her own stubborn refusal to die, into the machine.

_wake up._

And he did.

The emerald eyes flared to life. The gears engaged with a sound like thunder. The wings unfolded, shedding decades of rust and dirt.

He looked at her. He scanned her.

_DESIGNATION: PILOT,_ a voice boomed in her head. Not a speaker. A thought. _STATUS: CRITICAL. AWAITING ORDERS._

"Live," she had whispered, collapsing into the mud. "Just live."

He had wrapped his wings around her, shielding her from the rain. He had kept her warm. He had saved her.

That was the first time she had felt the push. The first time she had realized that she wasn't just a scavenger. She was a conduit. She could bridge the gap between dead things and living things.

And today... today she had done it again. But she hadn't bridged a circuit. She had bridged the air itself.

She looked at her hands now, in the dark closet. They were the same hands that had woken the Gryphon. They were scarred, calloused, and stained with grease. But they held a power she didn't understand.

Vane called it a "Kinetic Manifestation."

Angelica called it survival.

She wasn't going to let them break her. She wasn't going to let them turn her into scrap. She had woken a god in the mud. She could survive a school.

She stood up. The fear was still there, but it was smaller now. It was manageable. It was just another broken part that needed to be worked around.

She unlocked the door.

Somewhere in the distance, a clock chimed the hour.

She stayed there for a long time, listening to the silence, waiting for the monsters to come. But they didn't comes. Only the dust settled around her, like snow on a grave.
