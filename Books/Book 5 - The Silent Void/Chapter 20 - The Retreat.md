## Chapter 20: The Retreat

### Scene 1: The Airlock

- **Key Event:** The Escape.
- **Detailed Description:** The blast door to Sector X grinds closed. It is a slow, agonizing process. The hydraulic pistons hiss, fighting the gravitational distortion radiating from the collapsing singularity inside the sector.
- **Key Event:** The Survivors.
- **Detailed Description:** **Angelica Ward**, **Kaelen Night**, **Ria**, and a handful of shell-shocked scientists stumble into the corridor. They are covered in frost and the grey dust of disintegrated matter. The air in the corridor is thin and freezing.
- **Key Event:** The View.
- **Detailed Description:** Through the narrowing gap, Angelica sees the jungle of Sector X—the strange, mutated plants, the bio-luminescent moss—freezing instantly as the vacuum rushes in. The trees shatter like glass. The "Blue Sun" reactor core implodes, folding in on itself.
- **Key Event:** The Weight.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stops. She feels the weight of **Dr. Aris's** datapad in her pocket. It contains all the research, all the madness. It feels heavy, like a tombstone.
- **Key Event:** The Choice.
- **Detailed Description:** She wonders if she made the right choice, sacrificing the knowledge of Sector X for their lives. She wonders if Aris is still in there, staring into the abyss he created.
- **Key Event:** The Decision.
- **Detailed Description:** She forces herself to turn away. She hits the "Seal" button on the control panel with a fist.
- **Key Event:** The Seal.
- **Detailed Description:** The door slams shut with a definitive _BOOM_. The seal locks. The hissing stops. Sector X is gone.
- **Key Event:** The Order.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at her team.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Secure the door. Sector X is dead. Don't look back. There's nothing there for us anymore."
- **Key Event:** The Leadership.
- **Detailed Description:** She locks her emotions away. It is a Captain's choice—sacrificing the limb to save the body.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She demonstrates the cold pragmatism required of command, compartmentalizing her trauma to focus on the immediate survival of the crew.
- **Key Event:** The Humor.
- **Detailed Description:** **Hatcher** leans against the wall, wheezing.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Nearly us too. That was too close. The math almost ate us. I hate math. Remind me never to visit a library again."

### Scene 2: The Alert

- **Key Event:** The Light.
- **Detailed Description:** As the door seals, the emergency lights in the corridor switch from steady yellow to pulsing red. The "Condition One" alarm begins to wail—a low, rhythmic horn blast that vibrates the deck plates.
- **Key Event:** The Voice.
- **Detailed Description:** The ship's AI voice, no longer glitching but terrifyingly calm, speaks from the overhead speakers.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ship AI:** "Proximity Alert. Multiple contacts detected. Fleet deployment confirmed. Signature match: Class-4 Aggressors. Prey status: Found."
- **Key Event:** The Recognition.
- **Detailed Description:** **General Ironwood** stiffens. He is clutching a cauterized wound on his side where a laser grazed him, but he ignores the pain. He recognizes the sensor profile.
- **Key Event:** The Enemy.
- **Detailed Description:** It is the "Hunters"—the alien race that has been pursuing the _Aeterna_ since the beginning of the voyage, centuries ago. The monsters under the bed.
- **Key Event:** The Fatigue.
- **Detailed Description:** He closes his eyes for a second. He looks old. He has been fighting this war for too long. But then he opens them, and the steel is back.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "They found us. The nebula didn't hide the energy signature of the singularity. We lit a flare in the dark."

### Scene 3: The Repair

- **Key Event:** The Breach.
- **Detailed Description:** A section of the corridor wall buckles inward. The metal groans. A hiss of escaping air signals a micro-fracture caused by the gravity waves.
- **Key Event:** The Alarm.
- **Detailed Description:** The pressure alarm wails. _WARNING: DEPRESSURIZATION IMMINENT._
- **Key Event:** The Crisis.
- **Detailed Description:** If they don't seal it, the corridor will depressurize before they can reach the next bulkhead. They will suffocate in the vacuum.
- **Key Event:** The Action.
- **Detailed Description:** **Lisbet**, the colony's tech expert who usually prefers code to physical labor, steps up. She sees the soldiers hesitating. She grabs a canister of emergency sealant foam from a wall locker.
- **Key Event:** The Fix.
- **Detailed Description:** She pushes past Ironwood. She jams the nozzle into the crack. She pulls the trigger.
- **Key Event:** The Chemistry.
- **Detailed Description:** The grey foam expands rapidly, bubbling and hardening instantly into a concrete-like patch. The hissing stops.
- **Key Event:** The Success.
- **Detailed Description:** She checks the gauge.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Oxygen levels stabilizing. Patch is holding. But it's brittle. We can't take a direct hit here. We need to move."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She overcomes her fear and physical limitations, using her technical knowledge to save the group in a crisis, proving she is more than just a hacker.

### Scene 4: The Plan

- **Key Event:** The Regroup.
- **Detailed Description:** They regroup in the sealed corridor. They check their weapons. Ammo is critical. Energy cells are depleted. They are a ragged group of survivors, covered in dust, blood, and frost.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** The news of the fleet changes everything. There is no more running. The nebula is no longer a sanctuary; it is a trap.
- **Key Event:** The Assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen looks at Angelica. He wipes blood from his sword. He sees the change in her eyes. She isn't the scared girl from the Undercity anymore. She is the Captain.
- **Key Event:** The Loyalty.
- **Detailed Description:** He decides to follow her, not because of her bloodline or the prophecy, but because she kept her head when the world was ending.
- **Key Event:** The Strategy.
- **Detailed Description:** Ironwood racks the slide on his weapon.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "They're here. The Hunters. We can't hide anymore. We're exposed."
- **Key Event:** The Command.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica checks the power level on her shock-gloves.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Then we stop hiding. We go to the bridge. We wake up the big guns—the railguns, the particle beams. Everything."
- **Key Event:** The Escape Plan.
- **Detailed Description:** She taps the pocket with the datapad.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "And we use Aris's star-maps to get out of here. We jump blindly if we have to."
- **Key Event:** The Agreement.
- **Detailed Description:** Ironwood nods. He likes a direct fight.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Now we fight. No more running. I like that plan. Let's make them regret finding us."
- **Key Event:** The Move.
- **Detailed Description:** They move out, heading toward the lift that leads to the Command Deck. Behind them, the patch on the wall groans, but holds.

### Scene 5: The Reinforcements

- **Key Event:** Allies arrive.
- **Detailed Description:** As the group approaches the lift junction, two figures emerge from a side corridor. **Lady Corinne (The Porcelain Doll)** is uncharacteristically disheveled, her silk gown torn and stained with hydraulic fluid. She has been running logistics from the supply depot when the alarms hit. Beside her, **Zephyr (The Gilded Rogue)** limps along, his cybernetic arm sparking intermittently—the gravity fluctuations have damaged his internal systems. Despite his condition, his eyes are still calculating, already running cost-benefit analyses on their escape routes.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "The supply depot is gone. The gravity wave crushed it. But I managed to save the medical kit and the emergency rations. We won't starve before the aliens kill us."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "My arm's at 30% capacity. Can't aim worth a damn. But I can still pick locks. Point me at the bridge access, I'll get us in."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Good. We need everyone. Fall in. We're taking back this ship."
