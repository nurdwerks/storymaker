# Character Profile: Chamberlain Hives

**Archetype:** The Bureaucrat / The Wall
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He derives his sense of self-worth from the power he serves, looking down on all who do not hold a title).
**Virtue Mask:** PROFESSIONALISM (He uses the rules and the schedule to control access and exert power).

## I. Role in the Story

Chamberlain Hives is the administrator of Duke Grey’s estate. He is officious, precise, and manages the Duke’s life with an iron fist, serving as the ultimate gatekeeper.

- **The Gatekeeping:** He frequently tells Angelica that the Duke is "indisposed" or "in a private meeting," effectively cutting off her access and keeping her isolated within the palace.
- **The Hierarchy:** He bows low to Grey but barely nods to Angelica, signaling to the entire household that her position as the Duke's wife holds no real authority.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 15: The Game of Gears](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1270-1290)
- **Defining Quote:** "It was the new AI Chamberlain, efficient and soulless, replacing Hives, who had been scrapped for a scheduling error." (Reveals flaw: PRIDE/DISPOSABILITY)
