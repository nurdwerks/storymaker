## Chapter 26: The Suit Up

### Scene 1: The Armor of the Pilot

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward prepares for the Interface by donning the specialized Interface Suit.
- **Detailed Description:** The prep room adjacent to the Interface Core is small, sterile, and cold. The walls are lined with lockers containing vacuum suits, but the locker Angelica opens contains something different. The Interface Suit hangs there like a flayed skin—a matte-black, liquid-metal garment that looks wet even when dry. It is not clothing; it is a full-body conductor. Angelica strips out of her worn, grease-stained mechanic's jumpsuit. She shivers in the cold air, her skin pale and covered in scars from the Undercity and the Stone Season. She looks at the suit with trepidation. She knows it is designed to bond with her nervous system, to eliminate the barrier between skin and sensor.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels vulnerable. For years, she has hidden behind layers of grease, baggy clothes, and armor. Now, she must be naked to the machine. She traces the scar on her wrist—the Blood Pact with Kaelen. This is another pact, but one written in chrome and data. She is trading her body for power. *I am not a person anymore,* she thinks. *I am a component.*
- **Key Event:** Angelica puts on the suit.
- **Detailed Description:** The suit is cold as it touches her skin, but it warms instantly as it reacts to her body heat. It moves like oil, sliding over her limbs and tightening until it feels like a second skin. It is suffocatingly tight. As the seals close, she gasps. A sharp, stinging sensation ripples across her body as thousands of microscopic sensors extend and press against her pores. It feels like walking into a cloud of static electricity. The suit hums, a low-frequency vibration that syncs with her heartbeat.
- **Key Dialog:** **Angelica Ward:** "It feels... alive. It's like wearing a nervous system."

### Scene 2: The Handmaiden

- **Key Event:** Corinne steps forward to assist Angelica with the final preparations.
- **Detailed Description:** Corinne, usually the picture of useless aristocracy, is surprisingly focused. She pushes aside a nervous technician and takes charge. She picks up a specialized comb and a set of silver clips. "Sit down," she orders, her voice firm but not unkind. Angelica obeys, sitting on a metal stool. Corinne begins to brush Angelica’s hair, which is matted with sweat and oil. Her hands are gentle, a stark contrast to the harsh environment. She separates the strands with precision, preparing to braid them away from the neural ports at the base of Angelica's skull.
- **Character Defining Moment:** **Corinne** — This is Corinne’s moment of redemption. She cannot fight; she cannot fix engines. But she understands presentation. She understands the ritual of dressing for war. She treats this not as a medical procedure, but as a coronation. She is dressing the Queen of the Void. She displays a quiet competence that surprises everyone, especially Angelica.
- **Key Dialog:** **Corinne:** "You can't save the world looking like a mechanic. If you're going to sit on a throne, even an electric one, you need to look the part. Let me fix this."
- **Key Dialog:** **Angelica Ward:** "I didn't think you knew how to braid hair, Corinne. I thought your drones did it."
- **Key Dialog:** **Corinne:** "I learned a lot of things in the dark, Angelica. Hold still."

### Scene 3: The Crown of Wire

- **Key Event:** Corinne finishes the braid and secures the neural jacks.
- **Detailed Description:** Corinne weaves Angelica’s hair into a tight, intricate crown braid that circles her head, leaving the neck and temples completely exposed for the interface nodes. She works quickly, her fingers nimble. She secures the braid with silver clips that look like jewelry but are actually conductive clamps. When she is finished, she steps back. The effect is striking. Angelica looks regal, severe, and dangerous. The black suit creates a stark silhouette, and the braided hair gives her the appearance of a warrior-saint.
- **Key Event:** The suit calibrates.
- **Detailed Description:** A technician activates the calibration sequence. The suit constricts violently. Angelica cries out as the sensors dig deeper, seeking the major nerve clusters. Her back arches. The suit glows with faint blue lines that trace her vascular system. The pain is intense—a burning itch that feels like it’s under her skin.
- **Key Dialog:** **Technician:** "Calibration at 80%. Neural density nominal. Try to relax, Commander. Fighting it makes it hurt more."
- **Key Dialog:** **Angelica Ward:** "Relax? I feel like I'm being eaten by a snake."
- **Key Dialog:** **Corinne:** "Breathe, darling. Beauty is pain. Power is agony. You look... terrifying."
- **Key Dialog:** **Angelica Ward:** "I look like a weapon."
- **Key Dialog:** **Corinne:** "Exactly. Go save the universe."

### Scene 4: The Final Reflection

- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at herself in the polished metal of the airlock door.
- **Detailed Description:** Before leaving the room, Angelica catches her reflection. She barely recognizes herself. The girl from Sector 12 is gone. The mechanic is gone. Staring back at her is a sleek, black-clad avatar of the *Aeterna*. Her eyes are already beginning to reflect the gold of the interface. She stands straighter. The suit supports her muscles, making her feel stronger, faster. She flexes her hands, and the suit ripples. She turns to Corinne.
- **Character Defining Moment:** **Angelica Ward** — She realizes that she has misjudged Corinne. Beneath the vanity and the complaints, there is steel. Corinne didn't run. She stayed to help the only way she knew how. Angelica feels a surge of gratitude. It is the last human connection she will have before the machine takes her.
- **Key Dialog:** **Angelica Ward:** "Thank you, Corinne. For staying. For... this."
- **Key Dialog:** **Corinne:** "Just come back, Angelica. Who else is going to argue with me?"
- **Key Event:** The airlock cycles open.
- **Detailed Description:** Steam hisses as the heavy door slides back. Kaelen is waiting on the other side. He sees her and stops dead. His eyes widen. He sees the transformation. He sees the weapon. Angelica steps through the door, the suit making a soft, hydraulic sound with each movement. She does not look back.

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Scenes:** Break each chapter into component scenes based on location changes, time jumps, or POV shifts.
2. **Key Events:** Bullet point all significant actions, revelations, or plot progressions.
3. **Detailed Description:** This is the primary place to expand the word count. Describe the environment, the sensory details (smell, sound, temperature), and the specific physical actions of the characters.
4. **Internal Conflict:** Add this section where characters are facing difficult choices or emotional turmoil.
5. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
6. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
7. **Flexibility:** Not every key event requires both a defining moment and dialog—include what applies. You may add custom headers (e.g., **The Memory**, **The Calculation**) to better organize complex information.
