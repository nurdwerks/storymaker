## Chapter 21: The Thinning

### Scene 1: The Montage

- **Key Event:** Day 40 in the Arena. The Clockwork City has rusted, gears clogged with sand and blood.

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron has transformed: Angelica is skeletal-thin with sharp cheekbones; Kaelen sleeps in twenty-minute bursts, his uniform shredded but blades polished; Ria is barely human—80% gunmetal skin, Titan-Form now permanent.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Her humanity fades as her Titan-Form becomes her primary state.

### Scene 2: The Betrayal

- **Key Event:** A supply crate lands—one crate of protein bars, water, and ammo. Squad Iron reaches it at the same time as Squad Copper (Jax, Sam, Trent—former classmates).

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Jax:** "Back off, Vance. We saw it first."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "We can split it. Enough for everyone to get one day's rations."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Trent:** "No splitting. We take it all."

- **Key Event:** Sam, who used to lend Angelica her notes, lunges with a glass shard at Angelica's throat out of desperate hunger.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Sam:** "I'm hungry! I'm so hungry!"

### Scene 3: The Execution

- **Key Event:** Ria enters Overload Mode and snaps Jax's neck. Kaelen appears behind Sam—a single strike, silence. Trent surrenders but they cannot carry prisoners.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Ria, don't!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "We cannot carry prisoners."

- **Key Event:** Ria crushes Trent's skull. Angelica vomits bile, then eats the protein bar that cost three souls.

### Scene 4: The Change

- **Key Event:** That night, Angelica tells Kaelen that Ria is "losing it"—turning into a machine based on how she didn't hesitate.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I don't want to survive if I turn into that."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You won't."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "How do you know?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Because you are crying. Machines don't cry."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen catches a tear on his finger and tells her to hold onto it—it separates them from the Chimera.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We aren't students anymore. We're survivors."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Survivors. But what are we surviving for?"
