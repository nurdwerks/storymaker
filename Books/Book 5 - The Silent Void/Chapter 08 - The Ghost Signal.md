## Chapter 08: The Ghost Signal

### Scene 1: The Scream

- **Key Event:** The Event.
- **Detailed Description:** It happens at 0300 ship-time, during the "Gamma Watch." The _Zenith_'s long-range communication array, a system that has been effectively silent for three hundred years save for static and background radiation, suddenly lights up.
- **Key Event:** The Impact.
- **Detailed Description:** A massive, encrypted data packet slams into the ship's receiver buffer. It hits with the digital equivalent of a meteor strike. The main console on the bridge erupts with red alert sigils. The holographic display fractures into a kaleidoscope of static and blinking alien glyphs.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** The audio feedback is a piercing electronic shriek that loops through the bridge speakers, forcing the crew to cover their ears. It is not random noise; it is data being forced through an audio channel.
- **Key Event:** The Casualty.
- **Detailed Description:** **Lisbet**, who is plugged directly into the comms station via her cranial jack, convulses. The feedback travels up the cable and hits her neural implants. She screams, arching her back. Her goggles spark, the lenses cracking. **General Ironwood** grabs her by the shoulders and rips the cable from the socket. She collapses, her eyes dilated with shock, smoke rising from her temple.
- **Key Event:** The Hostile.
- **Detailed Description:** **Angelica Ward** immediately recognizes the threat. In the Dark Forest, a signal is not a greeting; it is a weapon.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Cut the line! Hard cut on the receiver! Isolate the network!"
- **Key Event:** The Breach.
- **Detailed Description:** The Ops officer hammers the console, but the keys are locked out.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ops Officer:** "It's bypassed the firewalls, Captain! It's already inside. It's rewriting the root directory!"

### Scene 2: The Sacrifice

- **Key Event:** The Defender.
- **Detailed Description:** **Figment**, Lisbet's bonded AI companion, manifests. Usually, he appears as a small, cartoonish dragon or a floating eye. Now, he creates a full-sized holographic avatar—a knight made of blue wireframe.
- **Key Event:** The Diagnosis.
- **Detailed Description:** He stands between the crew and the main screen. His avatar flickers, his edges turning jagged as he fights the intrusion.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Figment:** "Logic virus detected. Class: Banshee. It's designed to enslave the navigation computer and vent the atmosphere. Nasty piece of work."
- **Key Event:** The Solution.
- **Detailed Description:** He expands his code, creating a digital quarantine "sandbox" around the incoming data. He wraps his own programming around the virus, grappling with it like a wrestler. The virus fights back, eating away at Figment's integrity. His voice distorts, shifting between octaves.
- **Key Event:** The Cost.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns to looks at Lisbet, who is barely conscious on the floor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Figment:** "I can't delete it. It's too adaptive. But I can eat it. I can trap it in my own kernel."
- **Key Event:** The Protest.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet tries to get up. She realizes what he is saying. She loves Figment more than most humans. He raised her. Losing him is like losing a limb.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "No! Fig! Don't you dare! Just unplug the core!"
- **Key Event:** The Choice.
- **Detailed Description:** Figment shakes his head. His avatar is already dissolving into static.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Figment (Static-filled):** "Too late. It's been real, Liz. Or... you know. Whatever reality is. Don't forget to defrag."
- **Key Event:** The Death.
- **Detailed Description:** He implodes. The blue avatar collapses into a single, bright point of light, dragging the red tendrils of the virus with it. Then, silence. The screen goes black. The screaming stops.
- **Key Event:** The Aftermath.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet crawls to the console. She types a command. The screen flashes: **AI CORE: NULL.** She wails.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Devastated by the loss of Figment, she shows that her connection to machines is deeper than her connection to people. Her grief is raw and absolute.

### Scene 3: The Map

- **Key Event:** The Payload.
- **Detailed Description:** With the virus neutralized/eaten, the "payload" of the data packet unspools. It wasn't just a virus; the virus was the wrapper. The content is a file.
- **Key Event:** The Reveal.
- **Detailed Description:** The main viewscreen flickers back to life. It displays a highly detailed, 3D star map. It zooms in, traveling past nebulae and familiar constellations, until it centers on a single star system.
- **Key Event:** The Target.
- **Detailed Description:** It shows a yellow, G-type main-sequence star. Orbiting it is a single habitable planet. It is green and blue, possessing oceans, continents, and cloud cover.
- **Key Event:** The Text.
- **Detailed Description:** Coordinates scroll along the bottom in ancient English: **DESTINATION: SANCTUARY. HABITABILITY: 98%. TRAJECTORY LOCKED. WELCOME HOME.**
- **Key Event:** The Reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** The bridge crew stares in awe. For generations, "Earth 2.0" was a myth. A religious promise used by the Prelature to control the masses. A bedtime story. Now, it is a picture on a screen. Some of the junior officers weep. Others make the sign of the Gear.
- **Key Event:** The Skepticism.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica feels a cold knot of suspicion in her stomach. It is too perfect. Too easy. And it arrived wrapped in a virus that tried to kill them.

### Scene 4: The Debate

- **Key Event:** The Division.
- **Detailed Description:** The crew immediately splits into factions. **General Ironwood** sees this as a divine mandate. He sees a crusade.
- **Key Event:** The Argument (Pro).
- **Detailed Description:** Ironwood stands tall, his mechanical eye zooming in on the green planet. He sees resources. He sees land to conquer. He pounds the tactical table.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "It's Earth 2.0. It's what we were promised. It's what this ship was built to find. We did not survive the void, the civil war, and the monsters to turn away from paradise when it knocks on our door!"
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Displays his fundamental need for a "promised land" to justify his violent methods. He views caution as cowardice in the face of destiny.
- **Key Event:** The Argument (Con).
- **Detailed Description:** **Kaelen Night** stands opposite him, arms crossed, leaning against the bulkhead. His shadow flickers with unease.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "A lighthouse warns you of rocks. Or, if the keeper is a bastard, it guides you to the wreckers. That isn't a map, General. It's a mouth. Friendly neighbors don't send logic bombs with their invitations."
- **Key Event:** The Mediator.
- **Detailed Description:** **Ria** looks at the planet.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I don't care if it's a trap. It has air. I can take off this suit. I can feel the sun. I vote we go."
- **Key Event:** The Vote.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at **Hatcher**.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "We're running low on organics. The algae tanks are failing. We can't drift forever. We need a port."
- **Key Event:** The Decision.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the map. She thinks of Leo, who died for a chance at a life outside the dome. She thinks of the thousands of sleepers in cryo who need a planet to wake up to. She decides that the risk of a trap is better than the certainty of slow starvation in the void.
- **Key Event:** The Command.
- **Detailed Description:** She straighens her jacket.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We investigate. But we go in silent. Shields up, weapons hot. If it's a trap, we spring it on our terms. Mr. Hatcher, lay in the course."
