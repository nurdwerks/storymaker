**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (She claims her job is the ultimate form of devotion).

## I. Role in the Story

The Royal Taster is a woman whose sole job is to eat the Emperor’s food to check for poison. She is a reminder of the paranoia and fanaticism that surrounds the Throne.

- **The Attitude:** She looks at Angelica with haughty superiority, considering herself more "pure" because of her willingness to die for the Emperor.
- **The Quote:** "I die for him. What do you do?" This question challenges Angelica's worth and reinforces the idea that the court consists only of those who have surrendered their lives to the Emperor.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 30](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md)
- **Defining Quote:** "Left to rot while the hologram ignored her." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: PRIDE/MARTYRDOM FOR NOTHING)
