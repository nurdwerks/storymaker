## I. Role in the Story

The Mirror-Maid is a silent servant who carries a full-length mirror behind Lady Vesper at all times. She exists only to ensure that Vesper is never without a reflection she can approve of.

- **The Function:** She ensures Vesper's "Glass Queen" persona remains intact at every second.
- **The Tactic:** She uses the mirror as a physical weapon of exclusion. She positions it to block Angelica’s view or to catch ambient light and reflect it into Angelica’s eyes, literalizing the idea that the "unwashed" are not fit to look upon the elite.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 23: The Slaughter](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1821-1828)
- **Defining Quote:** "You are cracking the ambiance, darling." (Spoken by Vesper, reveals flaw: SLOTH/ERASURE)
