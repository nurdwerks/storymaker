# Character Profile: Old Man Rust

**Archetype:** The Fossil / The Memory of Silt
**True Sin:** SLOTH (He has surrendered to the decay, believing that nothing can ever truly change).
**Virtue Mask:** WISDOM (He frames his cynicism as "Ancient Truth").

## I. Role in the Story

Old Man Rust is an elderly Silt-dweller who remembers the "Before Times" before the Silt was deep. He represents the living history of the Silt and its slow, grinding despair.

- **The Despair:** He shares stories of his youth with Hatcher, stories that emphasize how much has been lost to the Zenith above.
- **The Warning:** He looks at Angelica with pity, calling her "The girl who thinks she's a person." This dismissal is a crushing blow to Angelica’s self-worth, delivered by someone who has already given up on the world.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Absolute Recall / Sudden Death. Old Man Rust is hit by a "memory-surge" from an ancient Zenith transmitter. For a single minute, he forgets his despair and remembers EVERYTHING from his childhood. The emotional weight of the loss causes his heart to stop.
- **Impact on Hatcher:** Hatcher is forced to realize that the "Rust" he lives in is actually a tomb of memories. His cynicism is replaced by a desperate, almost obsessive need to "fix" the Silt and restore the world of Rust’s memories.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "History" is buried. Without Rust to tell his stories, the Null Crew feels even more isolated in time, as they realize that they are the last ones who will ever know what the world was like before the Silt.

## III. Book 4 Integration (The Stone Season)

- **Location:** Chapter 16 ("The Scrapyard")
- **Scene:** "The Signal." A Resonance spike triggers "Absolute Recall," flooding him with memories of the pre-Fall world. The shock causes a heart attack.
- **Role:** The Victim of Truth. His death signifies that memory is dangerous in the Stone Season.
- **Quote:** _"The sky... it was blue! I remember the birds!"_
