# Character Profile: Joyce (The Needle)

**Archetype:** The Sleeper Agent / The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing / The Grandmother
**True Sin:** WRATH (A cold, dissociated capability for extreme violence. It is not the hot, emotional rage of Kaelen or Ironwood; it is the professional, surgical removal of obstacles. She kills without pulse elevation).
**Virtue Mask:** KINDNESS (She projects the ultimate non-threat: the frailty of age, the warmth of a hearth, the offering of food. She weaponizes the Zenith's dismissal of the elderly).

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Harmless Facade

Joyce is designed to be looked at and immediately dismissed. In a society obsessed with youth and perfection (Corinne, Grey), Joyce embraces the invisibility of decay.

### 1. The Frail Shell

- **Stature:** She is tiny, barely 5'0", shrinking with age as osteoporosis (accelerated by Resonance exposure) curves her spine. She moves with a shuffling, uncertain gait, leaning heavily on a walker or furniture. This clumsiness is entirely feigned; when active, she moves with the silence and speed of a spider.

- **The Face:** A landscape of wrinkles. Her skin is soft, powdery, and hangs loose on her jaw. She has kind, watery blue eyes magnified by thick spectacles. She often looks confused, blinking rapidly as if trying to recall where she is—a mixture of acting and the genuine side-effects of her Sacrifice.

- **The Hands:** To the casual observer, they are gnarled by arthritis, shaking slightly as she holds a teacup. To the trained eye (like Hatcher’s), the calluses are in the wrong places for a knitter—they are on the trigger finger and the palm-heel. Her grip strength is terrifying. When the tremor stops, her hands are steady enough to thread a needle or slit a carotid artery in the dark.

### 2. The Scent of Deception

Joyce creates an olfactory camouflage. She smells intensely of **Lavender**, **Peppermint**, and **Baking Powder**.

- **The Purpose:** This "Old Lady Smell" triggers a subconscious relaxation response in targets. More importantly, the strong essential oils mask the chemical scents of her trade: gun oil, cyanide (bitter almonds), and the ozone tang of her Resonance Bond.

### 3. The Blankness (Physiological Toll)

Because her Bond consumes **Memory**, Joyce often has a "reboot" look. Her face goes completely slack for a second as she loses a chunk of her past to pay for a kill. It looks like a petit mal seizure or a senior moment, but it is actually a lobotomy in real-time.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Joyce dresses in "Cardigan Camouflage." Her wardrobe is aggressively non-threatening, utilizing soft fabrics and pastels to disarm paranoia.

- **The Knitwear:** She is never without a cardigan, usually hand-knitted in soft pinks, blues, or creams. The wool is thick—thick enough to hide the Kevlar weave underneath. The loose sleeves hide spring-loaded holsters.

- **The Handbag:** A massive, bottomless floral carpet-bag.

  - _Contents:_ Hard candies (some poisonous), a Bible (hollowed out for comms gear), a thermos of tea (spiked), and spare ammunition wrapped in handkerchiefs to stop them from clinking.

- **The Spectacles:** Thick, bottle-bottom glasses on a beaded chain. They are actually a **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** linked to her Bond, highlighting thermal signatures and targeting solutions. When she peers over them "confusedly," she is actually calibrating a kill-shot.

- **The Knitting Needles:** Her signature weapons. They appear to be standard steel needles. In reality, they are **Null-Iron** stilettos, sharpened to a mono-molecular point. They can pierce Zenith body armor. She knits constantly to keep them in hand without raising suspicion.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Joyce operates on a dual frequency: The Grandmother and The Asset.

- **The Tea Ritual:** "Have a cup of tea, dear. You look cold." Offering food or drink is her primary infiltration tactic. It establishes a social contract (Guest Right) that makes the target lower their guard. It is also her delivery system for sedatives and toxins.

- **Feigned Deafness:** She constantly asks people to repeat themselves or speaks slightly too loudly. "What was that, dear?" This forces people to lean in close (entering her kill zone) and makes them underestimate her intelligence. She hears everything.

- **The "Click":** When she drops the mask, there is a physical transformation. The tremor stops. The stoop vanishes. Her voice drops an octave, losing the quaver. She goes from 80 years old to ageless predator in a nanosecond. Hatcher calls this "The Click."

- **The Humming:** She hums nursery rhymes while she works (cleaning weapons or mixing poisons). It is a mnemonic device to help her retain her remaining memories.

## IV. The Bond: Needle and The Memory Toll

Joyce’s magic is the ultimate trade-off: Skill for Self.

- **The Beast:** **Needle** (The Phase-Viper).

  - **Appearance:** Needle is a small, translucent serpent, no longer than a forearm. It looks like it is made of glass and smoke. It usually stays coiled inside Joyce’s sewing basket or wrapped invisibly around her wrist.
  - **Personality:** Cold, efficient, and silent. It does not speak; it only indicates targets.

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Covert Manifestation:** **Phasing**. Needle can turn objects (like Joyce’s knitting needles or bullets) intangible for a split second, allowing them to bypass armor or walls before re-solidifying inside the target.
  - **Overt Manifestation:** **The Strike**. Needle launches itself as a projectile, passing through flesh to stop a heart without breaking the skin.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Memory.**
  - _The Cost:_ To make matter intangible, Joyce must give up "matter" from her mind. Every use of the bond erases a specific memory. A small lockpick might cost her what she had for breakfast. A kill-shot might cost her the memory of her wedding day.
  - _The Horror:_ She is a tabula rasa. She knows she loves **Corinne**, but she cannot remember Corinne’s mother (her own daughter). She has killed the memory of her family to protect the only member left. She keeps a physical journal, but she often forgets how to read her own handwriting.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

**The Spy:** Joyce was once a high-ranking operative for the Zenith Intelligence Directorate. She was the handler for **Lady Vesper**. She specialized in "Quiet Removals."

**The Daughter:** Joyce had a daughter, Maura (Corinne’s mother). Maura was political, loud, and dangerous. She threatened the status quo. The Directorate ordered her removal. Joyce tried to save her, but failed (or perhaps, in a memory she burned to save Corinne, she was the one forced to do it).

**The Retirement:** Joyce took custody of the infant Corinne and "retired" to **Coopers Chase**, a facility for burned spies. She raised Corinne with a terrified, obsessive need to keep her useless. "Be the cushion, not the nail." She shaped Corinne into a vapid socialite to ensure Corinne would never be a target.

**The Inciting Incident (Book 2):** **Lady Vesper** activates Joyce. Vesper wants to destabilize the Emperor by killing the "Sangreal" (Angelica). Joyce’s deep-cover programming kicks in. She doesn't want to kill Angelica, but she has no choice. The programming is woven into the memories she has left.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 2: The Cipher of Sins — **_The Trap_**

- **State:** Joyce is living at Coopers Chase. She befriends Angelica, Hatcher, and Zephyr when they hide there. She knits socks for Zephyr.
- **The Turn:** The activation phrase is sent. Joyce prepares the **Bitter Almond Tea**.
- **The Interaction:** She hands Angelica the cup. "Drink, dear. It will settle your nerves." Her hand does not shake.
- **The Break:** Angelica smells the cyanide. She realizes the betrayal. Angelica uses the **Imperial Voice** (Command Voice). "JOYCE. SIT."
- **The Result:** The Command Voice clashes with Vesper’s programming. Joyce seizes. The programming shatters. Joyce wakes up, horrified. She realizes Vesper tried to make her kill a guest.
- **The Shift:** Joyce pledges loyalty to Angelica, recognizing her as the True Authority. She becomes the group's protector, turning her lethal skills against the Seekers.

### Book 3: The Game of Gears — **_The Shadow in the Court_**

- **State:** Joyce infiltrates the Palace disguised as a servant/grandmother visiting Corinne.
- **The Role:** She acts as the counter-intelligence officer. She spots Vesper’s spies and neutralizes them.
- **The Interaction with Corinne:** Corinne discovers Joyce cleaning blood off a stiletto. The illusion of the "Silly Grandmother" breaks.
  - _Corinne:_ "You killed him."
  - _Joyce:_ "He was going to poison your wine. Eat your vegetables, darling."
- **The Tragedy:** Joyce begins to lose critical memories. She forgets Zephyr’s name. She forgets where she is sleeping. The stress of the mission is eating her mind.

### Book 4: The Stone Season — **_The Final Guard_**

- **State:** In the apocalypse, Joyce is fragile. The cold hurts her bones. Without her medication, her mind slips into dementia.
- **The Decline:** She confuses Angelica with her dead daughter. She wanders off. Hatcher and Ria have to watch her.
- **The Climax:** The **Cannibal Gang** attacks the camp while the heavy hitters (Ria, Kaelen) are away foraging. They corner Corinne.
- **The Sacrifice:** Joyce experiences a moment of crystal clarity. She sees her granddaughter in danger. She summons **Needle** for a massive, room-clearing Phase Strike.
  - _The Cost:_ Total Wipe. To power the strike, she burns everything. Her name, her past, language, self.
  - \*The Act:\*\* She kills six attackers in two seconds, phasing her knitting needles through their armor.
  - \*The Death:\*\* She does not die from a wound. She dies because her brain empties. She collapses, breathing but vacant. She looks at Corinne and smiles, but there is no recognition behind the eyes. She dies holding Corinne’s hand, having forgotten who she is holding, only knowing that she is safe.

### Book 5 & Onward — **_The Legacy_**

- **The Needles:** Corinne takes Joyce’s needles. She wears them in her hair.
- **The Lesson:** Corinne stops playing the victim. She realizes her grandmother wasn't "silly"; she was playing a role to survive. Corinne adopts this strength. "I am the needle now."

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Corinne (The Gardner and the Flower)

- **The Dynamic:** _Protector and Protected._
- **Complexity:** Joyce loved Corinne so much she deliberately made her weak. She pruned Corinne’s ambition to keep her safe.
- **The Guilt:** Joyce carries the guilt of the daughter she couldn't save. She projects that onto Corinne.
- **The End:** In her final moments, Joyce forgets the guilt. She only feels the love. Corinne realizes that every vapid party she attended was bought with Joyce’s memories.

### 2. With Angelica (The Commander)

- **The Dynamic:** _The Soldier and the General._
- **The Shift:** After Angelica breaks the programming, Joyce views her with religious awe. Angelica is the "Captain" she was waiting for.
- **The Utility:** Angelica uses Joyce. She sends the old woman on scouting missions. Angelica feels guilty about this (using an old woman as a weapon), mirroring Vane’s utilitarianism.

### 3. With Hatcher (The Professionals)

- **The Dynamic:** _Game Recognizes Game._
- **The Interaction:** They sit on the porch at Coopers Chase. Hatcher cleans his gun; Joyce knits. They don't speak, but they understand each other. They are both killers trying to retire.
- **The Respect:** Hatcher is the only one who notices when Joyce is slipping (memory loss). He covers for her. He gently reminds her of things she forgot without shaming her.

### 4. With Lady Vesper (The Handler)

- **The Dynamic:** _Hatred._
- **The Conflict:** Vesper treats Joyce like a remote-control drone. Vesper assumes Joyce is too broken to rebel.
- **The Revenge:** In Book 3, Joyce slips a non-lethal paralytic into Vesper’s tea during a gala. As Vesper chokes, Joyce leans in and whispers, "I remember _some_ things, dear."

## VIII. Key Quotes & Internal Monologues

- _"Old age is the perfect disguise. No one looks at a withered hand and sees a weapon. They see a victim. And victims are dangerous because they have nothing to lose."_ (Book 2)
- _"I don't remember my husband’s face. I don't remember the color of my first house. But I remember how to break a trachea. Isn't that sad?"_ (To Hatcher, Book 2)
- _"Drink your tea, Angelica. The world is ending, but that is no excuse for bad manners."_ (Book 4)
- _"Who are you? You look like someone I loved."_ (Last words to Corinne).

### 4. The Sewing Circle

Joyce masks her lethality with the persona of a harmless grandmother. Her "friends" are fellow elderly citizens who seem benign but are often complicit in her cover, or simply provide a world of comfort that Angelica cannot access.

- **Mrs. Gable:** A sweet-faced old woman who knits alongside Joyce. They gossip about "the youngsters" and share tea. When Angelica enters, Mrs. Gable clutches her purse and looks at Joyce with wide, fearful eyes, prompting Joyce to "protect" her friend from the "scary silt-girl." It emphasizes Angelica as a monster disrupting peace.
- **Mr. Henderson:** A retired clockmaker who plays chess with Joyce in the park. They have a long-standing rivalry and flirtation. He brings Joyce flowers and ignores Angelica completely. The gentle, domestic normalcy of their relationship is a sharp contrast to the violence of Angelica’s life.
- **"Little" Timmy:** Not a child, but a massive, simple-minded orderly at the retirement home who adores Joyce. He carries her heavy bags and glares at anyone who looks at her wrong. He blocks Angelica’s path, crossing his arms and saying, "Miss Joyce is resting. Go away."
- **Nurse Ratched (The Handler):** A severe, professional nurse who administers Joyce’s "medication" (combat stims). She treats Joyce with professional respect and Angelica with bureaucratic disdain. She often scolds Angelica for "upsetting the residents" and chases her out of Joyce’s room.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 2 | Chapter 03 | Key Event | Joyce tracks the target. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 03 | Detailed Description | On a maintenance gantry overlooking the waste-processing plant, **Joyce (The Needle)** lowers her rifle scope. She watched the entire descent—the shattered window, the grappling hook catch, the crash landing. Her contract from Lady Vesper said to observe and report, not eliminate. Not yet. The Ward girl has skills. That complicates the price. She activates her encrypted comm and sends a single-word assessment: _"Survived."_ Then she melts into the industrial steam, her presence never detected. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 03 | Dialog | **Joyce (to her comm):** "Target survived the fall. Tracking to Mid-Levels. Contract status: observation phase continues." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 03 | Moment | **Joyce** — Her professional detachment is absolute; she watches a potential victim escape death with the same interest as a scientist observing an experiment. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 06 | Detailed Description | In a private booth of the Rusty Gear's upper balcony, obscured by synth-smoke, **Joyce (The Needle)** nurses a glass of something transparent and poisonous. She tracked the Ward girl here through infrared residue on the Mid-Levels corridors. Her encrypted comm vibrates—a message from **Lady Vesper** demanding an update. Joyce replies with coordinates and an assessment: _"Target has made contact with local assets. Hatcher—former detective. Lisbet—tech specialist. The girl is building a network. Price increases."_ Vesper's reply is curt: _"Approved. Continue observation. Do not engage."_ |
| Book 2 | Chapter 06 | Dialog | **Joyce (comm message):** "Target is recruiting. She has protectors now. Engagement will be messy. Awaiting authorization." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 06 | Moment | **Joyce** — Shows her mercenary professionalism, treating each new development as a renegotiation rather than a complication. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | On a rooftop overlooking the Rusty Gear, **Joyce (The Needle)** adjusts her parabolic microphone. She has been listening to fragments of the conversation inside—enough to know they're planning a heist at the Museum. Her comm buzzes. **Lady Vesper's** voice crackles through, cold and precise: _"Update."_ Joyce reports the target: Exhibit 404. The Cylinder. Vesper's pause is telling. She knows what the Cylinder is. "Let them take it," Vesper orders. "Then take it from them. Much cleaner than vault security." Joyce smiles. She always preferred working smarter, not harder. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Joyce (comm):** "They're going for the Museum. Vault 404. The girl knows something." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Hatcher:** "Joyce." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "You're bleeding on my porch, Detective. Come in before you ruin the petunias. And wipe your feet." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Joyce leads them to the back room. She moves a vase of daisies aside and presses a hidden button under the counter. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Joyce sees her looking. She picks up a medical kit. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Television always did add ten pounds of menace, dear. Real spycraft is about being the person nobody remembers." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "I just scrubbed the blood and grime out of this rug last Tuesday. And I'm not in the mood to do it again so soon. Hold still." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Where...? Who are you? Where is my son?" |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Hatcher:** (Softly) "Top shelf, left cabinet. Behind the chamomile. It's safe, Joyce. We're safe." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Joyce blinks. The light returns to her eyes. The terror fades. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Right where I left it. You always were observant, Detective. Now, this will sting." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | They sit in the parlor. Joyce serves them tea. It is hot and healing, dulling their pain instantly. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Angelica decides to trust her. She tells Joyce everything. About the Zenith. About the Ship. About Vane's lies. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Joyce listens, sipping her tea. She doesn't gasp. She doesn't look surprised. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "I always suspected. The gravity was too artificial. The stars... too static. They never twinkle right." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "You've opened the box, dear. Pandora's little casket." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Now you can never go back. Now you know. And knowing will destroy you—or save you. I honestly can't tell which yet. You have the Captain's eyes, but do you have her stomach?" |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "But until then... have a biscuit. It's ginger. And just a hint of cyanide for flavor. Good for the digestion." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Moment | **Joyce** — Reveals her dual nature as a deadly spy and a comforting caretaker, providing a sanctuary that acts as the emotional anchor for the team. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | While the team debriefs inside, **Ria (The Iron Vanguard)** takes up position outside, watching the street through the lace curtains. Her Titan armor is dented and scorched, but she keeps her hand on her weapon. Joyce's flower shop may be a clever disguise, but Ria trusts steel more than secrets. She notes the patrol patterns of the City Watch drones, counts the seconds between sweeps, and prepares contingencies. If the Zenith forces find them here, she will buy the others time to escape through whatever back exit Joyce surely has. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Ria (to the room):** "Two-minute gaps between drone sweeps. If we need to run, we go on my signal. Joyce, I assume you have a tunnel?" |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Behind the root cellar, dear. It leads to the sewers. I keep it stocked with oxygen masks. The smell is dreadful." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | The safehouse is located in the backrooms of "Joyce’s Floral Arrangements" in Sector 4. The contrast between the industrial grime of the Undercity and this parlor is jarring. There are doilies, flowered wallpaper, and the smell of lavender. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | She notices a "Spider-Lily" in a vase. It is a rare, poisonous plant used by the Assassins' Guild. She also notices that Joyce’s knitting needles are made of "Null-Iron," a metal used to pierce kinetic shields. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "This isn't a flower shop, Joyce. The perimeter sensors are military-grade. And you have a claymore mine under the welcome mat." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Joyce laughs, a warm, grandmotherly sound. She is bustling around the kitchen, boiling a kettle. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "A girl has to be safe in this neighborhood, dear. Would you prefer I let the riff-raff in?" |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | To Hatcher, it sounds like a doorbell. To Joyce, it is "Code Black." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Joyce pauses mid-movement. Her back is to the room. Her shoulders stiffen for a fraction of a second, then relax. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | **Internal POV (Joyce):** The "Grandmother" persona—the woman who loves baking and flowers—is shoved into a mental box. The "Needle" takes the wheel. There is no hesitation, no guilt. Only programming. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Moment | **Joyce** — She smiles at her reflection in the kettle. The smile doesn't reach her eyes. Her eyes are dead. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | **Internal POV (Joyce):** She looks at the knitting on the counter. A half-finished sock. _Who is this for?_ The thought floats across her mind like a dead leaf. She knows she was knitting it for someone she loved, someone with cold feet. But the name is gone. Burned as fuel for the transition from "Old Lady" to "Asset." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Joyce prepares the tea service. A silver tray, fine china cups. The porcelain is so thin it is almost translucent, much like her own cover identity. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Drink up, dears. It’s chamomile and honey. It will settle your nerves and help the healing. You look so pale, Mr. Detective." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Dialog | **Hatcher:** "Thanks, Joyce. My head’s pounding. Feels like I went ten rounds with a pile driver." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Joyce approaches Angelica. She offers the floral teacup with trembling, elderly hands. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "For you, sweetie. You look so tired. Let Auntie Joyce take care of it." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Joyce is still smiling, but her pulse in her neck is steady. Too steady. No micro-expressions of concern. No grandmotherly fussing. Just the flat, predatory gaze of a reptile waiting to strike. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Moment | **Angelica Ward** — She realizes this isn't a betrayal; it's a transaction. Joyce isn't evil; she's a weapon being fired by someone else. She sees the emptiness in Joyce's eyes—the sacrifice of memory for capability—and recognizes a twisted mirror of herself. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Angelica slaps the cup from Joyce's hand. It shatters on the floor. The liquid hisses where it touches the rug, burning a hole through the wool. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Key Event | Joyce doesn't flinch. The mask dissolves instantly. She stands straighter, her posture correcting from "elderly stoop" to "combat readiness." She pulls the Null-Iron knitting needles from her bun, her hair falling loose. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 17 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Pity. I hate cleaning up blood. The tea was much cleaner." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | The back room of Joyce's flower shop has become a killing floor. Joyce, her grandmotherly mask gone, stands with a poisoned needle in one hand and a silenced pistol in the other. The "Sleeper" programming has taken full control. She moves mechanically, her eyes empty of the warmth that usually defines her. Angelica backs away, hitting the wall. She can smell the bitter almonds of the cyanide. Her heart hammers against her ribs. In this moment of pure terror, something unlocks in her blood. The "Cylinder"—the artifact she retrieved from the museum—vibrates in her pocket, harmonizing with her pulse. A sensation of heat spreads from her chest, flooding her limbs. It is not adrenaline; it is _authority_. It is the genetic memory of her ancestors, the original Captains of the Zenith, waking up. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Dialog | **Joyce (monotone):** "Target acquired. Terminating. Compliance is mandatory." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | "JOYCE. SIT. RELEASE WEAPON. SUBMIT." The command is absolute. It bypasses Joyce's conscious mind and strikes her sleeper programming directly. Joyce freezes. Her muscles lock. The pistol falls from her hand with a clatter. She drops to her knees, her body obeying the biological override despite her mind's confusion. She tries to fight it, her face twitching, but the Resonance locks her joints. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Dialog | **Joyce (struggling):** "Command... authorization... Alpha... One... Error... Override..." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Key Event | Joyce is neutralized. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | Joyce remains kneeling, tears streaming down her face as her mind wars with her body. The "Captain's Voice" acts as a neural inhibitor. Angelica explains to the stunned group (Hatcher and Zephyr) that this is the "Admin Password." The Cylinder was the key, but she is the user. She walks around Joyce, inspecting her like a piece of faulty machinery. She touches Joyce's forehead, feeling the heat of the struggle. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | They tie Joyce to the chair with Null-Iron silk. Angelica sits opposite her. The power dynamic has flipped completely. Angelica demands answers. Who activated her? Who wants her dead? She uses the Resonance again, softer this time, to peel back Joyce's mental blocks. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | Joyce, broken and weeping, reveals the name: **Lady Vesper**. The Merchant Lord. Vesper wants Angelica dead because Angelica is the only thing standing between the Founders and total control of the Core. Vane wants to use her; Vesper wants to delete her. Joyce explains the politics of the Shadow Court, the ancient feuds that are tearing the ship apart. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | Across the city, in a private salon lit by candles, **Lady Corinne (The Porcelain Doll)** receives word from one of her informants embedded in Joyce's network. The flower shop assassination failed. More importantly, Ward used something—a voice, a power—that paralyzed a trained assassin. Corinne sets down her teacup with deliberate precision. The Ward girl has the Sangreal bloodline. She has the power to command. This changes the calculus entirely. Vesper is now a threat to be eliminated; Ward is an asset to be cultivated. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Key Event | Angelica interrogates the bound Joyce in the safehouse parlor. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | The safehouse is a hidden apartment in Sector 7, decorated with faded velvet drapes and antique furniture—a remnant of a bygone era. The atmosphere is surreal. Joyce sits in a high-backed chair, bound not with rope, but with "Null-Iron Silk," a material that dampens Resonance abilities. Despite the bondage, the table is set for high tea. There are cucumber sandwiches (made from synthetic paste) and a pot of Earl Grey. The juxtaposition of torture and etiquette is deliberate. Angelica stands over her, not shouting, but vibrating with the low-frequency hum of the "Captain's Voice." The sound rattles the teacups. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | Hatcher leans against the wall, eating a sandwich, watching Joyce with professional respect. Zephyr looks uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot. He liked Joyce. Seeing "Grandma" tied up feels wrong, even if she tried to kill them. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "The tea is lovely, Joyce. Now tell me who ordered the poison." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "You have your mother's eyes, dear. And your father's cruelty. It's a striking combination." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Key Event | Joyce breaks under the pressure of the Command Voice. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | Angelica leans in, whispering a command word that hits Joyce like a physical blow. Joyce gasps, her mental barriers shattering. She begins to speak, her voice flat and monotone as the truth spills out. She reveals the hierarchy of the "Shadow Court." The Founders—the heads of the Great Houses—are not descendants; they are the originals. They have used "Body-Hopping" technology to transfer their consciousness into new clones for three hundred years. They are immortal parasites feeding on the ship's resources. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "They are ghosts haunting a dying machine. They don't care about the ship, or the people, or the future. They only care about the next body. The next extension." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Key Event | Joyce reveals the contingency plan. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | If they cannot kill Angelica, they plan to capture her. Joyce explains the "Breeding Program." They intend to lobotomize Angelica and keep her in a stasis tank, using her as a broodmare to produce a new line of "Keys" that they can condition from birth. They want her genetics without her will. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | *Internal Conflict | Angelica looks at her hands. She sees the power there. She thinks of the Urchins in the sewer, of Joyce's betrayal, of her mother's death. She realizes that power is the only shield. If she wants to be safe, she must be the Queen. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | She unties Joyce. She tells Joyce that the "Sleeper" is dead. She offers Joyce a new job: not as a sleeper agent for the ghosts, but as a knight for the new Queen. Joyce rubs her wrists, looking at Angelica with a mix of fear and awe. She nods. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | While the interrogation unfolds inside, **Ria (The Iron Vanguard)** stands guard at the safehouse's rear entrance, her armor powered down to conserve energy but her weapon ready. She can hear fragments of Joyce's confession through the thin walls—the body-hopping, the breeding program, the horror of what they planned for Angelica. Her hands tighten on her rifle. She has fought in riots and put down murderers, but this systematic evil is something different. When Angelica emerges with the declaration of war, Ria is ready. She doesn't need convincing. She needs a target. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | The front parlor of "Petal & Stem" is dim, filled with the scent of lilies and old dust. Joyce has shoved a heavy oak dresser in front of the door, but the wood splinters like balsa as the door explodes inward. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | He walks slowly toward the back wall. **Angelica Ward** stands there, clutching a small paring knife joyce gave her. She is shaking, but she holds her ground. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 23 | Detailed Description | What the team doesn't know is that they had backup. On the rooftop opposite The Gilded Cage, **Joyce (The Needle)** lies prone behind a thermal shroud, her long rifle trained on the club's entrance. She was hired by an anonymous benefactor to ensure the Ward girl survived this operation. When the guards failed to pursue into the sewers, she packed up her gear silently. The contract specified non-interference unless necessary—and the team proved capable. She files them all away in her mental ledger: the girl with the voice, the thief with the hand, the hacker with the goggles. Useful contacts, should she ever need them. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 23 | Dialog | **Joyce (whispering):** "Targets extracted clean. Contract complete. The Ward girl is becoming expensive to protect." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 25 | Detailed Description | On the rooftop of an adjacent residential tower, **Joyce (The Needle)** tracks the Warden pursuit team through her scope. She's been shadowing the group since they entered the broadcast tower—her contract requires she ensure delivery of the package, and the package travels with Ward. When the Wardens reach Floor 82, she puts two of them down with silent, precise shots through the stairwell windows. The others take cover, their advance stalled. She buys the team the three minutes they need. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 25 | Dialog | **Joyce (whispering):** "Two down. Six remaining. Buying you time, Ward. Earn it." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | Detailed Description | Angelica feels like a bull in a china shop. Sitting next to Corinne is **Joyce**, a frail, confused-looking elderly woman knitting a scarf that seems to have no end. Joyce is introduced as Corinne's "Great-Aunt" from the country, a harmless relic who constantly asks for more sugar. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | *Internal Conflict | Angelica is suffocating. The corset Corinne forced her into restricts her breathing. She despises the frivolity. She watches Joyce, knowing the "old woman" is actually a lethal sleeper agent. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | Dialog | **Lady Corinne:** (Hissing behind her fan) "Stop tapping. You sound like a leaky pipe. Drink your tea. And for heaven's sake, smile at Aunt Joyce. She's the only one here who isn't trying to poison you." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | Dialog | **Joyce (The Needle):** (Loudly, appearing senile) "Did you say poison, dear? I thought we were having Earl Grey. You know I can't digest poison after noon." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 06 | Detailed Description | Standing at the perimeter of the auction floor, **Joyce (The Needle)** maintains her post as part of the Zenith's security detail. Her eyes sweep the crowd with professional efficiency, cataloging threats. She notes Angelica's unusual bidding behavior and Baron Gilded's intense observation, filing both details away for later analysis. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 09 | Detailed Description | The effects are reported on the news feeds almost instantly. In the gilded bathrooms of the Spire, crystal faucets sputter and spit out brown, foul-smelling sludge. Aristocrats scream. **Lord Cromwell** is seen calmly filtering his tea through a silk handkerchief, unimpressed by the disruption. **General Ironwood** deploys the guard to secure the water reserves, treating the incident as a bio-hazard attack. **Joyce (The Needle)**, acting as Corinne's eyes, observes the panic with cold detachment, noting which families break composure first. Dinner parties are ruined. The illusion of perfection is shattered. The maintenance crews are overwhelmed with complaints. Vane's security forces are scrambled to find the source, but the jammers hide the team's exit. The "untouchable" Zenith has been touched by the filth they try to ignore. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 10 | Detailed Description | Corinne is laughing with a group of suitors near the balcony. A young, handsome nobleman bumps into her, his hand slipping a micro-transmitter into the folds of her dress. Before he can withdraw, **Joyce** (the "Great-Aunt") stumbles, spilling her purse. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 10 | Key Event | Joyce neutralizes the spy with a "clumsy" accident. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 10 | Detailed Description | As Joyce falls, her hand lashes out with the speed of a viper. She drives a knitting needle through the spy's expensive shoe, pinning his foot to the floor. he screams. It looks like a senile accident. In the confusion, she retrieves the transmitter and drops it into a champagne flute. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 10 | Moment | **Joyce (The Needle)** — She apologizes profusely to the screaming man, offering him a candy from her bag while expertly checking his pulse to ensure he doesn't go into shock and cause a scene. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 10 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Oh, you poor dear! I am so clumsy. These old floors are so slippery. Have a peppermint. It helps with the pain." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 10 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Whispering, the mask dropping for a micro-second) "Walk away, or the next one goes in your eye." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 14 | Detailed Description | The mess hall is a converted storage bay, the walls lined with pipes that drip condensation. The lighting is dim, provided by string lights scavenged from holiday decorations. The air smells of recycled air and the faint, savory scent of protein mash. Angelica, Silas, Miller, and Corinne sit at a metal table. They are eating from tin bowls. **Joyce**, Corinne's grandmother, sits in a rocking chair fashioned from pipes, knitting furiously. She hums a nursery rhyme that Miller slowly realizes is actually a Morse code frequency for the guard rotation. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 14 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Without looking up from her knitting) "Rat has more protein than peacock, dear. Eat up. You'll need the energy for the running." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | Joyce visits the cell. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | **Joyce** shuffles past the open door, leaning heavily on a walker. She looks lost and confused, muttering about her "missing spectacles." Sir Alistair steps aside, amused by the senile old woman. Joyce stumbles into the room and hugs Corinne, weeping dramatically about "my poor baby in a cage." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Moment | **Joyce** — As she hugs Corinne, her grip is steel. She presses a tiny, needle-thin lockpick into Corinne's palm. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Whispering) "The Knight takes the Queen, dear. Remember your lessons. Be the needle, not the thread." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Loudly, pulling away) "And you look dreadful! Fix your hair, child!" |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | In the shadow of a pillar, a servant refills empty glasses. It is **Joyce (The Needle)**, wearing a stiff uniform and a wig. She moves invisibly, her eyes recording every conversation, every alliance, every weakness. The "Grandmother" is gone; only the asset remains. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | **Joyce**, seated nearby and seemingly asleep, suddenly knocks over a heavy silver candelabra with a "startled" twitch. The massive crash draws every eye in the room. In that split second of distraction, Corinne stands up, pretending to stumble in her heels to mask the movement further. She deftly swaps Angelica's glass with the one intended for Lady Vesper, who is seated opposite. The movement is so fast, so fluid, it looks like a clumsy accident. She apologizes profusely, dabbing at a spill with her napkin. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 27 | Key Event | Joyce's contribution. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 27 | Detailed Description | **Joyce** sits in the corner, ostensibly knitting scarves for the "poor boys." But inside each rolled-up bundle of wool is a datapad containing override codes for the sector's security doors. She hands them out with a warm smile. "Wear it in good health, dear. Try not to catch a cold... or a bullet." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 27 | Moment | **Joyce** — She weaponizes her harmless grandmother persona to distribute high-grade intel right under the noses of potential spies. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 28 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (From the shadows, polishing a monocle) "Don't worry about the favors, Mr. Zephyr. I've already called in the debts. The smugglers owe _me_, and by extension, they owe you. Just make sure the explosives are fresh." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 29 | Key Event | Joyce disrupts the sensor grid. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 29 | Detailed Description | While Silas makes noise, **Joyce** is two blocks away, "hiding" in a maintenance alcove. She connects a specialized needle-probe into the fiber-optic trunk line. With a few precise taps, she feeds a loop into the Spire's external sensors, blinding the automated defenses to the climbers above. She pats the console like a good child. "Sleep now, darling. The grownups are talking." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 33 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Herding the group with her cane) "Single file, children! No pushing! Corinne, mind your hem. Silas, stop shooting and jump!" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 04 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Peering through her lorgnette) "It has a fascinating lattice structure, doesn't it? Like a diamond with a pulse. Be a dear and don't drop it, Doctor. I'd hate to have to shoot you." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 05 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Shuffling in behind them, clutching her knitting bag) "It was dreadful, truly. Poor Vance. He always was a bit tough, I imagine. Not much marbling." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Already organizing cans by expiration date) "Tuna... 2099. Peaches... 2101. Excellent vintage. Zephyr, dear, do be careful with those power cells. Use the padded bag." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 12 | Key Event | Joyce's selection. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 12 | Detailed Description | While the others argue over philosophy versus science, **Joyce** quietly pulls three specific books from the "Genealogy" section. They look like boring lists of names. She slips them into her coat. They are actually the cipher keys for the old Aristocracy's communication channels. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 12 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (To herself) "Let them burn the poetry. I'll keep the phone book." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Throughout the meeting, **Joyce (The Needle)** stands watch at the war room's entrance. Her eyes never stop scanning—cataloging every face, every hand position, every potential threat. Even in the Lifeboat, she trusts no one fully. When Angelica issues the order to move out, Joyce gives a barely perceptible nod of approval. The plan is sound, the risk manageable. She will follow the Ward girl into the dark. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Joyce (to herself):** "Into the abyss. Again. At least the young ones still believe in causes." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | The foyer is decorated with floral wallpaper and plush carpets. Classical music plays softly from hidden speakers. A severe-looking nurse in a crisp white uniform stands behind a mahogany reception desk. Beside her stands an elderly woman, small and frail-looking, wearing a hand-knit cardigan and holding a pair of knitting needles. This is Joyce. She looks over her spectacles at the heavily armed, filthy survivors with an expression of mild disapproval, as if they are grandchildren who have been playing in the mud. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Moment | **Joyce (The Needle)** — She maintains a perfect facade of grandmotherly concern, her body language non-threatening, hiding the lethal reflexes of the Undercity's most feared assassin. She treats the apocalypse as a minor inconvenience, a rude interruption to tea time. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "It's just poor travelers. Don't be a dragon, Nurse Ratched. Put the kettle on. They look like they haven't eaten a hot meal in a week." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | Joyce asks polite questions about the "weather" outside and the "trouble" in the city. Her tone is casual, but the questions are probing. She is assessing their threat level, their allegiances, and their knowledge. Kaelen, usually stoic, finds himself relaxing under her grandmotherly attention, until he notices a small, faded tattoo on her wrist—a spiderweb design used by the old Assassin's Guild. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "So, dearie, are you running _from_ the fire, or _to_ it? It makes a difference to the tea service." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | Henderson stands up to get more sugar, his "frail" movements exaggerated. He bumps into a side table, knocking over Joyce’s large knitting bag. It hits the floor with a heavy, metallic _clank_ that no yarn should make. The contents spill out across the Persian rug. Instead of wool, out rolls a jagged combat knife, a handful of high-yield flash-bang grenades, and a compact sub-machine gun with the serial numbers filed off. The silence in the room is absolute. The "seniors" stop their activities instantly. Mrs. Gable's eyes snap open, clear and cold. Henderson straightens up, his tremors vanishing, his posture shifting into a combat crouch. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce sighs, a sound of genuine disappointment. She had hoped to maintain the charade a little longer. She looks at the weapons on the floor, then at the stunned survivors. The mask of the kindly grandmother dissolves, revealing the predator underneath. Her eyes harden, losing their warmth. She picks up a knitting needle, testing the point against her thumb. It draws a drop of blood. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Moment | **Joyce (The Needle)** — The transition is seamless. One moment she is a host; the next she is a warlord holding court. She does not apologize or explain. She simply accepts the new reality. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Dialog | **Joyce (The Needle):** "The world is dangerous, child. I just brought the tools to match it. Now, sit down. The biscuits are still warm, and I haven't decided if I'm going to kill you yet." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | The room transforms. The "elderly" residents reveal hidden weapons—pistols from cushions, blades from canes. The survivors are outgunned in seconds. Joyce stands in the center, the absolute authority. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "We retired for a reason. We wanted peace. But if you bring the war to my doorstep, I will remind you why they called me The Needle." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce watches from the foyer. She knows what is coming. She knows that kindness is a death sentence in this world. She tries to pull Mrs. Gable away, but it is too late. A single shot rings out—a "False Flag" sniper round from Torque’s men. It shatters the glass and hits Mrs. Gable in the chest. She falls, her knitting bag spilling onto the floor. The sight of blood sends the mob into a frenzy. They surge forward, breaking down the doors. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Gable, get away from the glass! They don't want your pity, they want your food! Get back!" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Mrs. Gable:** "But look at them, Joyce. They're so hungry..." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "...She's gone. Timmy! Secure the hallway!" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Key Event | The mob breaches the facility. "Little" Timmy defends Joyce. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | The hallway becomes a kill zone. Scavengers pour in, smashing furniture and looting. Timmy, the massive orderly, stands in front of Joyce like a shield. He uses a heavy oak table as a weapon, sweeping attackers aside. But he is overwhelmed. A scavenger with a laser cutter slices through his leg. Timmy falls but refuses to move, covering Joyce with his body. He takes blow after blow, his eyes locked on Joyce, waiting for her command. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | Joyce snaps. The "Grandmother" persona evaporates completely. She pulls the knitting needles from her hair. **Needle**, her Phase-Viper bond, manifests around her arm. She moves into the mob. It is not a fight; it is a slaughter. She moves faster than the eye can follow, her needles phasing through armor and bone. She strikes with surgical precision—carotid, femoral, ocular. In seconds, ten men are dead. She stands over Timmy, breathing hard, her cardigan splattered with blood. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce looks at Timmy. He is dying. His sacrifice has bought her time, but it has broken her heart. She touches his face, her bloody hand trembling—not from age, but from grief. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Moment | **Joyce (The Needle)** — She embraces her true nature to save the only family she has left. She becomes the monster the Zenith made her. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Timmy (wheezing):** "Did I stop them, Miss Joyce? Did I do good?" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Yes, Timmy. You were the best boy. You were the cushion." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | Joyce retreats to the office to get the emergency medical kit. She finds Nurse Ratched there, calmly packing a bag with high-value drugs. Ratched holds a syringe gun. She reveals that she is not just an employee; she is a Zenith handler. She was sent to keep Joyce pacified, to keep the "Weapon" in storage. But now that Joyce is active, she is a liability. Ratched moves to euthanize her. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce feels the final betrayal. Her sanctuary was a prison. Her friends were inmates. Her life was a lie managed by the state. The rage that fills her is cold and absolute. She does not attack Ratched; she simply stares at her, letting the realization sink in. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Moment | **Nurse Ratched** — She displays the banality of evil. She doesn't hate Joyce; she just follows protocol. She views the residents as expired assets to be liquidated. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Nurse Ratched:** "The Zenith made me an offer. All I had to do was keep you pacified. Warm milk and sedatives. But active assets are dangerous. It's time for your nap, Joyce." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "I'm not sleepy, dear. I'm wide awake." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Key Event | Angelica and the team arrive to extract Joyce. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | Angelica kicks the door in. She sees the standoff. Ratched turns, firing the syringe gun. Angelica deflects it with her armored gauntlet. She knocks Ratched unconscious (or kills her, depending on the heat of the moment). The facility is burning around them. The mob is looting the upper floors. Angelica grabs Joyce, who is standing over Ratched's body, catatonic. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | They flee into the maintenance tunnels beneath the facility. The heat of the fire chases them. Joyce stumbles, dropping her knitting bag. She tries to go back for it, for the memory of the life she just lost. Angelica holds her back, forcing her to move. **Baron Gilded** is with them, having been sheltering in the facility when the attack began. He trips over debris, his borrowed shoes too large for his feet. He mutters about fire insurance and liability as he runs, his mind retreating into familiar patterns to avoid processing the horror. **Lady Corinne** runs beside him, having kicked off her heels kilometers ago. She is barefoot in the muck, but her head is high. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce is broken. She has lost her home, her friend Gable, her protector Timmy, and her illusion of peace. She is just a killer in the dark again. She looks at her hands, still stained with blood, and weeps silently. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Moment | **Joyce** — She accepts her exile. She leaves the grandmother behind in the ashes. She takes the needles, wipes them clean, and puts them back in her hair. The Needle is back. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "I just wanted to knit. I just wanted to be normal. Why won't they let me be normal?" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "Because the world is broken, Joyce. And it needs people who know how to break it back. The illusion was ash. You're awake now. Walk." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | As the group flees through the tunnels, the facility's emergency broadcast system crackles to life. The screens embedded in the maintenance corridor flicker—and **The Emperor's** distorted face appears. His digital ghost has followed them even here, into the wreckage of Joyce's sanctuary. His hollow laughter echoes off the metal walls. He does not threaten; he mocks. He calls Joyce a "broken weapon" and Angelica a "pretender queen." His presence is a reminder that they are never truly hidden, never truly safe. The ship itself is watching them. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Can't he? Words started this war. Words killed Gable." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | A medical alert chimes on Angelica's comms. It's Hatcher. "Get to Med-Bay. It's Joyce." They run. When they arrive, Joyce—the sweet, confused old woman who "knitted" with sharpened stilettos—is lying on a bio-bed. She isn't injured. She is simply... fading. Her mind, fractured by years of torture and the stress of the escape, has finally given out. The connection is severed. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | Lady Corinne is kneeling beside the bed, holding Joyce's withered hand. Joyce's eyes are open, but they are wandering. There is no recognition. The "The Needle" is gone; only a scared old woman remains. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Dialog | **Joyce (weakly):** "The tea is... ready. Would you... like some? I think... I put too much sugar." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Dialog | **Corinne (weeping):** "No, Joyce. The tea is perfect. It's the best tea I've ever had." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | Hatcher stands in the doorway. He touches the scar on his temple. He feels the sudden, massive "hollow" of Joyce's final memory burning away. A resonance node is going dark. He realizes she is lost in the drift. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Dialog | **Hatcher (softly):** "The tea is hot, Joyce. And the door is locked. We're safe, aren't we?" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Safe. Yes. That's the word. Safe." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | Before the light fades entirely, Joyce fumbles with her sash. She pulls out her knitting needles—long, deadly titanium spikes. She presses them into Corinne's hands. Her grip is surprisingly strong for a moment, then goes slack. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Dialog | **Joyce (last words):** "You were never silly, Corinne. You were just... waiting. Make them bleed, dear." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | They cover Joyce with a sheet. The room is silent. The death wasn't violent, which makes it worse. It was a chaotic universe claiming a tired soul. Angelica looks at the body. Then she looks at her crew—Hatcher, Corinne, Zephyr, Ria. They are all broken. They are all tired. **General Ironwood** stands at attention by the door, offering a crisp salute to the fallen assassin—recognizing a soldier, regardless of her methods. **Baron Gilded** hovers at the back, uncomfortable with death but unable to look away. For the first time, he sees a price that cannot be bought back. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 27 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Patting Angelica's arm with a gloved hand) "If it helps, dear, most 'natural' births are accidental messes. Being 'manufactured' at least implies intent. Someone _wanted_ you to exist. That's more than most of us can say." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 28 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Staring at the pulsing cables) "It's a weave. Look at the patterns. Arteries knit into fiber-optics. It's not distinct; it's a tapestry. A horrible, bloody tapestry. I've never seen stitch-work like this." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 32 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Quietly, cleaning her monocle) "I have to agree with the loud gentleman. Some secrets don't decay, Doctor. They fester. Best to lance the boil." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 32 | Detailed Description | As Squad Iron stares at the stars, others emerge from the airlock behind them. **Lady Corinne** shivers, pulling her tattered shawl closer. She refuses to look at the stars; the infinity terrifies her. **Joyce** stands silently behind her, blocking the draft from the vent, a human shield against the cold. **Lisbet (The Glitch)** climbs up, Figment's fading hologram on her shoulder. She finds a spot near Zephyr, her goggles reflecting the nebula's glow. **Hatcher (The Null)** steps onto the observation deck, shotgun slung over his shoulder. He says nothing, just lights a cigarette and watches the void. Even **Baron Gilded**—reduced now to a shivering wreck in borrowed clothes, his wealth meaningless—has followed them. He stares at the stars with hollow, traumatized eyes. Out there, in the infinite dark, his gold means nothing. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 33 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Holding Lisbet's trembling shoulders) "Don't look away, child. She's buying you the sky. You owe her the courage to watch." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 01 | Detailed Description | **Joyce** moves through the cryo-bay with efficient, quiet steps. She checks the nutrient feeds, her face a mask of grandmotherly concern that hides her lethal programming. She ensures Angelica's pod is functioning perfectly, adjusting a valve with a precise, mechanical twist. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 01 | Moment | **Joyce** — She maintains the facade of the kindly caretaker even when no one is watching, a testament to her deep-cover discipline. |
