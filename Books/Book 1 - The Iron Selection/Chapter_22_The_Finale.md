## Chapter 22: The Finale

### Scene 1: The Spire

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron climbs 10,000 steps up the white crystal Spire—three thousand feet tall, spiral staircase on exterior.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We made it. We actually made it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I'm never climbing stairs again."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "The extraction point. We are the first."

### Scene 2: The Announcement

- **Key Event:** A fifty-foot hologram of Headmaster Vane appears, congratulating them for conquering the Arena. Cameras broadcast to millions of Highborns.

- **Key Event:** Vane reveals "budgetary constraints" have reduced extraction to a shuttle with capacity for TWO personnel—but there are three of them.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "The extraction shuttle has capacity for two personnel. But there are three of you. How unfortunate."

### Scene 3: The Implication

- **Key Event:** Angelica calculates: 3 - 2 = 1. One person stays behind and dies when the Arena is incinerated ("Sanitized") in one hour.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We won! We're a squad!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "There are no squads in the Zenith. Only individuals who are strong enough to survive."

- **Key Event:** A five-minute timer appears. Vane says if they don't choose, the shuttle leaves empty.
