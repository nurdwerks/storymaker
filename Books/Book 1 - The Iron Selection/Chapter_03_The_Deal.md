## Chapter 3: The Deal

### Scene 1: The Ultimatum

- **Key Event:** Wardens (massive, faceless enforcers in ceramic-plate armor) emerge and restrain Angelica with hydraulic grips while a third drags unconscious Leo from the crawlspace.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't touch him! He's sick! You'll kill him!"

- **Key Event:** Angelica kicks a Warden's servo-actuator and lunges toward Leo, but Vane deploys his Legion nano-swarm to bind her with magnetic bands.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Energy expended on resistance is energy subtracted from survival. Do the math, Miss Ward. You are good at math."

### Scene 2: The Explanation

- **Key Event:** Vane explains that the Zenith runs on Resonance—background radiation from the planet's engine core. Some people absorb it and become Mages; most absorb it and rot.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Reveals his scientific approach, viewing cruelty as inefficient and himself as "rigorous."

- **Key Event:** Vane reveals Leo's lungs are crystallizing because his genetics are incompatible with the atmosphere—he is "allergic to the world."

- **Key Event:** Vane explains that Angelica is a "Null" with zero Resonance exposure—a blank slate he believes can be "written upon" like a formatted hard drive.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I don't want a natural-born mage who thinks power is their birthright. I want a mage I can code."

### Scene 3: The Choice

- **Key Event:** Angelica calculates the odds: 88% mortality rate for Squad Iron versus 0% survival for Leo without intervention. 12% is infinitely higher than 0%.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Replaces tears with cold calculation, driven by brutal mathematics.

- **Key Event:** Angelica accepts the deal with conditions: Leo gets a window (he likes the sky), and she receives daily proof-of-life via video or vital scan.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He gets a window. He likes the sky. And I want proof of life sent to my datapad every morning."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Agreed. See? We are negotiating already. You have the soul of a politician, Miss Ward."

### Scene 4: The Goodbye

- **Key Event:** Wardens carry Leo to the medical shuttle while Angelica is dragged toward the gold elevator leading to the Academy. She is denied a goodbye.

- **Key Event:** Angelica rips one hand free and blindly types a message to Leo on her cracked datapad: "I'm going to work. Big job. Don't worry about me. Be good. Eat your greens. I will buy the sky for you."

- **Key Event:** In the gold elevator, Angelica Ward—Scavenger Prince of Sector 12—transforms. She hardens her jaw, pushes fear into a dark place, and Cadet Ward is born.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Undergoes internal transformation from terrified scavenger to determined cadet.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ambition is just survival with a better haircut. If they want a monster, I'll build them one."
