## Chapter 35: The Interface

### Scene 1: The Core Room

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward enters the ship's Interface Core, located at the very heart of the Command Spire. This is the room where Prelate Vane used to commune with the ship's systems, and where he ultimately died.
- **Detailed Description:** The Interface Core is a spherical chamber, fifty feet across, lined with active cooling pipes that pulse with blue-white light. The air is freezing, kept at sub-zero temperatures to protect the delicate superconducting filaments that line the walls. In the center of the room, suspended over a pit of coolant fluid, is the Interface Throne. It does not look like a chair; it looks like a torture device. It is a cage of chrome and ceramic, fitted with hundreds of neural needles, restraints, and data-jacks. The floor is a mesh grate, allowing the mist from the coolant pit to rise and swirl around the Throne. The room smells of ozone and old blood—a lingering reminder of Vane's surgeries. The silence is absolute, save for the hum of the ship's mind waiting for a pilot. The lighting is dim, focused entirely on the empty seat, making it look like an altar to a cruel god.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica shivers, her breath misting in the cold air. She is terrified. She knows what this machine does. It doesn't just read your mind; it rewrites it. Vane survived it because he had replaced half his brain with processors. Angelica is still mostly biological. She fears that if she sits in that chair, she will lose herself. She will become just another component of the ship. But she pushes the fear down. The fleet is outside. Her friends are dying. There is no other choice. She is the only one with the "Sangreal" bloodline compatible with the system.

### Scene 2: The Preparation

- **Key Event:** Kaelen and Ria follow Angelica into the room. They stop at the edge of the mesh walkway. They know what she is about to do.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen looks pale, his eyes wide with panic. He takes a step toward her, his hand reaching out. "Angelica, don't. There has to be another way. We can overload the reactor. We can ram them. Anything but this." Ria stands beside him, her helmet under her arm. She looks at the Throne with undisguised horror. To a cyborg like her, the Throne represents the ultimate violation—forced integration. She grips her weapon, looking around the room as if she expects the machine to attack them.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica stops. She turns to face them. She sees their fear, and it breaks her heart. She wants to run to Kaelen, to let him hold her, to hide in his shadow one last time. But she can't. If she wavers now, she won't be able to do it. She has to be the Captain. She has to be the one who pays the price.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the "Copper Token"—the cheap, stamped luck charm Vane gave her in Book 1. It is warm from her hand. It represents the beginning of her journey, the lie that started it all. She walks over to Kaelen and presses it into his palm. She closes his fingers over it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Hold this for me. If I'm not back in an hour... melt it down. Don't keep it as a souvenir."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Angelica, please. You won't come back. That thing eats souls. I can't watch you die again."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Then I'll give it indigestion. Go. Seal the door behind you. Whatever happens, don't interrupt the signal. If you pull me out halfway, I'll be lobotomized."

### Scene 3: The Sit Down

- **Key Event:** Angelica climbs into the Interface Throne. The machine detects her presence and wakes up.
- **Detailed Description:** The restraints snap shut around her wrists and ankles with a metallic clang. The neural halo descends from the ceiling, hovering inches above her skull. The needles—hundreds of micro-filaments designed to pierce the scalp and connect directly to the cerebral cortex—begin to spin. The sound is a high-pitched whine, like a dentist's drill amplified. Angelica takes a deep breath. She stares up at the ceiling of the sphere. She can feel the cold metal of the headrest against her neck. She can smell the sterile lubricant of the needles. Her heart is hammering against her ribs.
- **Internal Conflict:** She thinks of Leo. She thinks of the Undercity. She thinks of the first time she fixed a drone. She holds onto her identity with both hands. *I am Angelica Ward. I am a mechanic. I fix broken things.* She recites the Fibonacci sequence in her head to ground herself. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...

- **Key Event:** The needles strike.
- **Detailed Description:** There is a sound like a staple gun firing rapidly. Angelica arches her back, a silent scream trapped in her throat. The pain is blinding, white-hot and absolute. It feels like lightning striking her brain. It isn't just physical pain; it is the sensation of her skull being pried open. Her vision explodes into white static. She can feel the needles threading through her brain tissue, seeking the connection points. Her body convulses, straining against the restraints. Blood trickles from her nose and ears.
- **Internal Conflict:** Then, the pain vanishes, replaced by a flood of data. The room disappears. Kaelen and Ria disappear. Her body disappears. She is falling upward into a sea of code. She sees the ship not as walls and floors, but as a skeleton of light. She feels the engines as her heart. She feels the hull breach as a cut on her skin. She hears the thoughts of the crew as a distant murmur. She is the ship. She is the *Aeterna*.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — In the digital void, she opens her eyes (metaphorically). She does not dissolve. She grabs the data stream and forces it to submit. She imposes her will on the machine. She builds a mental avatar—a version of herself made of golden fire. She stands in the center of the ship's mind and demands attention.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Connection established. System check: Green. Initiate protocol: Diplomatic Immunity. Let's talk to the manager."
