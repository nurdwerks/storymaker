## Chapter 06: The Discovery

### Scene 1: The Treasury

- **Key Event:** Zephyr, tasked with inventorying the Lower Decks of the *Aeterna*, breaks the seal on a reinforced vault door labeled "Payload 4."
- **Detailed Description:** The vault door is a slab of titanium alloy, sealed with a biometric lock that died centuries ago. Zephyr uses a laser-cutter to slice through the hinges. Sparks fly, illuminating the dark corridor. He kicks the door in. The beam of his flashlight cuts through the stale air, revealing a room stacked floor-to-ceiling with crates. He pries one open. The light reflects off gold. Bars of it. Bullion stamped with the logos of dead nations. He opens another crate. Diamonds. Another. Rare earth metals.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr realizes he has found the ship's financial payload, intended to jumpstart the economy of the new world.
- **Detailed Description:** He does the math in his head. At current exchange rates (back in the Zenith), he is looking at trillions of credits. He is standing in the middle of more wealth than the entire Undercity generated in a generation. He picks up a gold bar. It is heavy, cold, and smooth.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr feels the familiar rush of greed. This is the "Big Score" he dreamed of his entire life. He could buy a moon. He could buy an army. But then the reality of their situation hits him. They are drifting in deep space, hunted by aliens, with no port to dock at. There are no shops. There are no banks. The gold is just heavy yellow metal.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He laughs. It starts as a chuckle and builds into a roar of ironic mirth. He sits on a stack of gold bars, wiping tears from his eyes. He realizes the absurdity of his ambition. He spent his life chasing this, and now that he has it, it is utterly useless.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I did it. I won the game. I'm the richest man in the graveyard. And I'd trade it all for a sandwich. A real sandwich. With mustard."

### Scene 2: The Souvenir

- **Key Event:** Zephyr decides what to do with the treasure.
- **Detailed Description:** He stands up. He looks at the crates. He thinks about telling the others, but realizes it would only cause morale problems. People would fight over it, even if it's useless. It's a distraction.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr takes a single gold bar.
- **Detailed Description:** He weighs it in his hand. He slides it into his pocket. Not as currency, but as a reminder of who he used to be. A memento of the "Gilded Rogue." He seals the crate back up.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr reports to Lisbet over the comms.
- **Detailed Description:** He activates his headset. Lisbet is in Engineering, trying to fix the water recyclers. Her voice is tired, stressed.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Zephyr? Did you find anything useful down there? We need copper wire. Or insulation. Please tell me you found insulation."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Just... ballast, Lis. Heavy metal. Nothing we can eat. Nothing we can burn."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Ugh. Useless. Bring me back something useful. Like a screwdriver. I lost mine in the vent."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Yeah. A screwdriver. I'll look. I think that's worth more than gold right now."

### Scene 3: The Ghost of Value

- **Key Event:** Zephyr leaves the vault, welding the door shut behind him.
- **Detailed Description:** He uses the laser cutter to fuse the metal. He marks the door with a hazard symbol: "RADIATION DANGER. DO NOT ENTER." He lies to protect the crew from their own greed. He walks away, the gold bar heavy in his pocket, a symbol of a world that no longer exists. He heads toward the maintenance bays to find a screwdriver for Lisbet.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He chooses utility over wealth. He prioritizes the needs of the engineer over the desires of the thief. He has begun his transformation from a selfish rogue to a pragmatic survivor.

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Scenes:** Break each chapter into component scenes based on location changes, time jumps, or POV shifts.
2. **Key Events:** Bullet point all significant actions, revelations, or plot progressions.
3. **Detailed Description:** This is the primary place to expand the word count. Describe the environment, the sensory details (smell, sound, temperature), and the specific physical actions of the characters.
4. **Internal Conflict:** Add this section where characters are facing difficult choices or emotional turmoil.
5. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
6. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
7. **Flexibility:** Not every key event requires both a defining moment and dialog—include what applies. You may add custom headers (e.g., **The Memory**, **The Calculation**) to better organize complex information.
