## Chapter 6: The Horde

### Scene 1: The Alarm / Sector 12 Ventilation Hub

- **Key Event:** The air in the tunnel gets hotter. The smell of burning rubber and ozone grows stronger.
- **Key Event:** "We're close to the Hub," Hatcher says, checking his geiger-counter. "Heat spike ahead."
- **Key Event:** They turn the corner and stop.
- **Key Event:** The massive circular door of the Ventilation Hub is glowing cherry-red. The thermal dampeners have failed.
- **Key Event:** "It's boiling in there," Ria says. "If we open that, we cook."
- **Key Event:** Suddenly, a sound echoes through the pipes. A high-pitched, chittering shriek.
- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris pulls out his sensors. He ignores the heat. He points the microphone at the wall.
- **Key Event:** "Fascinating," he mutters. "Listen to the frequency. It's not a scream; it's a handshake. They're triangulating our position based on the heater's output."
- **Key Event:** "Who?" Angelica asks, raising her rifle.
- **Key Event:** "The locals," Aris says. "The Blighted."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Obsessively monitors his sensors, prioritizing the collection of "baseline acoustic data" of the screams over the group's safety.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Listen to the frequency. It's not a scream; it's a handshake. They're triangulating our position based on the heater's output."

### Scene 2: The Wave / The Tunnels

- **Key Event:** The vents above them burst open. Grates clang to the floor.
- **Key Event:** They pour out. Not one or two. Hundreds.
- **Key Event:** Pale, emaciated figures. Their eyes are sewn shut. their mouths are wide, toothless maws. They move on all fours, scrambling over each other like insects.
- **Key Event:** "Back!" Hatcher shouts. "Fall back to the choke point!"
- **Key Event:** The horde surges forward. A wall of grey flesh and claws.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr racks his shotgun. He looks at the tidal wave of monsters.
- **Key Event:** "That's not a crowd," he says, spitting his matchstick. "That's a tide. And tides don't stop for brass."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "That's not a crowd. That's a tide. And tides don't stop for brass."

### Scene 3: The Stand / The Hub Entrance

- **Key Event:** They retreat to the narrow doorway of the Hub.
- **Key Event:** Ria steps to the front. She is holding a heavy-industrial welder she scavenged. It's connected to a fuel tank on her back.
- **Key Event:** "Clear the line!" she shouts.
- **Key Event:** She pulls the trigger. A jet of blue flame, three thousand degrees hot, roars into the tunnel.
- **Key Event:** The lead Blighted ignite instantly. They don't scream; they just crumble into ash.
- **Key Event:** But more push from behind, climbing over the burning bodies of their kin.
- **Key Event:** "Too many variables," Ria mutters, adjusting the fuel mix. "I need to thin the herd. Cover the left vent."
- **Key Event:** "Ria! They're flanking us!" Angelica shouts, firing short, controlled bursts into the ceiling vents.
- **Key Event:** "Let them," Ria says calmly. "I have more fuel than they have skin."
- **Key Event:** She sweeps the flame across the ceiling, melting the grate and sealing the flank.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Displays no fear, viewing the battle as a purely mechanical problem of "flow control."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Too many variables. I need to thin the herd. Cover the left vent."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Let them. I have more fuel than they have skin."

### Scene 4: The Escape / Secondary Maintenance Tunnel

- **Key Event:** The fuel gauge beeps. Low pressure.
- **Key Event:** "We're dry!" Ria announces.
- **Key Event:** "The door!" Hatcher yells. "Get the door open!"
- **Key Event:** Kaelen and Zephyr heave on the manual crank. The rusted gears groan. The heavy steel door inches upward.
- **Key Event:** They slide under it, dragging the gear.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the crate of medical supplies. It's heavy. It's slowing them down.
- **Key Event:** The Blighted are clawing at the gap. Fingers snap as the door comes down.
- **Key Event:** "Drop the meds," she orders.
- **Key Event:** "We might need those," Kaelen argues, straining under the weight.
- **Key Event:** "We can't use them if we're dead," Angelica snaps. "We need speed more. That's a command."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen hesitates, then drops the crate.
- **Key Event:** They sprint down the dark tunnel as the horde begins to tear through the steel door behind them.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Forces the group to leave behind a crate of medical supplies to move faster, choosing survival over comfort.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Drop the meds. We can't use them if we're dead. Move!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need speed more. That's a command."
