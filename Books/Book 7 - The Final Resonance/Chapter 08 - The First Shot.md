## Chapter 08: The First Shot

### Scene 1: The Escalation

- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane, growing impatient with the Sphere's silence, decides to demonstrate strength. He overrides Ria's lockout and seizes control of the Forward Railgun Battery.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane stands in his auxiliary command center in the Biolab, a sterile white room filled with dissection tables and stasis pods. His hands are buried in the interface gel of his console, which glows with a sick, pulsating green light. His eyes are rolled back, seeing the ship through the sensors. He is agitated, pacing back and forth in the digital space of the ship's network. The silence of the Sphere feels like an insult. He interprets it as a lack of respect for his status as an evolved being. He accesses the weapon systems, bypassing the safety protocols with his superior clearance. The railguns on the bow of the _Aeterna_ begin to charge, the magnetic coils humming with lethal potential. The sound vibrates through the hull, a deep, rising whine that sets teeth on edge.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane tells himself this is necessary. A predator does not negotiate with prey. He believes he is establishing dominance. He believes that by showing "Strength," he will force the Entity to respect him. His Gluttony for power blinds him to the vast difference in scale between his weapons and the enemy's. He imagines the Entity bowing to him, acknowledging him as an equal. The thought sends a shiver of pleasure down his spine. He ignores the warnings from the ship's AI about unauthorized firing. He is the Prelate. He is the law.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He sneers at the hesitation of the bridge crew, which he can sense through the network. "Cowards," he mutters. "They wait for permission to exist. I will take it." He initiates the firing sequence with a mental command.

### Scene 2: The Fire

- **Key Event:** The railguns fire. Three massive slugs of depleted uranium are accelerated to a fraction of the speed of light.
- **Detailed Description:** The recoil shudders through the entire ship. The slugs streak across the void, glowing with friction heat even in the vacuum. They are pinpricks of bright light against the darkness. They impact the Sphere. There is no explosion. The slugs simply... stop. They hit the black surface and vanish, absorbed instantly into the Vantablack material. There is no debris. No shockwave. It is as if they were deleted from reality. The surface of the Sphere ripples slightly, like a pond disturbed by a pebble, and then returns to perfect smoothness.
- **Internal Conflict:** On the bridge, Angelica watches the telemetry. Her heart sinks. She sees the energy spike on the Sphere's surface—not damage, but absorption. They didn't hurt it. They fed it. She realizes Vane has just made a catastrophic mistake. He has turned a standoff into a feeding frenzy. She slams her fist onto the console.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane, watching from the Biolab, is confused. He expected fire. He expected shattered hull plating. He cannot comprehend an enemy that simply eats kinetic energy. He runs the data again, looking for the error. There must be an error. His weapons are perfect.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Vane, you idiot! You just rang the dinner bell!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "Impossible. Physics dictates an impact. Where is the impact? Recalibrate the sensors! They are malfunctioning!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "The sensors are fine! You just fed it! Cease fire immediately!"

### Scene 3: The Response

- **Key Event:** The Sphere responds. It does not fire back. It "unfolds."
- **Detailed Description:** The smooth surface of the Sphere breaks apart into millions of smaller geometric shapes—triangles, squares, rhombuses. They peel away from the main body like a swarm of insects leaving a hive. They form a cloud of black glass that expands rapidly, moving toward the _Aeterna_. The sensors go wild, registering thousands of contacts. The cloud blocks out the stars. It moves with a terrifying, fluid grace, shifting shape as it approaches. It looks like a living thing, a massive organism made of math and void.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen watches the swarm approach. He feels a cold dread. This isn't a fleet; it's a weather system. He realizes that they aren't fighting a ship. They are fighting a force of nature. He thinks of the stories his grandmother told him about the "End Times." This looks like them. He grips the hilt of his sword, though he knows it is useless against this.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen** — He grips the edge of the console. He understands the scale of the power gap. "It's not an attack," he whispers. "It's a harvest."

- **Key Event:** The first wave of "Shards" hits the ship.
- **Detailed Description:** The geometric shapes slam into the hull. They don't explode. They latch on. They begin to vibrate, phasing through the shields as if they aren't there. The hull plating begins to dissolve under their touch, turning into grey dust that drifts away into space. The ship screams as its skin is peeled away. The sound of tearing metal echoes through the corridors. Alarms blare in every sector.
- **Internal Conflict:** Panic erupts on the lower decks. Breach alarms blare. Angelica tries to coordinate a defense, but the reports are nonsensical. "They're eating the walls!" "My rifle shoots right through them!" She realizes the rules of engagement have changed. Morality and tactics don't apply. This is simple survival. She has to keep the crew from panicking, even as she feels the panic rising in her own throat.

### Scene 4: The First Casualty

- **Key Event:** A Shard breaches the observation deck. It is a flat, triangular plane of darkness.
- **Detailed Description:** The Shard slices through the reinforced glass without slowing down. The atmosphere vents into space with a roar. A crewman, Ensign Miller, is caught in the decompression. He grabs a railing, holding on for dear life. The Shard turns toward him. It rotates, presenting its edge. It passes through him. Miller falls apart, bisected cleanly at the waist. There is no blood, only a cauterized line. The Shard absorbs his remains, glowing faintly.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane watches the feed. He is fascinated. He sees the efficiency of the kill. He doesn't see a dead man; he sees a perfect weapon. He begins recording, narrating his observations. "Subject eliminated. Energy transfer complete. Remarkable." He is entirely detached from the horror. He is already planning how to capture one.

### Scene 5: The Line

- **Key Event:** Hatcher organizes the defenses.
- **Detailed Description:** On the lower decks, **Hatcher (The Null)** is already moving, barking orders to panicking crew members. He can't fight the Shards with bullets, but he can control the chaos. He directs evacuation teams, seals compromised sections, and positions damage control parties at critical junctions. His voice cuts through the screaming alarms like a blade—calm, certain, absolute. He has seen impossible enemies before. He knows that morale kills faster than weapons.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Eyes front! If you can't shoot it, seal it! If you can't seal it, run! But run _somewhere useful_, not in circles!"
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — Demonstrates his crisis leadership; while others freeze in existential terror, he focuses on the actionable—people can still run, still seal doors, still fight to survive.
