# Chapter 14: Zephyr's Poverty

---

### Scene 1: The Loss

- **Key Event:** During a narrow escape from a structural collapse, Zephyr’s cybernetic arm is pinned and crushed, and he is forced to disconnect the linkage to survive.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Stares at the stump of his arm, which represented his entire status as a wealthy High-Deck Rogue.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "There goes two million credits. I’m just a symmetric peasant now."

### Scene 2: The Phantom

- **Key Event:** Zephyr suffers from phantom limb syndrome, accidentally reaching for his weapon or tools with an arm that is no longer there.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "I can build you a new one. Out of scrap. It won't be gold, but it will work."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Gold was the point, kid. If you’re not flashy, you’re just a target."

### Scene 3: The Utility

- **Key Event:** Zephyr is forced to adapt to a one-handed life, learning to use his "inner deck" skills (hacking, picking locks) without the aid of his high-end hardware.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Realizes his value isn't in his expensive arm but in his "rat-like" survival instincts.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Turns out the hardware was just ego. The software... that's still me."

### Scene 4: The Gift

- **Key Event:** Hatcher gives Zephyr an old, heavy-duty industrial hook meant for towing cables, which serves as a crude but effective replacement.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Notes that Zephyr looks more like a resident of the Undercity now, finally losing the last vestige of his Zenith persona.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "It's ugly. It's heavy. It’s perfect. Welcome to the Scrapyard, Goldie."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "It’s a hook. I’m a pirate now. Great. Just great."
