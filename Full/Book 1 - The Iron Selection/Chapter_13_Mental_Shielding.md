# Chapter 13: Mental Shielding

The midnight bells of the Academy were not bells. They were acoustic dampeners pulsing a low-frequency hum that signaled the end of the Cycle. For most cadets, it meant sleep. For the Highborn, it meant the day was only half over.

Angelica stood in front of the blackened weirwood doors of House Night.

Getting here had been a trial in itself. The House Night wing was located in the deepest stratum of the dormitory spire, a level reserved for the First Families. The air down here was different—recycled, scrubbed, and perfumed with something that smelled like ozone and crushed violets. It didn't smell like people. It smelled like power.

She walked down the long, vaulted corridor, her boots sinking into carpet that was thicker than her mattress. The walls were lined with portraits of the Night lineage—pale, severe men and women with eyes that seemed to track her movement. They were painted in oils that absorbed the light, making the corridor feel darker than it should have been.

At the end of the hall, a figure was polishing a brass sconce.

He was a Thrall. A servant bound to the House. He wore a grey uniform with the Night crest—a silver crescent moon—embroidered on the collar. He didn't look up as she approached. He moved with a mechanical, rhythmic efficiency.

"Excuse me," Angelica said, pausing.

The Thrall froze. He turned his head slowly. His face was blank, his eyes glazed over. He had a neural shunt visible on his temple—a 'silencer' implant.

"I'm looking for Kaelen Night's quarters," she said.

The Thrall didn't speak. He just pointed a gloved finger toward the double doors at the very end of the hall. Then he went back to polishing.

_creepy. very_creepy,_ Aeon whispered in her ear. _recommend_avoiding_eye_contact._

"Agreed," Angelica muttered.

She continued walking, the silence pressing against her ears. This was the world Kaelen had grown up in. A world of silent servants, judging ancestors, and perfect, oppressive order. It made the chaotic noise of the Silt feel almost warm by comparison.

She arrived at the doors. They were ancient, carved from blackened weirwood that must have cost a fortune to import from the agri-worlds.

She wasn't wearing her fatigues. Kaelen had ordered her to wear "neutral attire," which turned out to be a simple grey tunic and trousers that felt dangerously like prison scrubs. She had left Aeon in the dorms—or at least, his physical drone body. He was still riding shotgun in her neural link.

_hostile_environment_detected,_ he transmitted. _recommend_lethal_force_if_provoked._

"Not today, buddy," she whispered. "Today is about not getting my brain fried."

She knocked. One sharp rap.

"Enter," Kaelen's voice came from within. It wasn't loud, but it resonated in her teeth.

She pushed the door open.

The library was darker than before. The floating candelabras had been extinguished, leaving only the fireplace to light the massive room. The plasma fire was low, a sullen sphere of red embers trapped in its stasis field.

Kaelen was sitting in the high-backed velvet chair. He wasn't reading. He was just... sitting. His hands rested on the armrests, his spine perfectly straight, his eyes fixed on the empty air in front of him.

"Close the door," he said.

Angelica obeyed. The latch clicked, sealing them in the silence.

"Sit."

He pointed to a simple wooden stool placed in the center of the room. It had no back. It had no cushion. It looked like an interrogation chair.

Angelica walked over and sat down. The wood was hard. She felt exposed.

"You are late," Kaelen said.

"It's 2400 hours exactly," Angelica countered, glancing at the chronometer on the wall.

"You arrived at the door at 2359:45," Kaelen corrected. "You hesitated for fifteen seconds. Hesitation is a variable. Eliminate it."

He finally turned his head to look at her.

In the firelight, his face was a mask of shadows. The silver scar on his wrist—the twin to her own—glinted faintly.

"Tonight is not about magic," Kaelen said softly. "It is about architecture."

"Architecture?"

"The architecture of the mind," he clarified. "You have a chaotic mind, Ward. It is a scrapyard of noisy thoughts, panicked impulses, and sentimental clutter. A telepath doesn't need to break into your head; they just have to walk through the open door."

He leaned forward.

"I am going to teach you how to close the door."

"Okay," Angelica said, bracing herself. "How do we start? Do I memorize a mantra?"

Kaelen smiled. It was the same smile he had worn when he cut her arm.

"No," he said. "We start with an invasion."

He didn't move. He didn't chant. He just stared at her.

And then, he was inside.

It felt like a cold needle being pushed into the center of her forehead.

It wasn't a headache. Headaches were biological. They throbbed. This was steady, sharp, and impossibly precise. It slid past her skull, past the dura mater, and sank into the grey matter of her consciousness.

Angelica gasped. She tried to jerk her head back, but her muscles refused to obey. She was pinned by his gaze.

The needle moved. It began to sift.

She felt him flipping through her surface thoughts like someone rifling through a file cabinet.

_...the smell of the room (old paper, ozone)... the pain in her wrist... the worry about Aeon... the hunger she felt for an apple..._

"Loud," Kaelen's voice echoed, not in the room, but inside her skull. "Your thoughts scream, Ward. You project everything: fear, insecurity, calculus. A telepath could track you across the sector just by listening to the noise."

"I'm trying to block you!" she shouted, or thought she shouted.

"Trying is noise," Kaelen retorted. "Doing is silence."

The needle pushed deeper.

"Visualize a defense," he ordered.

Angelica squeezed her eyes shut. She thought of a wall. A massive, brick wall, like the blast shields in the Silt. She built it brick by brick, mortaring it with her will.

_SMASH._

Kaelen rode a wrecking ball through it in an instant. She felt the psychic debris scatter, stinging her mind.

"Too rigid," he critiqued. "Bricks break. Stone cracks under pressure."

"A firewall!" she thought desperately. She visualized streams of code, complex encryption algorithms, a rotating 256-bit cypher shield.

Kaelen bypassed it. He slipped through the gaps in the logic like smoke.

"Code dictates patterns," he murmured. "Patterns are predictable. I resolved your algorithm before you finished writing it."

The needle touched something deeper. A memory.

Angelica flinched. "Get out!"

"A shield must be fluid," Kaelen lectured, ignoring her panic. "It must be water, not stone. Water displaces. Water yields. And when the strike passes, water returns."

He pushed harder. The needle became a drill.

He was boring past the surface, past the daily clutter, aiming for the Core Memories. The things that defined who she was. The pillars of her psyche.

She felt him passing her childhood—scavenging for copper wire in the ruins, hiding from the press-gangs, the first time she fixed a generator and felt the hum of power under her hands.

"Boring," Kaelen judged. "Standard survival trauma."

He went deeper.

And then, he found it.

The sensory details hit Angelica like a physical blow. The smell of moldy foam. The taste of recycled water that hadn't been filtered properly. The dim, flickering light of a glow-rod that was running out of charge, casting long, dancing shadows on the rusted metal walls.

The Silt. Level 0.

It wasn't just a memory; it was a resurrection. She could feel the humidity on her skin, thick and cloying. She could hear the distant, rhythmic thumping of the atmospheric processors, the heartbeat of the Undercity.

She was standing over a mattress. A boy was lying there.

Leo.

He was eight years old. He was small for his age, his ribs showing through his thin skin like the cage of a bird. His face was pale, slick with sweat. His eyes—Angelica's eyes—were glassy with radiation fever.

"Angel?" he whispered. His voice was a rasp, a dry leaf scraping against stone. "I'm hungry."

Angelica felt the memory wash over her. It wasn't just a picture; it was the emotion. The crushing weight of helplessness. The terror that clawed at her throat, sharp and frantic. The desperate, burning love she had for her brother—the only good thing in a world of rust and decay.

She remembered this night. It was the night the filtration system failed in Sector 4. The radiation had leaked in, invisible and silent. They had hidden in the ventilation shaft, curled together for warmth, waiting for the all-clear that didn't come for two days.

She saw herself kneeling beside him. She saw her own hands—small, scarred, covered in grease—breaking a ration bar in half. It was a protein bar she had stolen from a dead man in the scrapyard. It was stale, hard as a rock, but it was food.

"Eat, Leo," memory-Angelica whispered, pressing the bar to his lips. "I'll fix it. I promise. I'll fix everything. I'll get us out of here."

Kaelen paused.

The needle stopped drilling. It hovered over the memory, tasting it. He absorbed the fear. He absorbed the love. He dissected the desperation.

"A sibling," Kaelen's voice said, cold and analytical. It echoed through the memory, jarring and alien. "Leo. That is your weakness. That is the leverage point."

Angelica tried to push him away. She tried to shroud the memory in mental fog, to hide her brother behind a wall of static. "Don't touch him! Get away from him!"

"If I wanted to break you," Kaelen continued, ignoring her struggles effortlessly, "I wouldn't torture you. I wouldn't burn you. I would just come here, into this memory, and I would make you watch him die. Over and over again. I would make you watch the light go out of his eyes."

The needle flared hot.

He twisted the memory. A corruption of the data.

In the vision, Leo didn't eat the bar. He seized. He coughed blood, thick and dark. His eyes rolled back into his head.

"NO!" Angelica screamed.

In the physical world, she fell off the stool. She hit the floor hard, scrambling backward, clutching her head.

But Kaelen didn't let go. He held the connection, forcing her to watch the nightmare he was weaving.

"Structure creates fragility," Kaelen whispered. "Emotion creates cracks. You love him, and that love is a handle I can grab to tear you apart."

"STOP IT!"

Something snapped in Angelica.

It wasn't fear anymore. It wasn't the cold, analyzing logic of the mechanic. It was the hot, molten rage of the sister.

How dare he?

How dare this Highborn prince, sitting in his velvet chair, touch her brother? That memory was sacred. That pain was hers.

The rage gave her focus. It burned away the panic. It burned away the "walls" and the "code."

She didn't build a shield. She didn't try to hide.

She grabbed the needle.

In the psychic plane, she visualized her own mental hand closing around the tendril of Kaelen's consciousness. It scorched her, but she didn't let go.

"You want a connection?" she hissed in her mind.

She looked at the silver scar on her wrist. The circuit. Input. Output. Ground.

He was sending a signal. But every wire has two ends.

"Let's see what you're hiding."

She didn't push him out. She pulled him _in_.

Use the momentum. Water displaces. Water returns.

She surfed the link back up the stream, flooding the channel with her own Resonance—raw, dirty, chaotic Silt-Resonance.

Kaelen's eyes widened in the physical world.

"No!" he shouted. "Do not—"

But it was too late. The circuit was closed.

Angelica wasn't the victim anymore. She was the surge protector.
The world tilted on its axis.

Angelica didn't move her physical body, but her consciousness lurched forward, riding the psychic tether Kaelen had established. It was like sliding down a razor blade. The friction was mental, a screeching static that tasted like aluminum foil, but she pushed through it.

She was entering the Void Geometry.

That was the only way to describe Kaelen's mind. It wasn't a library, or a fortress, or any of the clichéd metaphors the telepathy primers suggested.

It was a cathedral of mathematics.

Angelica found herself standing on a plane of obsidian glass. Above her, the sky was a perfect, featureless white, devoid of a sun or stars. Around her, impossible structures rose—towers that spiraled into infinity without curving, arches that supported weightless bridges, geometric shapes that shifted and recalibrated with the ticking precision of a clock.

It was beautiful. It was cold. It was terrifyingly silent.

"You are not welcome here," Kaelen's voice boomed. It came from everywhere and nowhere, vibrating through the glass floor.

The environment shifted.

The glass floor sprouted spikes. Massive, crystalline thorns shot up, aiming to impale her intruder consciousness.

"Predictable," Angelica thought.

She didn't try to dodge. She didn't try to break the spikes. She was Resonance. She was the Silt.

_Rust._

She projected the concept of decay. She visualized the salt-spray of the seawall, the corrosive humidity of the ventilation shafts, the relentless entropy that ate away at everything in the Undercity.

The obsidian spikes didn't shatter. They oxided.

In seconds, the pristine black glass turned to flaky orange dust. The structure of his defense collapsed under the weight of her chaotic imposition.

Angelica walked through the crumbling remains of his trap.

"You think order is strength?" she projected, shouting into the white void. "Order is fragile. One variable changes, and the whole equation breaks."

She looked for the core.

In the distance, suspended in the center of a massive floating dodecahedron, was a pulsating light. It was cold, blue, and contained.

The Core.

She sprinted toward it. The "distance" was irrelevant here; she moved at the speed of thought.

As she approached the dodecahedron, the defenses became more aggressive. The air turned to liquid nitrogen. Mathematical formulas—complex differential equations meant to calculate trajectory and force—manifested as glowing sigils that tried to bind her limbs.

She tore through them. She didn't solve the equations; she introduced a denominator of zero. She broke the logic.

She smashed into the side of the dodecahedron. It hummed with power. She placed her hands on the surface. It burned—a freezing burn, like touching dry ice.

"Let's see what made you," she whispered.

She pushed her Resonance into the shape. She flooded his orderly, silent mind with the noise of the Silt—the screaming of metal, the roar of the furnaces, the chaotic, beating heart of a million people fighting to survive.

The dodecahedron cracked.

A fault line zigzagged across the surface. Then another. Then another.

With a sound like a breaking glacier, the structure shattered.

The white void vanished.

The obsidian floor vanished.

Angelica fell.

She fell through the darkness, past swirling clouds of memory—Kaelen fencing, Kaelen studying, Kaelen meditating—until she hit the bottom.

She landed on a plush, red carpet.

The smell hit her instantly. It was overpowering. Sweet, cloying gardenias mixed with the metallic tang of copper and the sharp, chemical reek of ozone.

She was in a room. A physical room, reconstructed perfectly from memory.

It was elegant. High ceilings, dark wood paneling, tapestries that depicted the history of House Night. A fire crackled in a marble hearth.

In the center of the room was a chair.

It was a small chair, sized for a child. Leather straps were bolted to the arms and legs.

And a boy was strapped into it.

He couldn't have been more than eight years old. He had Kaelen's dark hair, his sharp jawline, but his eyes were wide, filled with a terror so raw it made the air vibrate. He was struggling against the restraints, his small chest heaving, but he wasn't making a sound.

He had learned not to scream.

Standing over him was a woman.

She was tall, painfully thin, and terrifyingly beautiful. She wore a gown of midnight blue silk that pooled around her feet like oil. Her hair was pulled back in a severe bun, revealing a face that was a sharper, colder version of Kaelen's.

Matriarch Lilith Night.

Angelica had seen holos of her. But the holos didn't capture the presence. The woman felt like a black hole—a singularity of ambition and cruelty that warped the light around her.

In her hand, she held a tool.

It wasn't a weapon. It was an instrument. A soldering iron, modified with a fine, needle-point tip. The coil at the base was glowing a cheerful, cherry red.

Heat radiated from it, distorting the air.

"You are too emotional, Kaelen," Lilith said. Her voice was soft, melodic, almost affectionate. It was the voice of a mother comforting a child. "I reviewed the sparring tapes. You hesitated. You felt pity for the sparring drone."

"It... it looked like a dog," the boy whispered. His voice trembled.

"It was a machine," Lilith corrected gently. "But even if it were a dog, hesitation is a flaw. Emotion is a leak in the hull. It sinks the ship. We must accept the necessary corrections."

She brought the iron closer.

The boy flinched, pressing himself back against the leather. "Mother, please. I won't do it again. I promise."

"I know you won't," she soothed. "Because I will cauterize the leak."

She didn't strike in anger. That was the worst part. There was no rage in her face, no sadistic glee. There was only the calm, clinical detachment of a surgeon removing a tumor.

She pressed the glowing tip of the iron to the boy's chest, right over his heart.

_HISSSSS._

The sound of burning flesh was loud in the silent room. Smoke curled up, carrying that terrible, cooked-meat smell.

The boy screamed.

It wasn't a silent scream this time. It was a primal, shattering shriek of agony.

Angelica screamed with him.

She felt it. Because she was in his mind, because the link was open, she felt the phantom pain searing into her own chest. She felt the skin blister, the nerves scream and die, the heat burrowing down toward the ribcage.

But more than the physical pain, she felt the psychological break.

She felt the trust dying. She felt the love for his mother curdling into terror, and then into a cold, hard knot of hatred. She felt the boy's mind frantically building walls, shutting down emotions, rerouting neural pathways to bypass the pain centers.

He wasn't born a sociopath. He wasn't born cold.

He was _forged_.

Lilith held the iron there for five full seconds. An eternity.

"There," she said, pulling it away. "The wound will heal. The lesson will remain. Silence, Kaelen. Silence is strength."

The boy slumped in the chair, sobbing quietly, gasping for air.

Lilith turned. She looked straight at Angelica.

It was impossible. This was a memory. She shouldn't be able to see the intruder.

But Lilith Night's eyes—black, bottomless pools—locked onto Angelica's.

"You shouldn't be here, little rat," the memory-Lilith hissed.

The world exploded.

Kaelen roared.

It wasn't a word. It was a projection of pure force.

He threw her out of his head.

The connection snapped with the violence of a breaking cable. The psychic backlash hit Angelica in the chest, lifting her off her feet. She flew backward, her limbs pinwheeling, until she slammed into one of the heavy bookshelves.

Books cascaded down around her—heavy, leather-bound tomes on history and strategy—burying her in a slide of knowledge.

She gasped, the wind knocked out of her. Her head was spinning, her vision blurring at the edges. Tinnitus, high and sharp, drilled into her ears.

"Get out!"

Kaelen was standing.

The composure was gone. The "void geometry" was gone. He was shaking. His hands were clutched to his chest, right over his heart—the place where the memory-iron had burned him. His face was ashen, drained of all blood, looking more like a corpse than a prince.

But his eyes were alive. They were wide, frantic, and burning with a lethal mix of humiliation and fury.

Angelica groaned, pushing a heavy book off her legs. _Advanced Tactics: Siege Breaking._ Irony.

She scrambled to her feet, using the shelf for support. Her knees were jelly. Her nose was bleeding—a warm, steady trickle running down over her lip.

"I saw her," Angelica rasped. Her voice sounded wrecked. "Your mother. She... she did that to you."

"I SAID GET OUT!"

Kaelen swept his hand through the air.

A wave of telekinetic force, unrefined and raw, smashed into the furniture. The heavy oak table in the center of the room flipped over as if it weighed nothing. The velvet chair—his throne—skidded across the floor and crashed into the fireplace, sending sparks and embers spraying onto the rug.

Angelica ducked as a brass astrolabe flew past her head, shattering against the stone wall.

"You're not cold," she said, wiping the blood from her lip. "You're just burned."

Kaelen froze.

The telekinetic storm stopped as abruptly as it had begun. The silence that rushed back into the room was heavy, suffocating.

He looked at her. Really looked at her.

And for the first time since she had met him, Angelica Ward was truly afraid.

He wasn't looking at her like a cadet. He wasn't looking at her like a rival. He was looking at her like a loose end. A liability. A leak in the hull.

He took a step toward her. Then another.

He moved with the predator grace she had seen in the sparring ring, but now it was jagged, unstable. His hand went to his belt. He wasn't wearing his saber, but he had a jagged letter opener on the fallen desk—a piece of obsidian, sharp as glass.

He picked it up.

"You saw nothing," Kaelen whispered.

"I saw everything," Angelica corrected, her back pressing against the books. She couldn't run. He was faster. She couldn't fight. He was stronger. "I saw the lesson. 'Emotion is a leak.' That's what she told you."

"Stop talking."

"She tortured you until you broke. She made you this way."

Kaelen closed the distance. He was five feet away now. Four. The obsidian blade caught the dying light of the fire.

"I am perfected," he hissed, his voice trembling with the effort to maintain control. "I am the ideal. I am the silence."

"You're a victim, Kaelen," Angelica said. She didn't shout it. She said it with a quiet, brutal certainty. "You're just a kid who got hurt by the person who was supposed to protect him."

He lunged.

Angelica didn't flinch. She didn't have time. She just looked at him, holding his gaze, refusing to give him the satisfaction of seeing her fear.

The blade stopped an inch from her throat.

Kaelen's hand was shaking so hard the obsidian blurred. His breathing was ragged, harsh gasps tearing from his throat. Sweat beaded on his forehead, sticking his dark hair to his skin.

He wanted to do it. She could see the calculation running behind his eyes. _Kill her. Claim it was an accident. Claim she attacked. Eliminate the witness. Protect the secret._

It would be so easy.

But he couldn't.

"Why?" he choked out. "Why did you pull? Why didn't you just block?"

"Because walls break," Angelica said, quoting him. "Water doesn't."

She reached up, very slowly, and touched the scar on her own wrist. The Silver Scar. The bond that connected them.

"And because we're connected, Night. You opened the door. You let me in."

Kaelen stared at the scar. Then he looked at his own wrist. The silver line seemed to pulse in the dim light.

He lowered the blade.

The tension broke, leaving them both exhausted. Kaelen stumbled back, leaning against the overturned desk. He dropped the letter opener. It clattered on the floor, sounding impossibly loud.

"If you speak of this," Kaelen said, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. "If you breathe a word of what you saw... to the instructors, to your squad, to anyone..."

"I know," Angelica said. "You'll kill me."

"I will destroy you," Kaelen corrected. "I will burn everything you love. I will find your brother in the Silt and I will make you watch him die."

It was the same threat as before. But this time, it lacked the calculated venom. It sounded defensive. Desperate.

"You won't," Angelica said.

She pushed herself off the bookshelf. She was dizzy, her head pounding with a migration headache that would probably last for days, but her footing was steady.

She walked past him toward the door.

She stopped with her hand on the latch.

"I won't tell anyone," she said, not looking back. "Not because I'm afraid of you. But because I don't owe you anything. Not even my pity."

She opened the door.

"Get some sleep, Night. You look like hell."

The hallway was quiet.

Not the quiet of the Silt, which was a pause between noises—the breath held before the compressor turned on, the silence before the scream. This was the quiet of a tomb. Or a bank vault. A silence bought with credits and enforced by sound-dampening fields.

Angelica walked down the center of the corridor, her boots making no sound on the plush carpet.

She felt... hollow.

The adrenaline that had fueled her in the study was gone, leaving behind a profound exhaustion that settled in her marrow. It wasn't just physical fatigue; it was spiritual. She felt like she had just run a marathon through a minefield.

_Status report,_ Aeon's voice chirped in her ear.

She winced. Even his digital voice felt too loud.

"Not now, Aeon," she whispered.

_biometric_scan_complete. heart_rate: 110bpm. cortisol_levels: elevated. slight_pupil_dilation. diagnosis: acute_stress_response. did_the_hostile_engage?_

"He engaged," Angelica muttered. "It was... complicated."

_define_complicated. did_you_sustain_damage?_

She touched her forehead. The needle sensation was gone, but a ghost of it remained—a phantom pressure between her eyes.

"No physical damage," she said. "But he got inside. He saw things."

_unauthorized_access_detected. protocol_breach. should_i_initiate_countermeasures? i_can_hack_the_dormitory_environmental_controls. i_can_lower_the_oxygen_levels_in_his_room_to_induce_hypoxia._

Angelica almost laughed. It was a dark, brittle sound.

"No, Aeon. Stand down. No hypoxia."

_confirming. standing_down. but_keeping_file_active: 'operation_night_fall'._

She reached the lift and pressed the call button. While she waited, she leaned her forehead against the cool metal of the wall.

She had won. Technically. She had turned his attack back on him. She had humiliated him. She had gained leverage.

But it didn't feel like a victory.

It felt like she had just kicked a wounded dog.

"He's been tortured," she whispered to the empty air. "His own mother burned the emotions out of him."

_data_query: matriarch_lilith_night?_

"Yeah."

_accessing_public_records... matirarch_lilith_night. head_of_house_night. known_for: ruthless_efficiency, zero_tolerance_policy, and the 'night_doctrine'. quote: 'the_void_does_not_feel. the_void_consumes.'_

"Fits," Angelica said.

The lift arrived with a soft _ding_. She stepped inside.

She looked at her reflection in the polished metal of the doors. She looked tired. There were heavy bags under her eyes, and her skin was pale. But her eyes...

Her eyes looked older.

In the Silt, you grew up fast because you had to. You learned that hunger was pain, that cold was death, and that trust was a currency you couldn't afford to spend. But you also learned that family was everything. You protected your own.

Kaelen Night had grown up in a palace. He had never been hungry. He had never been cold.

But he had never been safe.

Every meal was a test. Every conversation was a trap. And his family wasn't a shelter; it was a crucible.

"He's alone," Angelica realized.

It wasn't an excuse. It didn't make him less dangerous. A starving wolf is still a wolf—in fact, it's the most dangerous kind. But understanding the starvation changed how you dealt with the wolf. You didn't just beat it. You had to understand _why_ it was biting.

The lift opened on her floor.

She walked to her dorm room. The door hissed open, recognizing her bio-signature.

Inside, the room was dark. Ria was asleep in the bottom bunk, a chaotic lump under the blankets. Her breathing was a soft, rhythmic snore that sounded like a saw cutting through softwood.

It was the most comforting sound Angelica had ever heard.

She didn't turn on the lights. She stripped off her "neutral attire"—throwing the tunic into the recycler with more force than necessary—and pulled on an oversized t-shirt.

She climbed into the top bunk, her muscles protesting every movement.

Before she lay down, she grabbed her datapad from the shelf she'd welded to the wall. She needed to see it. After Kaelen had twisted the memory, after he'd made her watch Leo die in her mind, she needed the reality.

She brought up the morning's feed. Leo, eating a green apple, looking out at the nebula. Alive. Safe. Real.

The image burned away the nightmare Kaelen had tried to plant.

"You can't touch him," she whispered to the memory of the Shadow Prince. "He's out of reach."

_goodnight_angelica,_ Aeon whispered. _i_will_maintain_vigil._

"Thanks, buddy," she murmured. "Wake me if the world ends."

She closed her eyes.

She expected to lie awake for hours, replaying the scene in the study, analyzing every word, every look. But exhaustion pulled her under like a riptide.

One moment she was staring at the ceiling. The next, she was gone.

---

She was walking through the Silt.

But it wasn't right. The geometry was wrong.

The rusty gantries twisted into impossible loops. The ventilation shafts spiraled into the sky like the towers of a cathedral. The mud under her boots was black obsidian glass, slick and cold.

"Angelica," a voice called.

She turned.

Leo was standing there. But he wasn't sick. He was wearing a House Night uniform—black velvet, silver embroidery. He held a soldering iron in his hand.

"Silence is strength," Leo said. His eyes were black pools.

"No," Angelica whispered. "That's not you."

"Emotion is a leak," Leo continued, raising the iron. "We have to fix it."

He lunged.

Angelica tried to run, but the obsidian mud held her fast. It sucked at her boots, dragging her down.

She looked up. The sky was white. A perfect, featureless void.

And sitting on a throne in the sky, looking down at her with cold, dead eyes, was Kaelen.

But he was crying. Tears of blood ran down his face, sizzling when they hit the obsidian floor.

"Help me," the sky-Kaelen whispered.

"I can't!" she shouted. "You tried to kill me!"

"I am the silence," he wept.

The tears hit the obsidian floor and hissed, releasing plumes of silver steam that smelled like ozone. The steam twisted into shapes—faces of the cadets she had beaten, the faces of the press-gangs, the face of the dead man she had stolen the ration bar from.

Leo pressed the iron to her chest.

She didn't feel the burn. She felt... cold. A freezing, numbing cold that spread from her heart out to her limbs. It turned her blood to ice. It stopped her lungs.

"Don't fight it, Angel," Leo whispered, but his voice was layered, echoing with Lilith Night's melodic cadence. "To feel is to break. To be cold is to endure."

"I don't want to be cold," she tried to say, but her lips were frozen shut.

She looked down.

Her chest wasn't burning. It was cracking. Like glass.

A spiderweb of fractures spread from the point of contact, racing across her skin. Through the cracks, she didn't see blood or bone. She saw gears. She saw wires. She saw the dusty, frantic machinery of a clock that was winding down.

"You are just a machine that thinks it's a girl," the sky-Kaelen thundered. "Turn off the switch."

The obsidian mud rose up. It wrapped around her legs, heavy and suffocating. It wasn't just mud; it was data. Binary code, scrolling zeros and ones that looked like maggots. They ate at her boots, dissolving the leather, trying to rewrite her code.

_Reformat,_ the mud whispered. _Reboot. Delete._

Angelica struggled. She tried to find her anger—the sister-rage that had saved her in the study—but it was gone, frozen under the ice. She was just a mechanic who couldn't fix herself.

"Patterns break," Leo said, his face warping into Lilith Night's. The skin stretched and tore, revealing the beautiful, terrible face of the Matriarch. "Water yields. But ice... ice shatters."

The cracks spread to her neck. To her face. She was shattering.

"NO!"

Angelica woke up gasping.

She sat bolt upright in bed, her hand clutching her chest. Her heart was hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. She was drenched in cold sweat.

The room was dark. Ria was still snoring below her. The chrono on the wall read 0400.

She touched her chest. No cracks. No burn. Just the steady, frantic beat of her own heart.

But she could still feel the cold.

It wasn't just a nightmare. She knew what nightmares felt like—she had them about the collapse, about the press-gangs, about running out of air. They were scary, but they were _her_ fears.

This felt... alien.

The image of the white sky. The sensation of the obsidian mud. The specific, paralyzing cold.

That wasn't her. That was him.

She looked at her wrist. The Silver Scar was faint in the darkness, a pale line against her skin.

"Barricades," she whispered to the darkness. "I need better barricades."

Because Kaelen was right about one thing. He had opened a door. But he hadn't just let himself in.

He had left it open.

And now, the draft was coming through.

Angelica lay back down, but she didn't close her eyes. She stared at the ceiling, visualized a wall—thick, reinforced duracrete, covered in graffiti and rust—and built it, brick by imaginary brick, around her mind.

She worked until the sun came up.

She didn't sleep again.
