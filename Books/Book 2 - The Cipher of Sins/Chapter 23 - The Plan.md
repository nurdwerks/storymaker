## Chapter 23: The Plan

### Scene 1: The Cylinder Data / Sewers beneath Sector 7

- **Key Event:** Hiding in the "Bile Ducts," the team accesses more data from the Cylinder. A video log from Elena Valerius reveals that the Zenith's "Resonance" is actually a lethal radiation leak from a failing engine core.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — She discovers that the entire social and biological order of the ship is built on a literal radioactive catastrophe.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elena Valerius:** "The 'Resonance'... it's a leak in the primary shielding. ... It's what powers their 'miracles,' but it's killing every living thing on this vessel slowly."

### Scene 2: The Broadcast / Sewers

- **Key Event:** Elena's log warns that the ship is on a collision course with a gas giant. Angelica decides to use the analog Emergency Broadcast Tower in Sector 4 to bypass Vane's digital control and tell the whole ship the truth.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — She shifts her goal from mere survival to saving the ship, intending to destroy the Founders' "PR" with the raw truth.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "If we tell the truth, the lie dies. And Vane dies with it. We don't just fight for a sector. We fight for the ship."
