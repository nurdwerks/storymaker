# Character Profile: Navigator Starla

**Archetype:** The Star-Gazer / The Dreamer
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Refusal to look at the grim "ground" of reality; she lives only for the "Destination").
**Virtue Mask:** HOPE (She frames her fear of the present as "Looking toward the Stars").

## I. Role in the Story

Starla is the woman who stares at the stars and discusses the "Destination" with Torin. She represents the idealism of the past.

- **The Hope:** She and Torin share a vision for the future that Angelica, who knows the grim reality of the Zenith, cannot join.
- **The Fear:** She looks at Angelica's "future-tech" (magic/augmented) with terror, calling it an "abomination." To her, Angelica is not a savior, but a symptom of a world that went wrong.

## II. Fundamental Change

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** **The Blinding.** **Location:** Book 6, Chapter 32 ("The Warning"). During the final orbital bombardment, a nuclear proximity burst detonates outside the observation deck. Starla, staring at the stars, has her retinas burned out by the flash. She is permanently blinded.
- **Impact on Torin:** Torin loses his "Visionary." Without Starla to point him toward the stars, he loses his sense of purpose. He begins to see the ship not as a vessel for a journey, but as a tomb for the survivors.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Hope" for the Destination is lost. The crew stops looking at the star-charts and starts looking at their dwindling rations, leading to a state of existential despair.
