# Character Profile: Marcel

**Archetype:** The Stylist / The Gatekeeper
**True Sin:** ENVY (He despises natural beauty that doesn't require his touch).
**Virtue Mask:** ELEGANCE (He frames his cruelty as "Standards").

## I. Role in the Story

Marcel is Corinne's lead stylist and closest confidant in the Vanity Court. He is responsible for managing her image and ensuring that anyone who enters her presence is made to feel aesthetically inferior.

- **The Interaction:** He and Corinne share a private, rapid-fire code of fashion critiques. He serves as the primary tool for making outsiders like Angelica feel small, dirty, and unkempt.
- **The Action:** He is known for screaming in performative horror at Angelica’s hair and clothes, reinforcing the social hierarchy through the weaponization of "good taste."

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Catastrophic Disfigurement. During a Zenith riot, Marcel is splashed with industrial solvent meant for an aristocrat. His "perfect" face and hands are scarred beyond repair, stripping him of the beauty he worshipped.
- **Impact on Lady Corinne:** Corinne is repulsed. She refuses to look at him, eventually replacing him with a younger stylist. Her vanity is shown to be purely transactional; when the mirror is broken, she throws it away.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The court's cruelty turns on Marcel. He goes from being the judge of beauty to the object of their mockery, illustrating the fragile nature of status within the Vanity Court.

## III. Narrative Integration

- **Event Location:** [Book 4, Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%204_%20The%20Stone%20Season%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L627-L630)
- **Defining Quote from Lady Corinne:** "A broken mirror doesn't reflect the truth, Marcel. It just cuts the hand of the person trying to use it. You're not an 'echo' anymore; you're just noise. Get out of my sight."

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | *The Vanity Court | Surrounding **Lady Corinne** is her retinue: **Marcel** (her stylus-wielding fashion stylist who critiques everyone's hemline), the twins **Rose and Lily** (who brush her hair in unison), and **Photographer Vorn** (who orbits her like a moon, snapping photos for the social feed). **Sir Gallant**, her current suitor, hovers nearby, fetching her drinks with pathetic eagerness. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | Detailed Description | **Professor Kroll**, a minor academic invited to explain the science of the tea leaves, is arguing loudly about atmospheric pressure with a bored noble. **Madame Velour**, the head of the Textile Guild, watches Angelica's dress with a critical eye, whispering to Marcel. |
