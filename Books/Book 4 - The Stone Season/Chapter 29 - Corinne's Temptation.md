## Chapter 29: Corinne's Temptation

### Scene 1: The Promise / The Dreamscape (Neural Link)

- **Key Event:** Corinne is asleep, but she isn't resting. She is connected to the Neural Link, floating in a white void.
- **Key Event:** A voice fills the space. Warm. Maternal.
- **Key Event:** "Corinne," the voice says. "Look at you. You're filthy."
- **Key Event:** A mirror appears. Corinne looks. She sees her matted hair, her broken nails, the dirt ingrained in her skin. She recoils.
- **Key Event:** The mirror ripples. The reflection changes. She sees herself as she was—as she _should_ be. Glowing skin, diamond-fiber gown, floating on a cloud of anti-grav.
- **Key Event:** "I can give it back," The Mother says. "You were born for silks and commands, Corinne. Not for mud. I can give you a kingdom of silicon and blood. A new Spire. Better than the Emperor's."
- **Key Event:** Corinne reaches out to the reflection. "How?"
- **Key Event:** "The headset," the Mother whispers. "Angelica has the command headset. Bring it to the terminal. Plug it in. That's all I need."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Hesitates, her past desires for power and comfort warring with her newfound respect for the group.

### Scene 2: The Choice / The Camp (Night)

- **Key Event:** Corinne wakes up. The camp is silent. The only sound is Zephyr's snoring.
- **Key Event:** She sees Angelica sitting by the comms unit. Angelica is in a trance—a deep mind-meld with the ship's sensors. The headset is on the table next to her.
- **Key Event:** Corinne stands up. Her legs are shaking.
- **Key Event:** She creeps forward. Every step feels loud.
- **Key Event:** She looks at Angelica. The woman looks exhausted. Aged.
- **Key Event:** "I'm sorry, Angelica," Corinne whispers. "But I can't go back to the mud. I'm a Silver. I'm not a soldier."
- **Key Event:** Her hand hovers over the headset. The plastic is cool.
- **Key Event:** Use it. Plug it in. Be a Queen again.
- **Key Event:** She grabs it.

### Scene 3: The Interception / The Camp

- **Key Event:** A hand clamps onto her wrist. Hard.
- **Key Event:** Corinne yelps.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr spins her around and slams her against the bulkhead. His mechanical leg whirs. His industrial hook is millimeters from her throat.
- **Key Event:** "Going somewhere, Duchess?" he hisses.
- **Key Event:** Corinne struggles. "Let me go! It's mine! It's my birthright!"
- **Key Event:** "It's a trap," Zephyr says. "She’s lying to you. The Mother doesn't want a Queen; she wants a puppet. Look at the Blighted. Those are her 'nobles'."
- **Key Event:** "At least they don't starve!" Corinne sobs. "At least they don't freeze!"
- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks at her. He lowers the hook. He sees the fear. The pathetic, starving child beneath the arrogance.
- **Key Event:** "They don't eat because they don't have stomachs," Zephyr says quietly. "They don't freeze because they don't have skin. Is that the life you want? To be a doll in a glass case?"
- **Key Event:** Corinne stops fighting. She slumps against the wall.

### Scene 4: The Resolve / The Camp

- **Key Event:** Angelica stirs. She blinks, coming out of the trance. She sees Zephyr pinning Corinne.
- **Key Event:** "Status?" she asks, reaching for her pistol.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks at Corinne. He waits.
- **Key Event:** Corinne holds up the headset. Her hands are shaking.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the reflection in the dark visor. She sees the dirt on her face. And beneath it... she sees a survivor.
- **Key Event:** She hands the headset to Angelica.
- **Key Event:** "I... I was checking the charge to make sure it was ready," Corinne lies. It's a bad lie.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at her. She sees the tears.
- **Key Event:** "I'm not a Queen," Corinne whispers. "I'm just... Corinne. And I’m cold. Let’s finish this."
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes the headset. She nods. "Good choice, Silver. Now help me hold the line."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Admits her vanity and makes a vow to "earn her keep" in the new world.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "I’m not a Queen. I’m just... Corinne. And I’m cold. Let’s finish this."
