### Scene 1: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** The Zenith receives a massive, recursive data packet containing a star map to a destination called "Sanctuary," which requires the AI Figment to sacrifice himself to sanitize a logic virus within the signal.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Devastated by the loss of Figment, her AI companion, questioning if the destination is worth the cost.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Figment:** "It's been real, Liz. Or... you know. Whatever reality is."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "He's gone. He ate the virus."

- **Key Event:** The crew is divided over whether to follow the map to Sanctuary, with Ironwood convinced it's their birthright and Hatcher warning it's a lure.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Displays religious-like fervor for the "Founders" and the idea of reclaiming Earth 2.0.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "It's Earth 2.0. It's what we were promised. It's what the Zenith was built to find."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "A lighthouse warns you of rocks. Or, if the keeper is a bastard, it guides you to the wreckers."
