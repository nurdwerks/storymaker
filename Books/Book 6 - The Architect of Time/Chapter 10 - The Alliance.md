## Chapter 10: The Alliance

### Scene 1: The Pitch / The Elder's Circle

- **Key Event:** The fire in the center of the hut is dying. The Elders sit in a circle, their faces grim.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands in the middle. She feels like she is on trial.
- **Key Event:** "We cannot do this," Ragnar says. He crosses his massive arms. "You want us to drag metal from the swamp. To build a tower to the sky. While we are starving."
- **Key Event:** "We are surviving," Angelica corrects. "I am offering you living."
- **Key Event:** "You are offering us death," another Elder spits. "The Hunters will see us. The noise will draw them."
- **Key Event:** "They are coming anyway," Angelica says. "You think hiding in the mud will save you forever? They are hunting you to extinction."
- **Key Event:** "We have survived for ten generations," Ragnar growls. "We know the jungle. We know silence."
- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes words aren't enough. They are pragmatic. They need proof.
- **Key Event:** She takes Torin's glasses from his face. "Hey!" he protests.
- **Key Event:** She holds the thick lens up to a beam of sunlight coming through the thatch roof. She focuses the beam on the dry kindling of the fire pit.
- **Key Event:** A moment passes. Then—smoke. Then—flame.
- **Key Event:** The Elders gasp. They have only ever made fire with flint and friction. This is magic.
- **Key Event:** Angelica hands the glasses back to Torin.
- **Key Event:** "Fire was impossible until someone sparked it," she says, her voice ringing in the silence. "Flying is impossible, until you build wings. I am the spark, Ragnar. Let me show you how to burn."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She uses her knowledge as a "spark" to challenge their concept of the impossible.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Fire was impossible until someone sparked it. Flying is impossible, until you build wings. I am the spark, Ragnar. Let me show you how to burn."

### Scene 2: The Agreement / The Elder's Circle

- **Key Event:** Ragnar stares at the fire. He looks at Angelica. He sees the predator in her eyes. And he respects it.
- **Key Event:** "What do you need?" he asks.
- **Key Event:** "I need muscle," Angelica says. "I need miners. Builders. Warriors."
- **Key Event:** She points to Torin. "He is the Mind. He understands the old machines. He can translate."
- **Key Event:** She points to herself. "I am the Soul. I have the vision. I have the math."
- **Key Event:** She points to Ragnar. "You are the Body. You have the strength."
- **Key Event:** "A Triumvirate," Torin whispers. "Like the old stories."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar nods slowly. "The Body, the Mind, and the Soul. It is... balanced."

### Scene 3: The Handshake / The Elder's Circle

- **Key Event:** Ragnar stands. He is a giant next to her.
- **Key Event:** He holds out his hand. It is scarred, rough as bark.
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes it. Her hand disappears in his.
- **Key Event:** Torin places his hand on top of theirs.
- **Key Event:** "To the sky," Ragnar says.
- **Key Event:** "To the stars," Angelica corrects.
- **Key Event:** They shake. The pact is sealed.
- **Key Event:** In that moment, Angelica feels the weight of destiny settle on her shoulders. She isn't just a survivor anymore. She is the Architect.
- **Key Event:** She has just founded the civilization that will one day build the _Zenith_. She is creating her own history.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She commits to a new destiny as the Architect of a prehistoric civilization.
