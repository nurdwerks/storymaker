## Chapter 43: The Return

### Scene 1: The Comms / Bridge, The _Zenith_ (Future Timeline)

- **Key Event:** The tactical map is a sea of red. The Hunter Fleet, led by the _Devourer_, has surrounded the _Zenith_. The ship's shields are at 4%.
- **Key Event:** General Ironwood grips the command rail. He looks older, tired. "Divert power from life support to forward batteries. If they breach the hull, we won't need air anyway."
- **Key Event:** Suddenly, the comms officer shouts. "General! Massive energy spike detected. Sector 4... it's a rift!"
- **Key Event:** An unknown signal cuts through the static. It overrides the Hunter jamming frequencies. It is clear, sharp, and unmistakably arrogant.
- **Key Event:** "This is the _Aeterna_ to _Zenith_ Command. You're drifting a little to the left, Ironwood."
- **Key Event:** Ironwood freezes. He knows that voice. But it sounds... wrong. Older. Like gravel grinding against steel.
- **Key Event:** "Identify," he barks.
- **Key Event:** The main viewscreen flickers. A face appears. It is Angelica Ward. But not the girl who left twenty years ago. This woman has white hair streaked with grey. A scar runs from her temple to her jaw. Her eyes are not fearful; they are predators' eyes.
- **Key Event:** "It's me, Ironwood," the woman says. She leans back in a captain's chair that looks like it was built from the bones of a star. "Or, the version of me that is twenty years older and significantly less patient."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's me, Ironwood. Or, the version of me that is twenty years older and significantly less patient."

### Scene 2: The Age / Bridge, The _Zenith_

- **Key Event:** The bridge crew stares in silence.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night steps forward. He looks at the screen. He sees the woman he... tolerated. The woman he protected.
- **Key Event:** He sees the toll. The twenty years of exile. The lines around her mouth. The hardness in her jaw.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Kaelen):** Time travel isn't a straight line. It's a trade. She traded her youth for a weapon. He feels a cold knot of horror in his stomach. To him, she left five minutes ago. To her, he is a ghost from a past life.
- **Key Event:** "Angelica?" he whispers.
- **Key Event:** The woman on the screen looks at him. Her expression softens, just for a fraction of a second. "Hello, Kaelen. Try not to get shot this time. I'm fresh out of bacta-patches."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen** — He is horrified by how much Angelica has changed in what felt like seconds to him. He realizes the cost of her mission wasn't just danger; it was her life.

### Scene 3: The Command / The _Aeterna_ Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica spins her chair. Her hands fly across a holographic interface that makes the _Zenith_'s tech look like stone tablets.
- **Key Event:** "Transferring tactical command to _Aeterna_," she says. It's not a request.
- **Key Event:** "Now wait a minute," Ironwood starts.
- **Key Event:** "Silence, General," Angelica snaps. "I have spent two decades building a ship specifically designed to kill these bastards. You are fighting with a flashlight. I brought a supernova."
- **Key Event:** She taps a command. The _Aeterna_’s weapons ports open. They glow with a terrifying violet light—Resonance-infused plasma.
- **Key Event:** "All ships, form up on my wake. We are punching a hole through the blockade."
- **Key Event:** The crew of the _Zenith_ obeys instinctively. The authority in her voice is absolute. She isn't a Princess anymore. She is a Warlord.

### Scene 4: The Statement / The _Aeterna_ Bridge

- **Key Event:** The Hunter ships realize something is wrong. They turn their turrets toward the new arrival.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches them on her screen. She remembers the jungle. The starvation. The years of eating algae paste and sleeping with a knife.
- **Key Event:** She remembers Torin.
- **Key Event:** Her eyes narrow. She doesn't feel mercy. She feels a cold, burning need for closure.
- **Key Event:** "Target the lead cruiser," she tells the computer. "Primary ignition."
- **Key Event:** "Firing solution locked," the computer chimes.
- **Key Event:** Angelica leans forward. She presses the rune on her console.
- **Key Event:** "I'm back," she whispers. "And I'm pissed."
- **Key Event:** The _Aeterna_ fires. A beam of pure, concentrated time-energy rips through space. It hits the Hunter ship. The ship doesn't explode; it _ages_. The metal rusts in seconds. The hull crumbles into dust. The reactor containment fails.
- **Key Event:** "Burn them out of the sky," she commands.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm back. And I'm pissed. ... Burn them out of the sky."
