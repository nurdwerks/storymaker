### Scene 3: The Verdict

- **Key Event:** Angelica declares Aris "guilty" but suspends the sentence, effectively making him a "prisoner who is useful."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Threatens to kill Aris personally if he treats another person as a "variable."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If you treat one more person as a variable... I will kill you myself. Not as a judge. As an executioner. Do you understand?"

- **Key Event:** The mob disperses, but the trust between Angelica and the survivors is permanently shattered, as they now see her as "Zenith trash."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're soft, Ward. You should have let them tear him apart. You're becoming one of them. You're becoming Vane."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I need his brain. I don't need his soul."
