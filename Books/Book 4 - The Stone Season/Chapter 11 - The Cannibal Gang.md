## Chapter 11: The Cannibal Gang

### Scene 1: The Ambush / The Lower Tunnels

- **Key Event:** The group is ambushed by a gang of "Cannibals" in the lower maintenance tunnels.
- **Detailed Description:** The tunnel is narrow, wet, and lit only by the flickering red of emergency lights. The group moves in a tactical line—Ria on point, Hatcher rear guard, Angelica and the civilians in the center. The attack comes from above. Grates in the ceiling burst open, and bodies drop down—emaciated, feral men and women armed with crude clubs and sharpened pipes. They do not scream; they hiss. They are the "Cannibal Gang," survivors who have broken the ultimate taboo to stay alive. Their teeth are filed to points. Their skin is painted with ash and blood.
- **Detailed Description:** The fighting is close-quarters and brutal. Ria uses her rifle as a club, smashing skulls. Hatcher uses his knives. The smell of the attackers is overwhelming—unwashed bodies, rot, and the copper tang of old blood.
- **Key Event:** **Rookie**, a young soldier from Ironwood's guard who joined them, hesitates.
- **Detailed Description:** Rookie raises his weapon at a small figure charging him. It is a child, no older than ten, but with the same filed teeth and dead eyes as the adults. Rookie freezes. He sees a kid. The kid sees meat. The child lunges, driving a shiv into Rookie's throat.
- **Internal Conflict:** Rookie dies with a look of confusion on his face. He held onto his humanity for one second too long, and it killed him. Ria sees this. She screams, not in grief, but in rage. She shoots the child without hesitation.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Rookie (gurgling):** "I couldn't... he was just a kid..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "There are no kids here! Just targets!"

- **Key Event:** Ria takes a serious wound.
- **Detailed Description:** Distracted by Rookie's fall, Ria is flanked. The leader of the Cannibals, a massive man wearing armor made of street signs, swings a heavy pipe. It connects with Ria's side, crushing armor and bone. She goes down, gasping. She rolls, firing her pistol into the leader's stomach until he stops twitching.
- **Detailed Description:** The ambush breaks. The Cannibals retreat, dragging their dead (and Rookie's body) with them. They leave the survivors bleeding in the dark.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Cannibal Leader (dying):** "Fresh meat. Still walking. We'll be back for the rest."

### Scene 2: The Triage / The Safe Room

- **Key Event:** The group retreats to a reinforced pump room.
- **Detailed Description:** They retreat to the reinforced pump room, which has been converted into a forward command post. **General Ironwood** stands at the tactical table, testing the weight of his new, crudely welded cybernetic legs. They clang against the deck with every step. He looks at the retreating group.
- **Detailed Description:** **Medic Stitch** sets up a triage station on a workbench. Ria is pale, her breath coming in shallow rasps. The impact broke ribs and likely ruptured her spleen. She is bleeding internally.
- **Detailed Description:** In the corner, a civilian woman is weeping. Her child, a boy named Leo (no relation to Angelica's brother), was also injured in the scuffle—a deep laceration on his leg that has nicked an artery. He is pale and cold.
- **Key Event:** Stitch makes an assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** He checks his supplies. He has one coagulant stim left. One.
- **Key Event:** The Command.
- **Detailed Description:** Stitch freezes. Ironwood limps over, the servos in his new legs whining. He looks at the tactical map, then at the two patients. He doesn't hesitate.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Stitch. Report."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Medic Stitch:** "One stim. Two patients. The kid is critical. Ria is critical."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Save the soldier. That is an order."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You can't decide that! The boy is innocent!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Finality is my job, Ward. Innocence doesn't hold a rifle. We need the Vanguard. Stitch, inject her. Now."
- **Internal Conflict:** Stitch hates himself, but he obeys the chain of command. He chooses utility over morality. He chooses the soldier.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Medic Stitch:** "Sorry, kid. Orders."

### Scene 3: The Consequence / The Night

- **Key Event:** Stitch administers the stim to Ria.
- **Detailed Description:** He injects Ria. Her breathing stabilizes as the drug knits her internal wounds. The color returns to her cheeks. Across the room, the mother watches. She knows what just happened. She holds her son as he bleeds out. It is a slow, quiet death. The boy gets colder. The mother stops crying and starts humming a lullaby.
- **Detailed Description:** The sound of the lullaby fills the room, more accusing than any scream. Angelica sits in the corner, knees to her chest, listening to the boy die. She feels the weight of the leadership she claimed. This is the price.
- **Key Event:** Stitch drinks.
- **Detailed Description:** Stitch finds a bottle of industrial ethanol in his kit. He drinks it straight. He sits by the door, gun in one hand, bottle in the other, staring at the wall. He refuses to look at the mother.
- **Internal Conflict:** Stitch knows he will never sleep again without the bottle. He saved the body, but he killed the soul of the group.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Medic Stitch** — His guilt is absolute, but he knows he would make the same choice again. He is a pragmatist in hell.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (waking up):** "I didn't ask you to—"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Medic Stitch:** "Shut up. Just... survive. That's the payment. You owe that kid a life. Make it count."

### Scene 4: The March / The Morning

- **Key Event:** The group moves out.
- **Detailed Description:** They leave the body of the child wrapped in a blanket. They cannot bury him; the floor is steel. They leave him for the dark. The mother walks like a ghost, hollowed out. No one speaks. The silence is heavy, pressing down on them like the rock above.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica looks at her group. They are harder now. Colder. Rookie is dead because he hesitated. The child is dead because he wasn't useful. They are shedding their humanity to stay light enough to outrun death. She wonders what will be left of them when they reach the surface.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "We don't stop. Stopping gets you eaten. Keep moving."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We remember them. Rookie. Leo. We carry them with us."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Dead weight, Captain. But if it helps you walk, carry it."
