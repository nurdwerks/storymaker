## Chapter 14: The Years

### Scene 1: The Montage / The Scaffolding

- **Key Event:** Time blurs. It isn't measured in days, but in rivets.
- **Key Event:** **Year 1:** The keel is laid.
- **Key Event:** **Year 3:** The ribs loop up like the skeleton of a whale.
- **Key Event:** **Year 5:** The first hull plates are hammered into place. Constant, rhythmic clanging that echoes through the valley from dawn to dusk.
- **Key Event:** **Year 10:** The engines are mounted. Massive, distinct shapes that promise fire.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is always there. Pointing. Yelling. Drawing in the dirt.
- **Key Event:** She doesn't stop. She sleeps in short bursts. She eats while walking.
- **Key Event:** The seasons change. The jungle grows back, and they cut it down. The rains come, and they work in the mud. The sun burns, and they work in the heat.

### Scene 2: The Broken Brother / The Logging Camp

- **Key Event:** **Year 12.** A tragedy in the logging camp.
- **Key Event:** A massive redwood shifts on the rollers.
- **Key Event:** Bjorn the Breaker, Ragnar's blood-brother, is too slow.
- **Key Event:** The log crushes his legs.
- **Key Event:** He screams. The healers come running.
- **Key Event:** They drag him out. His legs are ruined using.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar stands over him.
- **Key Event:** "Brother," Bjorn gasps. "Help me up."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar looks at the mangled limbs. Then at the log that stopped moving.
- **Key Event:** "Move the log," Ragnar orders the men.
- **Key Event:** "But Bjorn..."
- **Key Event:** "Move the log!" Ragnar roars. "The ship needs wood!"
- **Key Event:** He looks down at Bjorn. There is no pity in his eyes. Only calculation.
- **Key Event:** "A wolf that cannot run drags down the pack," he says.
- **Key Event:** He turns his back.
- **Key Event:** Bjorn is left in the mud. He stops screaming. He just stares at his brother's back, realizing the world has changed.

### Scene 3: The Aging / The Upper Deck

- **Key Event:** **Year 18.**
- **Key Event:** Angelica sits on the edge of the finished upper deck, 100 feet in the air.
- **Key Event:** She looks at her hands. They are calloused, scarred. The hands of a worker, not a noble.
- **Key Event:** She touches her face. There are lines around her eyes. Gray in her hair.
- **Key Event:** She was twenty when she crashed. She is forty now.
- **Key Event:** Torin sits beside her. He is grayer too. Thicker.
- **Key Event:** He passes her a water skin.
- **Key Event:** "It is a good view," he says.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sighs. "I'm old, Torin. Look at me. I'm a hag."
- **Key Event:** Torin looks at her. Really looks at her.
- **Key Event:** "No," he says. "You look like the mountain. Strong. Weathered. Unmovable."
- **Key Event:** He touches a scar on her cheek.
- **Key Event:** "The smooth stone is pretty," he says. "But the rough stone holds the wall. You are the rough stone, Angelica."
- **Key Event:** Angelica leans into his touch. It is the only softness she allows herself.

### Scene 4: The Truth / The Upper Deck

- **Key Event:** The sun sets, turning the hull to gold.
- **Key Event:** "I missed it," Angelica whispers.
- **Key Event:** "What?"
- **Key Event:** "My life," she says. "I missed being young. I missed... everything."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the ship. Her masterpiece. Her prison.
- **Key Event:** "Time moves differently when you are building something eternal," she says. "I forgot to count the years, Torin. I woke up, and my youth was gone. I traded my life for a ship."
- **Key Event:** Torin stands up. He offers her a hand.
- **Key Event:** "You traded your life for _our_ lives," he says. "A fair trade."
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes his hand. She stands wincing at the ache in her back.
- **Key Event:** "Let's hope so," she says. "Because I can't get a refund."
