# Chapter 10: Sparring

The locker room smelled of fear and Tiger Balm.

It was 0600 hours, thirty minutes before the Sparring Session, and the air was already thick with tension. Fifty cadets from Squad Iron were cramming themselves into their gear, strapping on greaves and tightening bracers with the grim efficiency of soldiers preparing for a suicide mission.

The locker room didn't just smell like fear; it sounded like it. The squeak of rubber on tile. The sharp intake of breath. The murmur of prayers to the machine-gods mixed with the rhythmic thud of fists hitting palms. It was the soundtrack of anxiety, a symphony of nerves playing on a loop.

Angelica sat on a bench in the corner, carefully wrapping her hands.

She did it slowly, methodically. Over the thumb, across the wrist, between the fingers. The cloth was coarse, meant to protect the knuckles, but she knew it wouldn't matter. Against the reinforced exoskeletons of Squad Gold or the mutation-enhanced bone density of Squad Bronze, this tape was just a placebo.

"You're wrapping it too tight," Ria said.

Angelica looked up. Ria was sitting on the locker opposite her, swinging her legs. She wasn't wrapping her hands. She was polishing her steel bracers with a dirty rag.

"If I wrap it tight, I can't feel my fingers," Angelica muttered. "If I can't feel my fingers, I won't feel them break."

Ria laughed, but it was a brittle sound. "That's one strategy. I prefer the 'hit them until they stop moving' approach."

She hopped down and flexed her arms. The steel bracers glinted under the harsh fluorescent lights. They weren't standard issue. Ria had scavenged them from a decommissioned loader-bot in the junkyard and reshaped them to fit her forearms. Technically, they were contraband. Practically, they were the only reason she was still alive.

"Who do you think you'll get?" Ria asked, leaning against the lockers.

"Doesn't matter," Angelica said, pulling the tape tight with her teeth. "They're all bigger than me."

"Halloway might put you against Kila," Ria suggested. "She's fast, but she telegraphs her kicks."

"Kila is in the infirmary," Angelica corrected. "Broke her ankle yesterday trying to bond with a Shadow-Stalker."

"Right," Ria grimaced. "Nasty business. Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Maybe you'll get a Bronze. They're slow."

"They're not slow," Angelica said softly. "They're heavy. There's a difference."

She finished the wrap and flexed her hand. It felt like a club. A useless, padded club.

"Where's the bird?" Ria asked, looking at Angelica's empty shoulder.

"In the ring," Angelica said. "Scouting."

Ria raised an eyebrow. "Scouting? It's a sand pit, Angel. It's round. There's nothing to scout."

"He's analyzing the pylons," Angelica explained. "He thinks the electrostatic frequency is off. He says it tastes like 'orange static'."

"Orange static," Ria repeated. "Right. Remind me never to let your pet calibrate my gear."

The PA system crackled to life, interrupting them.

"Squad Iron," Instructor Krell's voice boomed, distorted by the cheap speakers. "Report to the Arena. You have five minutes to bleed."

Ria pushed off the locker. She grabbed her helmet from the hook.

"Showtime," she said, flashing a grin that was all teeth and adrenaline. "Try not to die, Angel. I still owe you five credits for lunch."

"I'll try," Angelica promised.

She stood up, grabbing her own helmet. It felt heavy in her hands. She followed Ria out of the locker room, into the long, concrete tunnel that led to the Arena.

The tunnel was dark, lit only by the red emergency strips on the floor. It sloped downward, leading them deeper into the earth, toward the smell of ozone and old blood.

---

The Arena smelled like ozone and old blood.

It was a circular pit, fifty meters in diameter, dug deep into the bedrock at the base of the Spire. The floor wasn't dirt; it was black volcanic sand imported from the ash-wastes of Sector 7. It absorbed sound, movement, and—most importantly—fluid.

Around the perimeter, electrostatic pylons hummed with a low, menacing buzz. They projected an invisible containment field that crackled every time a stray drop of sweat hit it. The air was heavy, humid, and tasted of recycled oxygen and fear.

Angelica stood in the center of the ring, her bare feet sinking into the warm grit. She wore standard-issue sparring greaves and hand wraps that felt too light, too flimsy against the monster standing across from her.

Above her, the observation decks were packed. The Academy's caste system was on full display.

At the very top, behind polarized glass and air-conditioned luxury, sat the Command Staff—Vane, Halloway, and the silent, terrifying specter of Lord Cromwell. They were the gods of this world, watching the ants fight for their amusement.

Below them, in the gold-plated box seats, sat Squad Gold. They looked bored. They sipped chilled nectar from crystal flutes, betting credits on how long the "Silt-Rat" would last. Lydia was there, her nose still bandaged from the cafeteria incident, glaring down with a mixture of hatred and anticipation.

Then came Squad Silver and Bronze, filling the middle tiers. They were the loudest, cheering for blood, screaming for violence. They were the mob.

And finally, segregated to the lowest level, standing pressed against the containment field behind a mesh screen, was Squad Iron. They were silent. They weren't cheering. They were studying. Because they knew that whatever happened to Angelica today would happen to them tomorrow.

"Entity Ward," Instructor Krell barked from the observation deck. "Entity Toro. Center."

Toro was a slab of granite carved into the shape of a boy. He was from the Foundry District, the industrial heart of the Zenith where the gravity plating was tuned 10% higher to build bone density. At sixteen, he was already six-four and weighed two hundred and forty pounds of labor-hardened muscle.

He rolled his neck. _Crack. Crack._

He grinned at Angelica. It wasn't a friendly grin. It was the look a hammer gives a nail.

"Hey, Silt-Rat," Toro whispered, his voice a low rumble that vibrated in Angelica's chest. "You look lost. Need directions to the garbage chute?"

Angelica didn't answer. She bounced on the balls of her feet, keeping her hands up. She felt small. In the Silt, speed was survival. You didn't fight the big things; you outran them. But in the ring, there was nowhere to run.

"Combat parameters: Unarmed," Krell announced, his voice amplified by the PA system. "Victory conditions: Knockout, submission, or ring-out. Begin."

But before they could move, Krell held up a hand.

"Pause," he barked.

The arena froze.

"Look at them," Krell said, his voice dropping to a conversational tone that was somehow louder than a shout. He gestured to the two combatants. "Biology. Meat. Bone. Fluid. Fragile things."

He paced the observation deck, a predator in a cage of glass.

"The Iron Selection is not about who is strongest," Krell lectured. "Strength is a variable. It fluctuates. It fades. The Selection is about who can _endure_. Who can take the data of pain and process it into a survival strategy."

He looked down at Angelica.

"You are small, Ward. You are weak. Physics dictates that you lose this engagement 99 times out of 100."

He looked at Toro.

"You are large, Toro. You are dense. Physics dictates that you win. But physics does not account for the Soul. It does not account for the Will. So show me. Show me if the math is right, or if one of you is an anomaly."

He dropped his hand.

"Resume."

Toro moved.

For a big man, he was terrifyingly fast. He launched himself forward, closing the distance in two strides. He threw a right hook that was less of a punch and more of a demolition event.

Angelica ducked. She felt the wind of the blow ruffle her hair. She pivoted, sliding to his blind side, and threw a jab at his ribs.

_Thud._

It was like hitting a concrete pylon wrapped in leather. The impact jarred her wrist, shooting a bolt of pain up to her shoulder. Toro didn't even flinch. He just laughed.

"That tickles," he grunted.

He spun around, faster than physics should allow, and backhanded her.

It wasn't a clean hit—just a glancing blow—but it lifted Angelica off her feet. She spun in the air and hit the sand hard, rolling to absorb the momentum. She tasted copper.

_Warning: Kinetic Impact detected,_ Aeon's voice whispered in her head. The gryphon was perched on the railing of the Iron section, watching with intense, unblinking eyes. _Analysis: Subject Mass exceeds defensive capabilities by 300%. Suggestion: Retreat._

"I can't retreat," Angelica thought back, scrambling to her feet. "It's a ring-out. Instant fail."

Toro charged again.

This time, Angelica didn't try to hit him. She tried to use his momentum. As he swung, she grabbed his wrist and dropped her weight, attempting a judo throw she had learned from a datapad.

She pulled.

Toro didn't move. He stood there, looking down at her like she was an annoying child hanging off his arm.

"Cute," he said.

He grabbed her collar with his free hand. He lifted her up—one-handed—until her feet dangled six inches off the sand.

"You don't belong here," he spat, his face inches from hers. "You're a glitch. A mistake. Go back to the gutter where the garbage lives."

He slammed her down.

The air left Angelica's lungs in a Whoosh. The black sand rushed up to meet her. The world went white for a second.

Then Toro dropped a knee onto her chest.

It was heavy—crushing weight that pinned her to the floor. She gasped, trying to pull in air, but her diaphragm was paralyzed.

"Stay down," Toro whispered.

"Point, Toro!" Krell shouted. "Reset! Get up, Ward. Pain is data. Assimilate it and improve. You are bleeding? Good. That means you are still useful."

Toro stood up, wiping his hands on his pants. He looked at the crowd—mostly the Bronze and Iron sections—and raised his fists in victory. They cheered. Not because they liked him, but because they liked violence.

Angelica rolled onto her side, coughing. She spat a mouthful of bloody saliva into the sand.

_Subject Status: Compromised,_ Aeon noted. _Structural integrity: 98%. Pride: 0%._

"Shut up," Angelica wheezed.

She stood up. Her ribs ached. Her lip was split. She looked at Toro, who was already turning away, dismissing her as a threat.

She hated him. But more than that, she hated that he was right. She didn't know how to fight like this. She knew how to survive, not how to win.

"Next pair!" Krell yelled. "Entity Stone. Entity Toro. Center."

Ria stepped over the barrier.

She dropped five feet from the stands to the sand, landing in a crouch. She stood up slowly. She wasn't wearing standard greaves. She was wearing heavy, unauthorized steel bracers on her forearms.

She cracked her knuckles. _Pop. Pop. Pop._

She looked at Angelica, then at Toro. Her eyes were dark, devoid of their usual manic humor.

"You broke her lip," Ria said. It wasn't a question.

Toro sneered. "She tripped. Clumsy little rat."

Ria walked to the center of the ring. She stood there, loose, relaxed, her arms hanging by her sides.

"Combat parameters," Krell started.

"Skip it," Ria interrupted. "Let's go."

Toro grinned. He saw another Iron grunt. Another punching bag.

He charged.

He threw the same right hook—the demolition punch. He put his hips into it, aiming for Ria's jaw.

Ria didn't dodge. She didn't block. She didn't weave.

She stepped _into_ it.

She took the punch directly on her forehead.

_CLANG._

The sound echoed through the arena. It didn't sound like flesh hitting flesh. It sounded like a hammer hitting an anvil.

Toro gasped, pulling his hand back. He looked at his knuckles. They were bruised, the skin split.

Ria's head had snapped back, but now she slowly turned it forward.

The transformation was visceral. It started at her neck, a wave of quicksilver that raced up her skin. Her pores vanished. Her eyelashes stiffened into needles. Her eyes, usually dark and warm, turned into spheres of polished chrome.

The air around her grew cold as the heat was sucked out of the atmosphere to fuel the bond. The smell of ozone spiked, sharp and metallic.

"My turn," Ria whispered. Her voice wasn't human anymore. It sounded like grinding gears.

She reached out—fast, blurringly fast—and grabbed Toro's injured hand. Her grip was hydraulic. Her fingers dug into his muscle like steel clamps, bruising the flesh instantly.

Toro screamed. "Let go!"

"Weak bones," Ria noted, tilting her head. The movement was jerky, robotic. "Calcium structure: insufficient. Density: laughable. You should drink more milk. Or maybe melted steel."

She twisted.

There was a wet, sickening _SNAP_ as Toro's radius broke cleanly in two.

He dropped to his knees, wailing, clutching his ruined arm. The arena went silent. Even Krell looked impressed.

Ria let go. She stood over the weeping giant, her skin slowly fading back to normal olive tones. She looked up at the observation deck, then over at Angelica.

She winked.

"Winner: Entity Stone," Krell announced, his voice devoid of sympathy. "Medical team to the sand. Next pair!"

---

A medical drone hovered into the arena. It was an old model, a floating sphere of white plastic with retractable manipulator arms. It buzzed over to where Toro lay in the black sand, clutching his arm.

Angelica watched from the sidelines, nursing her split lip. She should have looked away. She should have enjoyed the sight of the bully reduced to a weeping child.

But then the drone stalled.

It emitted a high-pitched whine. Its manipulator arm, holding the laser-sealer, twitched spasmodically. Sparks showered from its chassis, landing on Toro's exposed skin.

"Do something!" Toro screamed, kicking at the drone. "It's burning me!"

The drone didn't respond. It was stuck in a logic loop, its single red eye blinking rapidly.

_Glitch,_ Aeon whispered in Angelica's mind. _Servo-motor seize in the primary joint. It cannot deploy the healing field._

Angelica looked around. Krell was busy shouting at the next pair of cadets. The other students were laughing or ignoring the scene. No one was moving to help.

She sighed.

"Curse my life," she muttered.

She hopped over the barrier and ran onto the sand.

"Get away from me, Silt-Rat!" Toro yelled as she approached. "Haven't you done enough?"

"Shut up," Angelica snapped. She wasn't looking at him. she was looking at the drone. "hold still or I'll let it cauterize your nose instead of your arm."

She reached out and grabbed the drone's chassis. It was hot to the touch. She didn't have her tools, but she didn't need them. She _felt_ the mechanism. She felt the stuck gear, the corrupted code streaming through its processor.

She jammed her thumb into a hidden release panel on the underside of the sphere. She twisted her wrist, forcing the seized joint back into alignment.

_Click._

The whining stopped. The red eye turned green.

"Diagnostic complete," the drone chirped in a pleasant, synthetic voice. "Deploying tissue regeneration field."

A blue light washed over Toro's arm. The screaming stopped instantly as the pain receptors were dampened.

Angelica stepped back, wiping grease on her pants.

Toro looked at his arm, then at her. His eyes were wide, confused. He opened his mouth to say something—maybe 'thank you,' maybe 'why?'—but his pride won out.

"I didn't ask for your help," he grunted, looking away.

"I didn't do it for you," Angelica said, turning to walk back to the barrier. 'I did it for the machine. It hates being broken."

---

Later, in the locker room, Ria explained it while the medical drone finished its work in the background.

"It's called the Numbness Sacrifice," Ria said, wrapping fresh tape around her hands. "To channel the Steel-Hide, you have to mentally deaden your nerves. You have to convince your brain that you are an object."

She tapped her chest.

"I gave up feeling soft things so I wouldn't feel the hard things," she said quietly. "Silk, water, a lover's touch... it all feels like concrete now. But so does a fist. That's the trade. That's the price. You want to be unbreakable? You have to stop feeling the break."

She looked at Angelica, her dark eyes serious.

"What's your price, Angel? What did you give up for that bird?"

Angelica touched the spot on her shoulder where Aeon usually sat. "I don't know yet," she whispered. "But I think... I think I gave up being invisible."

"Dangerous trade," Ria murmured.

She stood up. "I'm gonna hit the showers. Watch your back, Angel. Toro has friends. And they look pissed."

Ria disappeared into the steam.

Angelica stayed by her locker, looking at her bruised face in the polished metal mirror. She looked tired. She looked small.

She didn't see the three shadows detach themselves from the wall behind her until it was too late.

The locker room was a maze of steam and steel. It was damp, smelling of industrial soap and the copper tang of blood being washed down drains. The air was thick, obscuring vision and muffling sound. It was the perfect place for an accident.

"You think your bodyguard makes you safe?" a voice growled from the mist.

Angelica spun around, water dripping from her hair.

Three boys stood between her and the exit. They wore the grey fatigues of Squad Bronze, but their accent was pure Foundry—thick, guttural, and angry. Toro's friends.

"She's not here now," the leader said. He was shorter than Toro but wider, with a neck that seemed to merge directly into his shoulders. He held a heavy towel in his hands, twisting it tight like a garrote. "It's just us."

Angelica backed up until her shoulders hit the cold tile wall. She looked for a weapon. A bench. A mop. Anything. But the space was empty.

"Toro put a lot of work into that arm," the leader continued, stepping closer. "He needs it to lift crates. Now he's going to be out of rotation for weeks. That costs him credits. That costs _us_ credits."

"I didn't break it," Angelica said, her voice steady despite the hammering of her heart. "Ria did."

"Same squad. Same difference," the second boy spat. "Resonants don't take orders from mechanics. You need to learn your place, Silt-Rat. Your place is on the floor."

They moved in a pack, closing the semi-circle. They weren't moving fast. They wanted her to feel it. They wanted to savor the fear.

And for a moment, she did feel it.

It was the old fear. The Silt fear. The feeling of being small in a world of giants. The feeling of hiding in a rusted vent while the gangs roamed the tunnels below. It was a cold, paralyzing weight in her gut.

_Threat Assessment: Critical,_ Aeon's voice whispered. But it wasn't coming from her shoulder. Aeon was back in the dorms, recharging. The voice was coming from... inside. _Hostile entities. Escape probability: 12%._

"Grab her," the leader ordered.

The third boy lunged.

Angelica reacted on instinct. She ducked, but not fast enough. He caught her arm, his fingers digging into her bicep. He slammed her back against the lockers.

_BANG._

The sound of metal hitting metal rang out.

"Hold her still," the leader said, wrapping the towel around his fist. "Let's see if she breaks as easy as her lip."

Angelica struggled, kicking out, but the second boy grabbed her legs. She was pinned. Trapped. Helpless.

And then, the fear changed.

It happened in a heartbeat. The cold weight in her gut didn't disappear; it compressed. It imploded. It collapsed into a singularity of white-hot indignation.

She thought of Halloway calling her a scavenger. She thought of Toro's knee on her chest. She thought of the years of hiding, of scavenging, of being told she was _nothing_.

The memories didn't play like a movie; they hit her like physical blows.

She remembered being six years old, curling her small body into the wheel well of a rusted transport carrier. It was winter in the Silt, and the metal was so cold it burned her skin. Outside, a Scav-Gang was dismantling her shelter—a collection of corrugated tin sheets she had spent months assembling. She could hear their laughter, the shrieking of pry-bars tearing metal, the heavy thud of boots kicking through her meager possessions. She had covered her mouth with both hands to keep from sobbing, knowing that if they found her, they would take her too.

She remembered being ten. She had found a pristine intake valve in a pile of medical waste—a piece of "Pre-War" tech worth a month of rations. She had taken it to Old Man Silas, the fence who operated out of a hollowed-out drainage pipe. He had looked at the valve, his eyes gleaming with greed, and then looked at her. He hadn't paid her. He had kicked dirt in her face, laughed, and told her that rats didn't own property. She had walked home with empty pockets and a bruised pride that hurt more than the hunger.

And she remembered today. The cafeteria. The classroom. The Arena. The way they looked at her—not with hatred, but with disgust. As if she were a glitch in their perfect code. An error that needed to be deleted.

They didn't hate her because she was dangerous. They hated her because she was _inconvenient_. She was a stain on their perfect, ordered world.

And now, they wanted to wipe her away.

_No._

The word started in her chest, a small, stubborn ember.

_I survived the rust. I survived the hunger. I survived the cold._

She looked at the leader's sneering face. She saw the pores on his nose, the broken capillaries in his eyes. He wasn't a giant. He was just a boy with a towel and a cruel streak.

_I am not a victim._

The ember flared. It consumed the fear. It burned away the paralysis.

_I am an heir to the Interface. I am a survivor of the void._

_No,_ she thought.

The word echoed in her mind, loud as a thunderclap.

_I am not nothing. I am an heir to the Interface. I am a survivor of the void._

The violet light didn't come from a flashlight. It came from her eyes.

"Get off me!" she screamed.

It wasn't a scream of panic. It was a command.

She pushed.

<!-- CONT -->

The air in front of her didn't just move; it folded.

It happened in slow motion. Time, which had been so cruel to her in the ring, suddenly became her ally. She saw the dust motes in the air freeze. She saw the droplets of condensation on the lockers hang suspended in the mist.

A shockwave of violet energy erupted from her center of mass. It wasn't fire. It wasn't electricity. It was pure, distilled _No_.

It was "Level 5 Kinetic Displacement," though she wouldn't know the term until later. To her, it felt like the entire universe suddenly decided that the three boys were standing in the wrong place.

_BOOM._

The sound wasn't a noise; it was a physical impact. It hit the room like a sledgehammer hitting a bell.

The tiles on the walls didn't just crack; they disintegrated, turning into a cloud of ceramic shrapnel moving at subsonic speeds. The steam, which had been a thick fog a millisecond ago, was instantly vaporized, leaving a clear, perfectly circular hole in the atmosphere where the pressure wave had passed.

The boy holding her arm didn't just let go. He was launched.

He flew backward as if hit by a freight train. He smashed into the boy behind him, and together they tumbled through the air, flailing like ragdolls. They hit the far wall—twenty feet away—with a bone-crunching impact that dented the heavy steel doors of the lockers.

The leader, the one with the towel, was lifted off his feet. He spun in the air, crashing into a bench and sliding across the wet floor until he hit the sinks.

Then physics reasserted itself.

Gravity returned. The boys slid to the floor, groaning, unmoving.

Angelica stood there, panting. Her hands were trembling. Her skin felt hot, like she had been sunburned from the inside out.

She looked at the devastation. The shattered tiles. The dented steel. The unconscious boys.

"Physics," she whispered, her voice shaking, "is just a suggestion when you have enough energy."

She took a step, and her knees buckled.

It wasn't fear this time. It was exhaustion. The energy she had released hadn't come from a battery; it had come from her own bio-electric reserves. She felt hollowed out, scraped clean. Her muscles trembled with a fine, uncontrollable vibration.

She grabbed the edge of a sink to hold herself up. The metal crumpled under her grip like tin foil.

"Whoa," she breathed, staring at the warped steel. "Okay. Easy."

She looked at her hands. They were glowing. Not brightly—just a faint, violet luminescence beneath the skin, tracing the lines of her veins. It faded as she watched, the light retreating back into her marrow.

She stepped over the leader's legs. He groaned, a wet, gurgling sound. He would live. He would have a concussion and a bruised ego, but he would live.

She didn't look back. She walked out of the locker room, leaving the steam to curl back into the void she had created.

---

The walk back to the dorms was a blur.

Angelica kept her head down, avoiding the gaze of passing cadets. She felt like she was vibrating at a frequency that was slightly out of sync with reality. The floor felt too soft; the air felt too thick.

She made it to her room—Section 4, Bunk 12—and collapsed onto her mattress. The room was empty. Ria was still in the showers (or maybe celebrating her victory in the mess hall).

_Status Report,_ a voice staticked in her mind.

Angelica jumped. She looked at the desk. Aeon was there, powered down, his head tucked under his wing. But he was awake.

_I felt a surge,_ Aeon continued. _Local Chronal Disturbance. Magnitude 5. Did you detonate a thermal charge?_

Angelica rolled onto her back, staring at the rusty ceiling fan. "No," she whispered. "I pushed them."

_Clarification: You applied kinetic force?_

"I applied... everything."

She held up her hand. It was still shaking.

"I didn't mean to hurt them, Aeon. I just wanted them to stop. And then... the anger... it just exploded."

Aeon lifted his head. His blue eyes whirred as they focused on her.

_Emotion is fuel,_ he stated simply. _You are an Engine, Mechanic. You have simply found your throttle._

"I'm not an engine," Angelica argued, though she felt less sure than she sounded. "I'm a girl. And I think I just put a target on my back."

_Targets are relevant,_ Aeon countered. _Targets imply value. Yesterday, you were refuse. Today, you are a threat. This is an upgrade._

Angelica closed her eyes. An upgrade. Was that what it was? To be feared?

She remembered the look on the leader's face as he flew through the air. It hadn't been fear. It had been shock. He hadn't believed that the Silt-Rat could bite back.

"They'll come for me," she whispered. "Toro. His friends. Halloway."

_Let them comes,_ Aeon said, his feathers ruffling with a metallic clink. _We are hungry._

High above, in the darkened Observation Deck, Prelate Vane watched the security feed.

The room was a shrine to silence. The walls were lined with black acoustical foam, absorbing every sound from the Academy below. The only light came from the central holotable, which cast a ghostly blue pallor over Vane's sharp features.

He rewound the footage. He watched the explosion again. And again.

"There it is," he whispered. "Kinetic Displacement. Level 5. Raw, unrefined, and beautiful."

He traced the violet distortion on the screen with a gloved finger.

"She isn't broken," Vane murmured. "She is a weapon waiting for a trigger. And I have found it."

He tapped a key on his console. "Dr. Aris. Report to the Observation Deck. Bring the raw telemetry from the locker room sensors."

"I am already uploading it, Prelate," Aris's voice replied, dry and metallic.

A moment later, the door hissed open. Dr. Aris entered. He was a man who had replaced so much of himself with machinery that it was hard to tell where the flesh ended and the chrome began. His left eye was a multi-spectrum sensor cluster; his right arm was a skeletal manipulator tipped with data-spikes.

He plugged his arm into the holotable.

"Processing," Aris said.

The hologram changed. The grainy security footage was replaced by a 3D wireframe of the locker room. Mathematical vectors appeared, plotting the trajectory of the blast.

"The energy signature is anomalous," Aris noted, his sensor-eye whirring as it focused on the display. "Standard kinetic displacement relies on the emotional resonance of the pilot amplifying the biological mass of the bonded beast. It is a closed loop. Pilot feels fear; Beast reacts; Pilot directs."

He pointed to the wireframe of Angelica.

"But here? The loop is open. The beast was not present. The energy did not come from the gryphon. It came from _her_."

Aris typed a command. A graph appeared, showing a spike of energy that went off the scale.

"She acted as a capacitor," Aris explained. "She stored the Chronal Potential of the beast—likely absorbed during their bond—and released it as a kinetic shockwave. It is... inefficient. Dangerous."

"Dangerous?" Vane asked, leaning forward.

"Catastrophic," Aris corrected. "Look at the decay rate."

He zoomed in on the wireframe of the wall. The dented steel wasn't just bent; it was aged. The metal was pitted with rust that hadn't been there a second before.

"She didn't just push the air," Aris whispered. "She accelerated the entropy of the local space-time manifold. She stole the future of that locker room to power her present anger."

Vane smiled. It was a cold, predatory smile. "She eats time. Just like the bird."

"If she does this again," Aris warned, "without a stabilizer, she risks a Resonance Cascade."

"Show me," Vane ordered.

Aris hesitated. "Prelate, the simulation is theoretical. It assumes a linear escalation of—"

"Show me, Doctor."

Aris sighed. He keyed in the parameters.

The hologram changed again. It showed the Spire. A red dot appeared in the barracks—Angelica. The dot expanded. It became a sphere of violet light. It grew larger, consuming the dorms, then the training halls, then the structural supports of the tower itself.

Within three seconds of the simulation, the Spire collapsed.

"Total structural failure," Aris narrated. "The entropy field would age the support beams to dust in milliseconds. The Spire would fall. Fifty thousand dead. The barrier would fail. The Void would consume the city."

The simulation ended. The hologram showed the Spire reduced to a pile of ash.

Vane stared at the ruin. He didn't look horrified. He looked entranced.

"The Great Filter," he whispered.

"Excuse me?" Aris asked.

Vane walked around the table, his eyes never leaving the image of the fallen tower.

"The ancients spoke of a Great Filter," Vane said softly. "A point in every civilization's history where they discover a power so great that it either elevates them to godhood or destroys them completely. The Artificers found it. They built the Chrono-Gryphons. And they failed the test. They were destroyed."

He looked at Aris.

"We have been stagnant for two centuries, Doctor. We hide behind our walls. We scavenge the bones of the past. We are dying, slowly, of safety."

He pointed at the red dot in the simulation.

"This girl... she is our second chance. She is the Filter. If she breaks, she destroys us. But if she holds..."

"If she holds?" Aris asked.

"Then she becomes the key to the Engine," Vane said. "She becomes the source of infinite energy. We won't need the barrier anymore. We won't need to hide."

"It is madness," Aris said. "The risk is 99%."

"There is no progress without risk," Vane countered. "Tear up the expulsion papers, Doctor. Ward is not to be touched. She is to be... stressed."

"Stressed?"

"Pressure creates diamonds," Vane said. "And it also triggers bombs. I want to know which one she is."

He turned back to the screen, to the image of the girl with the glowing hands.

"Increase the difficulty of her simulation modules," Vane ordered. "Put her in the Crucible. Isolate her from her support network. Let's see how much pressure the vessel can take before it cracks."

Aris pulled his arm from the console. "As you command, Prelate. But when the sky falls... do not say I didn't warn you."

"When the sky falls," Vane said, turning to look at the empty throne at the back of the room, "I will be the one catching it."

The Emperor was watching. And now, the Emperor would have something worth seeing.
