## Chapter 6: The Iron Mask

### Scene 1: The Broadcast

- **Key Event:** Public Screens, Sector 4.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands in the shadows of a crowded marketplace in District 4. Above the heads of the throng, giant holographic screens flicker to life. The face of Lady Corinne appears. She is dressed in the mournful white of a betrayed aristocrat. Her eyes are red-rimmed, her voice trembling with perfected emotion. She denounces Angelica Ward.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne (on screen):** "She was my friend. I trusted her with my life. But she betrayed us all. She is a traitor who betrayed everything we worked for. She is dangerous. I beg anyone who sees her... report her immediately. For the safety of the Zenith."

- **Key Event:** The public reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** The crowd mutters angrily. They see a monster. Angelica watches, her face hidden by a hood. She knows the truth. This is a performance. Corinne is playing the role of the loyal subject to survive Vane's purge.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Publicly plays the role of loyal aristocrat while privately working to save her friend. It is a masterful lie.

### Scene 2: The Bar

- **Key Event:** The Rusty Gear.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr grabs Angelica's arm and pulls her into a side alley. "Show's over, Princess. Let's move." He leads her down a set of rusting stairs into the bowels of the Mid-Sects. They arrive at "The Rusty Gear," a hidden bar for the desperate. The air is thick with hallucinogenic smoke and the smell of cheap synthetic gin. It is a place for hackers, smugglers, and people who don't want to be found.

- **Key Event:** The atmosphere.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica keeps her head down. She is exhausted, her side bleeding from a graze during the escape. She scans the room. It is filled with rough characters—cyborgs with illegal mods, deserters from the Iron Legion.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She remains vigilant and hides her identity even while physically exhausted and injured. She does not lean on Zephyr. She stands on her own.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Welcome to the gutter. Everyone here would sell their mother for a battery pack. You're worth a thousand mothers, so keep your hood up."

### Scene 3: The Musician

- **Key Event:** The recognition.
- **Detailed Description:** A saxophone plays a mournful, bluesy tune in the corner. The player is an old man with a greying beard and sad eyes—Hatcher. He stops playing mid-note as Angelica walks past. He stares at her. The silence spreads through the bar like a contagion. Patrons turn to look. Hatcher recognizes her not from the bounty headers, but from the past.

- **Key Event:** The intervention.
- **Detailed Description:** Before anyone can draw a weapon or a comm-link, Hatcher slams his saxophone onto the bar. "Closing time!" he roars. He vaults the bar, grabs Angelica and Zephyr, and shoves them towards a heavy steel door in the back. "Move! Before the vultures realize who you are."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He immediately prioritizes security and ushers them into a private back room to avoid a confrontation. He is not just a musician; he moves like a cop.

### Scene 4: The Message

- **Key Event:** The back room.
- **Detailed Description:** The back room is a cluttered office filled with old surveillance gear and physical paper files. Lisbet, a young tech-goth girl with neon hair, is there, monitoring a bank of screens. She intercepts an encrypted transmission. It’s on a private frequency used by House Aurum.

- **Key Event:** The decode.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet cracks the encryption. It is a message from Corinne. It contains a map of Warden patrol routes and "safe windows" for movement in the lower sectors. Corinne didn't just denounce Angelica; she used the broadcast time to mask a data burst.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Her loyalty to Angelica outweighs her public performance; she risks everything to help from the shadows.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne (encrypted text):** "Patrol gap at 0300. East corridor clear for 7 minutes. Don't die, you idiot. I can't look unexpected in black."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Corinne. She's still in my corner. Even now. She lied to the world to tell me the truth."

### Scene 5: The Backstory

- **Key Event:** The revelation.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher pours three glasses of amber liquid. He looks at Angelica. "You look just like her," he says. He reveals he was a Zenith Police detective twenty years ago. He investigated the 'accident' that killed Angelica's parents. It wasn't an accident. It was a hit ordered by Vane.

- **Key Event:** The motive.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher explains that he found evidence, but Vane buried it and blacklisted him. He lost his badge, his pension, and his life. He has been hiding in the Silt ever since.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He shows a weary bitterness towards the system that ruined him for seeking justice.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Vane doesn't leave loose ends. He ties them into nooses. I've been waiting to see if you'd survive long enough to find me."

### Scene 6: The Heritage

- **Key Event:** The heavy truth.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher drops the final bombshell. Angelica's mother wasn't just a scientist. She was the First Navigator of the original Generation Ship from Earth. She held the "Key codes" to the ship's core systems—codes that are now locked in Angelica's DNA. That is why Vane wants her. She is the legitimate heir to the Interface Throne. She is the only one who can fully control the Zenith.

- **Key Event:** The resolve.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stares at her reflection in the dirty mirror. She sees the brand behind her ear, but now she sees something else. A crown.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She learns the truth of her heritage and the reason for the Throne's resonance. She forms a resolve to find the Cylinder of Truth and stop Vane. She is no longer running; she is advancing.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "I don't solve crimes anymore, kid. I just drink until I forget who committed them."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's time to sober up, Hatcher. We have a government to overthrow."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** (Smiling grimly) "Maybe it's time I remembered."
