# Chapter 1: The Scavenger's Prince

The air in Sector 12 tasted of copper and old regrets. It was a flavor Angelica Ward had known since she was old enough to breathe without coughing up black phlegm, a metallic tang that coated the back of the throat and refused to wash away. It was the taste of the Silt, the sprawling, subterranean graveyard of technology that festered beneath the gleaming, sun-drenched spires of the Zenith.

Angelica shifted her weight, the leather of her harness creaking against the damp rust of the suspension cable. She was dangling four hundred feet above the ground, suspended in the tangled web of infrastructure that made up Node 42. Below her, the "River"—a massive, churning conveyor belt of refuse—roared like a dying beast, a ceaseless, grinding avalanche of shattered plastic, twisted metal, and chemical sludge flowing from the upper city down to the molecular shredders.

She adjusted her goggles, the modified welding lenses sliding over her eyes with a satisfying click. The world turned a sharp, high-contrast green, the thermal overlay highlighting the heat signatures of the friction-heated rollers far below.

"Come on," she whispered, her voice swallowed by the industrial din. "Give me something good today."

She was seventeen, though the Silt aged everything faster. Her hands, wrapped in duct-taped fingerless gloves, were stained with grease that no amount of scrubbing could remove. Her flight jacket, a scavenged relic from a pilot who had probably died of old age before she was born, was a patchwork of repairs—leather stitched with copper wire, reinforced with strips of blast-cloth. She was a creature of the Undercity, built from scraps and refuse, just like the world around her.

The wind down here was artificial, a draft created by the massive intake fans that cycled air from the surface, stripped it of oxygen, and pumped the waste heat down into the dark. It whipped her hair, a chaotic mop of dark curls, across her face. She blew a strand out of her eyes and checked her wrist-comp. The display was cracked, but the numbers were legible.

08:14:00.

The "Morning Drop."

Every day at 08:14, the waste chutes from Sector 1—the residential district of the elite—purged their bins. To the people up there, it was trash day. To Angelica, it was Christmas, birthday, and lottery all rolled into one.

Above her, the great pneumatic tube hissed. It was a sound like a giant inhaling, a build-up of pressure that vibrated through the metal lattice she clung to. The vibration traveled up her arms, settling in her teeth. She bent her knees, pressing her heavy magnetic boots against the rusted stanchion, coiling her muscles.

_Please don't be bio-waste,_ she prayed silently. _Please don't be diapers. Please don't be slop._

A week ago, the chute had dumped three tons of expired nutrient paste. The entire sector had smelled like rotting strawberries for days, and the cleanup had taken her weeks to scrape off her boots. She needed hard tech. She needed circuits. She needed something she could sell, or trade, or fix.

The hiss turned into a roar. The blast door at the end of the tube, fifty feet above her output, slammed open.

The garbage came.

It wasn't a stream; it was a shotgun blast. A chaotic cloud of debris exploded into the open air of the shaft, plummeting towards the conveyor belt far below. Angelica’s eyes darted behind the goggles, scanning the falling shapes.

Debris. Wrapper. Box. Broken furniture. Shattered glass.

_Trash. Trash. Trash._

Then, she saw it.

It tumbled end over end, flashing white against the grime. A cylinder. Not a food container—those were soft, biodegradable polymers. This was hard shell. Ceramic. White.

"Blue bin," she hissed. Medical tech.

It was falling wide, drifting away from the main cluster of trash, caught in an updraft from the vents. It was going to miss the belt. It was going to hit the shredder intakes on the side walls.

Angelica didn't think. Calculation was for the ground. Up here, survival was instinct.

She kicked off the stanchion.

For a heartbeat, she was flying. The cable on her harness played out, the auto-winch screaming in protest as she swung out over the abyss. The air rushed past her, smelling of ozone and rot. She extended her arms, her body a rigid line against the chaotic tumble of the fall.

The white cylinder was spinning fast. She had one shot.

She reached out, her gloves grappling for purchase. Her fingers brushed the smooth ceramic surface—slippery, polished, alien. She scrambled for a grip, her nails digging into a seam.

_Gotcha._

She curled around it, clutching the object to her chest like a football. The momentum of her swing carried her to the apex of the arc. She hung there for a split second, weightless, looking down at the churning death of the River below.

Then gravity called in the debt.

She swung back, gathering speed. The stanchion rushed towards her. She twisted her body, absorbing the impact with her legs. Her magnetic boots slammed onto the metal with a _clang_ that rang like a bell. The magnets engaged, locking her in place. The winch groaned, arresting her momentum.

She gasped, the air rushing back into her lungs. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic rhythm that matched the throbbing of the machinery around her. She looked down at her prize.

It wasn't a canister. It was a drone.

A Medical Drone, Model 7-Alpha. It was roughly the size of a cat, shaped like an elongated egg with rotor housings tucked into the chassis. It was sleek, sterile, and painfully beautiful. The white casing was marred by a blackened scorch mark on the side, and one of the stabilizer fins was bent at a sickening angle.

"Hello, beautiful," Angelica murmured, running a gloved thumb over the smooth curve of its hull.

She brought it closer to her face, flipping up her goggles. Her dark eyes scanned the damage. The chassis was cracked near the logic core housing. A clean break, likely from impact. But the core itself...

She pulled a multi-tool from her belt, flicking out a small spudger. She pried open the service panel.

The lights inside were dark. No hum of power. No blinking LEDs. Dead.

"Did they fry you?" she asked the machine softly. "Or did you just fall asleep?"

She sniffed the port. No smell of burnt ozone. The capacitors hadn't blown. It looked like a kinetic failure. Someone had dropped it, cracked the shell, and rather than run a ten-minute diagnostic, they had walked it to the chute and flushed it.

Typical. To the Zenith, a scratch was a death sentence. To them, perfection was the baseline, and anything less was refuse.

To Angelica, it was opportunity.

She secured the drone to her belt, wrapping a bungee cord around it for good measure. "You're coming home with me," she whispered. "Don't worry. I've got a workshop that'll make you feel right as rain. Well, right as acid rain, but it’s home."

She looked up. Another load was coming. She could hear the hiss.

She didn't push her luck. One miracle a day was the limit.

Angelica disengaged her magnets and began the climb.

---

The extraction was the easy part. The commute was the war.

Sector 12 wasn't just a place; it was an organism. It breathed, it ate, and it had antibodies. The antibodies were the Rust-Eaters, gangs of scavengers who lacked the finesse for structural engineering and preferred the blunt-force economics of mugging.

Angelica moved through the shadows of "The Warrens," the labyrinth of maintenance tunnels and pipe-ways that connected the major nodes. The drone was a heavy lump against her hip, a forty-pound target painted on her back. If anyone saw it—if anyone even suspected what she had—she’d be gutted before she could draw her knife.

She stuck to the high roads. The ventilation ducts were cramped, barely wide enough for her shoulders, but they were safe. She crawled on her elbows and knees, the metal grating biting into her skin through her clothes. The drone bumped against the floor with every movement, a metallic _thunk-thunk-thunk_ that sounded like a drumbeat in the confined space.

"Quiet," she hissed at it, as if it could help it.

She paused at a junction, peering through the slats of a vent cover. Below, in a wider corridor, a group of three men were stripping copper wire from a junction box. They were big, muscle-heavy from synth-steroids, their skin gray from lack of sun and too much silver-colloid water. Rust-Eaters.

One of them paused, tilting his head. "Hear that?"

Angelica froze. She held her breath, her heart doing that frantic hammering thing again.

"Hear what?" the second one grunted, ripping a bundle of cables free. Sparks showered down.

"Thumping. Like... metal on metal."

Angelica pressed herself flat against the duct floor. She closed her eyes, willing her heart to slow down, willing the drone to become lighter, softer.

"Pipe rats," the third man spat. "Ignore it. Get the copper. We gotta be at the smelter by nine."

They went back to work. Angelica waited for a full five minutes after they left before she dared to move again.

By the time she reached her sector, her knees were bruised and her arms were burning with lactic acid. She dropped down from a ceiling hatch into a narrow alleyway behind the old hydration plant. She landed in a crouch, scanning instantly. Clear.

She hurried towards the massive intake fan that dominated the end of the alley. It was a relic, a fifty-foot behemoth of rusted steel that had stopped spinning fifty years ago when the primary bearings fused. Now, it was just a wall.

Or so people thought.

Angelica slipped behind one of the massive blades, finding the hidden seam in the casing. She pressed her palm against a hidden reader she’d rigged up from a stolen door lock.

_Beep._

A section of the fan housing, indistinguishable from the rest, popped open with a hiss of hydraulics. She slipped inside, pulling the door shut behind her.

The locks engaged. The noise of the city—the grinding, the shouting, the constant hum of machinery—cut out instantly, replaced by the soft, steady whir of her own scrubbers.

Home.

It wasn't much. A converted maintenance crawlspace, maybe twenty feet by twenty. The walls were lined with pegboards overflowing with tools—wrenches, soldering irons, spools of wire, jars of screws sorted by thread count. The ceiling was low, forcing her to stoop slightly. Cables hung like vines, glowing with the soft blue light of stolen electricity she sapped from the main grid running through the wall.

In the corner, a small partition of heavy plastic sheeting created a "clean room."

Angelica didn't look at the plastic curtain yet. She couldn't. Not until she had good news.

She went to her workbench—a slab of metal scavenged from a bulkhead door, resting on two oil drums. She unhooked the drone and set it down gently.

"Alright," she said, exhaling a long breath she felt like she'd been holding for an hour. "Let's see what makes you tick."

She stripped off her jacket, revealing a tank top stained with oil and sweat. Her arms were lean, corded with the kind of muscle you got from lifting heavy things and holding on for dear life. She pulled on her "spectacles"—a terrifying contraption of lenses, wires, and a microprocessor strapped to a headband.

She flicked a switch on the side. The lenses magnified the drone's chassis. She could see the micro-fractures in the ceramic, the dust motes settled in the seams.

"Power's out," she muttered to herself, her voice shifting into the rhythmic cadence of work. "Hard reset didn't take. Core breach? No, shell's intact."

She picked up a probe, sliding it into a diagnostic port. The multimeter on her bench stayed flat.

"Dead short," she diagnosed. "The fall jars the connection to the battery. Safety cutoff engaged."

It was a safety feature. If a medical drone sensed catastrophic impact, it cut all power to prevent the lithium-ion cells from exploding. Smart. Annoying, but smart.

"I need to bypass the safety," she murmured. "But if I do that and the battery _is_ damaged..."

_Boom._

She bit her lip. She looked at the plastic sheeting in the corner.

She didn't have a choice.

"Don't blow up," she told the drone sternly. "I mean it. If you blow up, I'll be very cross."

She fired up her soldering iron. The smell of rosin and melting solder filled the air, a scent that, to Angelica, smelled like hope.

For the next three hours, she didn't exist. There was only the circuit. She was a surgeon of silicon and copper. She bypassed the safety relay using a bridge wire she stripped from a heating element. She reinforced the cracked chassis with patches of lightweight polymer she melded with a heat gun. She cleaned the optics with a microfiber cloth she kept in a sealed bag for special occasions.

She found the sensory chip—the part that had saved the drone from being totally lobotomized. It was a secondary backup, likely for navigation. She routed the reboot sequence through it.

"Okay," she whispered, her hand hovering over the power button. "Moment of truth."

She pressed it.

For a second, nothing happened. Angelica’s stomach sank.

Then, a fan whirred.

A low, rising tone filled the room, like a choir inhaling. The ocular sensor on the front of the drone flickered. Red. Red. Red.

Then, a steady, calm, piercing blue.

The drone lifted off the workbench. It didn't shudder or wobble. It rose smoothly, leveling out at eye height. The anti-grav repulsors hummed, a sound so clean and expensive it made her teeth ache.

Angelica let out a whoop, pumping her fist. "Yes! Who's the genius? I'm the genius!"

The drone rotated, scanning the room. The blue light washed over the piles of junk, the dirty walls, and finally settled on Angelica.

"System Reboot," the drone announced. Its voice was synthetic but smooth, андrogynous and calming. Designed to deliver bad news without causing panic. "Location unknown. GPS signal not found. Please return unit to Sector 1 Medical Bay immediately. Unauthorized handling is a Class B felony."

Angelica grinned, leaning back against the bench. "Sweetheart, you're about three miles straight down and two tax brackets away from Sector 1. You belong to House Ward now."

"House Ward is not a recognized medical affiliate," the drone replied instantly.

"It is today," she said. "And around here, we don't call the cops. We improvise. System override: owner designation."

"Unable to comply. biometric lock active."

"Bypass code: 0-0-0-Zero-Destitute."

The drone paused. "Error. Code not recognized."

"I'm kidding," Angelica said, reaching for a data-cable. "I'm going to have to root you. Hold still."

She plugged the cable into the port she'd just repaired. Her terminal screen lit up with scrolling code. She began the process of cracking the drone's loyalty protocols. It would take time to fully unlock it, to make it hers, but the hardware was working. It was alive.

She was rich. She could sell this for... for enough. Enough to buy filters. Enough to buy real food, not the nutrient paste that tasted like gray. Enough to maybe, just maybe, move up a level.

"Angie?"

The voice was small. It cut through her triumph like a razor wire.

The grin vanished from Angelica’s face. The mechanic, the scavenger, the master of the Silt—she dissolved. In her place stood a terrified girl.

She turned towards the plastic curtain.

"Leo?"

A sound came from behind the plastic. A cough.

It wasn't a normal cough. It didn't sound like a throat clearing. It sounded like gravel rattling inside a tin can. It was wet, heavy, and deep. It sounded like drowning.

Angelica ripped the headset off her head, throwing it onto the bench. She crossed the room in two strides, her boots heavy on the metal floor. She hesitated at the curtain, taking a breath, composing her face. She forced a smile she didn't feel.

She pulled the plastic back.

The air inside the clean room was noticeably better—she had three recyclers running in here on overdrive—but it still carried the faint, metallic taste of the Silt. Leo lay on a cot pushed against the wall.

He was ten, but looked seven. His skin was pale, almost translucent, the blue veins tracing roadmaps across his temples and wrists. His chest was a cage of ribs that heaved with every breath. He was clutching a battered plush rabbit, its fur matted and worn bald in spots.

He looked up at her, his eyes dark and circled with exhaustion.

"I heard a noise," he whispered. His voice was raspy. "Who were you talking to?"

"I brought a friend," Angelica said softly, kneeling beside the cot. She brushed the hair back from his forehead. He was burning up. "Leo, look."

She gestured to the workbench. The drone was hovering there, its blue eye watching them.

Leo’s eyes widened. "A... a floater? A real one?"

"A Model 7-Alpha," Angelica said, panic clawing at her throat as she listened to his breathing. It was worse. It was so much worse than yesterday. "Top of the line. The doctors use these upstairs."

"Is it... is it for me?"

"You bet it is," Angelica lied. She hadn't brought it for him. She had brought it to sell. to buy food. To buy time. But looking at him now, seeing the way his chest hitched...

"Drone," Angelica barked. "Come here. Priority One."

The drone rotated. "Command recognized. Priority One." It floated over, entering the clean room.

"Scan subject: Leo Ward," Angelica ordered.

The drone hovered over the bed. "Scanning."

A grid of blue laser light fanned out from its ocular sensor, washing over Leo's small body. It moved from his head to his toes, then focused on his chest. It lingered there. The blue light turned amber. Then a flashing red.

A harsh, dissonant beep filled the room.

"Diagnosis complete," the drone said. The calm voice was suddenly terrifying.

"Tell me," Angelica said. Her hands were gripping the edge of the cot so hard her knuckles were white.

"Subject exhibits advanced particulate accumulation in the bronchial tree and alveolar sacs," the drone reported. "Diagnosis: Acute Particulate Fibrosis. Colloquially known as 'The Under-Lung'."

Angelica closed her eyes. She knew it. Everyone knew it. It was the Silt's way of claiming its own. You breathed the dust, the metal shavings, the chemical residue. It coated your lungs, hardening them, turning them into stone until you couldn't take a breath.

"Stage?" Angelica asked.

"Stage 4," the drone said. "Vital capacity at thirty percent and dropping. Excessive fluid buildup detected."

"Treatment," Angelica demanded. "Give me the treatment."

"Option 1: Genetic Resequencing," the drone listed. "Replaces damaged tissue with cloned organ grafts. Available at Zenith Medical Center."

"We can't do that," Angelica whispered. That was a million-credit procedure. "Option 2."

"Option 2: Corticosteroid flush and nanomolecular scrubbing agents. Administered via inhalation. Followed by long-term oxygen therapy."

"Okay," Angelica said. "Okay. We can do that. Write me a prescription. Tell me what chemical compounds I need. I can mix them. I have chemistry kits."

"compounds required: Tetrahydrozaline-Beta, A-grade Steroid mix, Nanite batch 404."

Angelica frose.

She didn't have those. She didn't have anything close to those. Those were restricted compounds. Zenith tech. You couldn't scavenge nanites. They expired. They were controlled.

She looked at her shelves. She had aspirin. She had homemade antibiotics grown from mold on bread. She had unfiltered oxygen tanks she’d stolen from a welding site.

She had nothing.

"Leo," she said, turning back to him.

He was looking at the drone, a small, sad smile on his face. "It's a cool robot, Angie," he whispered. Then he coughed again. His body convulsed, his back arching off the cot. He gasped for air, a high, thin whistling sound.

Angelica grabbed him, holding him upright, rubbing his back. "Breathe, Leo. Just breathe. I've got you."

The fit passed. He slumped back, exhausted.

"I'm not hungry," he murmured, answering the question she hadn't asked. "My chest just hurts... a little."

"It's not okay," Angelica whispered, the tears burning her eyes. She refused to let them fall. "It's not going to be okay."

She stood up.

She looked at the drone. It hung there, indifferent, a messenger of death in a shiny white shell. It monitored. It diagnosed. It recorded. But it couldn't help. It was a box of sensors with no hands.

_It's garbage,_ she thought. _Just like everything else down here._

But the _information_...

"Drone," she said, her voice hard. "You have access codes. For the Medical Grid. For the dispensaries in Sector 1."

"Access Restricted," the drone replied. "Authorization required."

Angelica grabbed her hyper-spanner from the bench. She turned on the sonic emitter. She pointed it at the drone's face.

"My authorization is that I have a sonic drill and you have an off switch," she snarled. "And I know exactly where your memory core is. If you don't unlock the grid coordinates, I will lobotomize you and use your casing for a planter. Unlock. Now."

The drone hesitated. Its logic processors whirred. It calculated the probability of her threat.

"Threat assessment: Credible," it chirped. "Bypassing security protocols. Accessing Medical Grid."

A holographic map sprang to life in the air. It was a detailed schematic of the Upper City—Sector 1. It showed the pristine towers, the clean streets, the parks. And it showed glowing green dots. Dispensaries. Warehouses. Hospitals.

Angelica stared at the map. It was a map of heaven. And she was going to have to break in.

She studied the ventilation shafts. The maintenance elevators. The waste chutes—the tubes she knew so well from the bottom. If things could come down... maybe things could go up.

She memorized it. Every turn. Every sensor sweep. Every guard patrol the drone had on file.

She lowered the tool. She took a deep breath. She put her jacket back on, ziping it up to her chin. She grabbed her Haptic Glove—a heavy, armored gauntlet she used for crushing locks and lifting heavy scrap. She strapped it onto her right hand.

She went back to the cot. Leo was half-asleep, his breathing shallow and rapid.

"Leo," she whispered.

He opened one eye.

"I have to go out for a bit," she said. "Just a quick run. A night run."

"Dark," he mumbled.

"I know. But I'm going to get you the good medicine," she said. "The stuff the rich kids use. The stuff that makes you breathe like a wind turbine."

"Come back?"

"Always," she said. She leaned down and kissed his sweaty forehead. "I promise. I will buy the sky for you, Leo. I'll bring it down here and wrap it around you."

She stood up and walked out of the clean room. She didn't look back. If she looked back, she wouldn't leave.

"Drone," she said. "Follow mode. You're my navigator."

"compliance," the drone said.

They exited the workshop, stepping back out into the roar of Sector 12.

The climb was brutal. Angelica didn't take the elevators; she didn't have the credits for the bribe. She took the ladders. Mile after mile of rusted rungs, climbing up the spine of the city. The air grew thinner, colder, but also cleaner. The smell of rot faded, replaced by the sterile scent of processed ozone.

They reached the transition zone—the rusted hatch that separated the Undercity from the lower maintenance levels of the Zenith.

Angelica paused, catching her breath. She looked up.

Through a gap in the heavy smog clouds, she could see the lights of the Spire. It towered kilometers into the sky, a needle of crystal and light piercing the heavens. It was beautiful. It was hateful.

Suddenly, the air flickered. A massive holographic projection ignited against the side of a nearby ventilation tower. It was five hundred feet tall.

It was The Emperor.

His face was a mask of gold, flawless and unmoving. His robes were white light. He held his hands out, palms up, as if he were holding the weight of the world. His voice boomed out, a recorded loop that played every hour on the hour.

_"Citizens. The Order is the Life. The Gear turns for the Good of All. Unity. Purpose. Silence."_

Angelica stared at the giant, golden face. He looked so benevolent. So caring.

"Nice mask, old man," she spat, her voice lost in the wind. "But we all know there's just wires underneath."

She looked at her drone, hovering faithfully beside her.

"I don't fix things to make them work, metal-head," she said to it, though she was really talking to the hologram. "I fix things to prove they're broken. And this whole city? It's broken. It's running on bad code."

She gripped the handle of the hatch. It was locked, of course.

She raised her Haptic Glove. The servos whined as she clenched her fist. She punched the locking mechanism. Metal sheared. Sparks flew. The door groaned open.

"Let's go void the warranty," Angelica said, stepping into the darkness of the shaft that led upward. "Let's show them what a couple of rats can do to their shiny machine."

She began to climb.

---

The ascent through the transition zone was a journey through the geological strata of a dead civilization. The lower levels were ancient concrete, crumbling and reinforced with hasty plas-steel patches. Then came the industrial lattice—heavy iron beams, riveted and solid, the bones of the old world. As she climbed higher, the materials changed. Sleek composites. Carbon-fiber weaving. Surfaces that repelled dirt and gleamed with internal luminescence.

Her muscles burned. Every pull was a battle against gravity, a reminder of the planet trying to drag her back down to the mud. She kept a rhythm. Hand, foot, hand, foot.

_For Leo._ Hand. _For Leo._ Foot.

The drone drifted silently beside her, its blue eye casting long, dancing shadows on the shaft walls.

"Warning," it chimed, its voice echoing in the vertical tunnel. "Entering High-Security Zone. Sector 8 Maintenance Access. Biography scan required for entry."

"Put a sock in it," Angelica grunted, hauling herself up another ten feet. "Can you jam the local sensors?"

"I am a medical unit," the drone sounded almost offended. "I do not have electronic warfare capabilities."

"Improvise," she said. "Output a distress signal on the maintenance frequency. Tell them... tell them there's a bio-hazard leak in the sub-basement. False positive."

"Lying is contrary to my programming."

"Saving a life is your programming," Angelica countered, hooking her leg over a conduit to rest for a second. "And if I get caught, Leo dies. Logic that out."

The drone paused. Its processor whirred. "Logic acceptable. Broadcasting bio-hazard warning. Level 4 priority. That should divert local automated security for approximately twelve minutes."

"Good boy."

She started climbing again.

Twelve minutes later, she reached the hatch to Sector 1.

It wasn't a hatch, really. It was aniris value. A circular door of interlocking plates that dilated open. It was sealed tight.

Angelica checked her map. This opened into a service corridor behind a cosmetic surgery clinic. High-end. Lots of drugs.

She placed her ear against the cold metal. Silence. No footsteps. No hum of cleaning bots.

"Open it," she whispered to the drone.

"I do not have the—"

"You have the medical codes," she reminded it. "This is a medical facility. You are a medical drone. Tell the door you're a delivery. Tell it you have... I don't know, fresh kidneys or something."

"I am not carrying kidneys."

"You are carrying _me_," Angelica said. "And I have kidneys. Technically true."

The drone seemed to sigh—a simulated release of air from its vents. It floated forward. A small interface arm extended, jacking into the door's port.

Blue lights flashed on the locking mechanism. Then green.

_Hiss._

The iris dilated.

Angelica pulled herself up and through, rolling onto the floor.

She wasn't in the Silt anymore.

The floor was white tile, polished to a mirror shine. The walls were soft beige, lit by indirect, warm lighting that made her eyes ache after the darkness of the shaft. The air smelled of lavender and antiseptic—a smell so clean it felt like it was scrubbing her insides.

She stood up, checking her boots. She'd wiped them, but they still left faint, ghostly outlines of gray dust on the pristine white.

"Contaminant detected," a wall speaker chirped politely.

"Shhh," Angelica hissed.

She moved down the corridor, keeping low. She checked corners. Her reflection in the glass walls startled her—a dark, grime-streaked phantom in a world of light. She looked like a monster. She looked like the thing parents up here told their kids about to make them eat their vegetables.

_The Scavenger._

She reached the storage room. It was locked with a bio-print scanner.

"Drone," she signaled.

The drone floated up. "This requires a human handprint authorized by the Medical Board."

Angelica looked at her gloved hand. Then she looked at the drone. Then she looked at the keypad.

"They threw you away," she said. "They de-authorized you."

"Correct."

"But did they update the local database?"

The drone paused. "Updates are pushed weekly. Today is... Tuesday. Update is due in four hours."

"So as far as this door knows, you're still staff."

"Technically... yes."

"Hack it. Trick the sensor into thinking my hand is... Dr. Whoever owned you."

"Dr. Aris," the drone supplied. "He had a distinctive bio-rhythm. I have it on file."

"Emulate it. Pulse it through the interface."

The drone extended a lead, touching the side of the panel. "Syncing bio-rhythm... pulse active."

Angelica placed her gloved hand on the scanner.

The light swept red. Then, it flickered. The drone buzzed, feeding the false signal.

Green.

_Click._

The door slid open.

Angelica slipped inside. It was a pharmacy. Rows of shelves lined the walls, stocked with vials, inhalers, blister packs, and injectors. It was a treasure trove. It was enough wealth to buy Sector 12.

But she wasn't here for credits.

"Where is it?" she demanded. "The fibrosis treatment."

"Aisle 4. Shelf B. Blue labeling."

She sprinted. She found it. _Respi-Clear_. _Nano-Scrub_. _Lung-Life_.

She grabbed handfuls. She stuffed them into her pockets, into her harness pouches, down her shirt. She grabbed a box of sterile injectors. A bag of saline.

"We're done," she said, her heart pounding so hard she felt dizzy. "We have it."

"Alert," the drone said suddenly. "Security update received. Door access log flagged. Unrecognized mass displacement in storage."

"They know?"

"They suspect. Silent alarm triggered."

"Time to go."

She turned to run.

The door she entered through slid shut. The red light above it began to strobe.

"Lockdown initiated," a calm female voice announced over the intercom. "Security team dispatched. Please remain where you are. A compliance officer will assist you shortly."

"Assist me with a baton," Angelica muttered. "Drone, is there another way out?"

"Ventilation output. Ceiling. Twenty feet up."

Angelica looked up. A small grate. Too high to jump.

She looked at the shelves. Metal. Bolted to the floor.

"I can't reach it."

"I can," the drone said.

"You can't carry me. You have a ten-pound payload limit."

"I can unbolt the grate," the drone said. "And drop a line."

"You don't have a line."

"I have a winch," the drone said. "For lifting stretchers. It is rated for... two hundred pounds."

Angelica stared at it. "You have a winch?"

"Standard equipment on Search and Rescue models. I am... was... a SAR unit before I was assigned to the clinic."

"Go!"

The drone shot up. It extended a small laser cutter—another medical tool for cutting casts—and sliced the bolts on the grate. The metal clang of the grate hitting the floor was deafening.

A cable dropped.

Angelica grabbed it. "Pull!"

The little drone whined. The motors screamed. But it lifted. It was slow, agonizingly slow. Angelica scrambled up the shelves, using them as a ladder to assist, kicking off bottles and boxes. Glass shattered. Pills rained down like hail.

She reached the ceiling. She grabbed the edge of the vent.

The door to the pharmacy hissed open.

Three guards in black armor, faces covered by riot helmets, burst in. They held stun-batons that crackled with blue electricity.

"Halt!"

Angelica hauled herself into the vent.

"Go, go, go!" she screamed at the drone.

The drone zipped in after her. She grabbed the grate—hot from the laser—and jammed it back into place just as a stun bolt sizzled against the metal, sparks showering her face.

She scurried backwards into the dark, the drone leading the way.

"That was close," the drone said.

"Too close," Angelica gasped. She patted her jacket. The medicine clattered. Hard plastic. "But we got it."

She looked at the drone in the dim light of the vent.

"You lied," she said. "You told the door you were Dr. Aris. You broke protocol."

"I... improvised," the drone said.

Angelica smiled. A real smile this time. Sharp and dangerous.

"Welcome to the family," she said.

They began the long crawl back down to the dark. Back to the Silt. Back to Leo.

She had voided the warranty. And she was just getting started.

# End of Chapter 1
