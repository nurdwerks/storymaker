## Chapter 8: The Bonding

### Scene 1: The Menagerie

- **Key Event:** The Bonding Fields are a mix of high-tech zoo and prison containing Synth-Beasts—bio-engineered weapons including Chrome-Tigers and Wyverns.

- **Key Event:** Candidates must project Resonance to prove worthy of partnership. Bonding isn't guaranteed; rejected candidates may be ignored or eaten.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Stands apart from the anxious group, grinning with predator excitement, wanting "the big one."

---

### Scene 2: The Failures

- **Key Event:** A Squad Silver boy approaches a Fire-Drake demanding obedience. The Drake senses his fear (cortisol spike) and blasts his boots with plasma.

- **Key Event:** Halloway criticizes the attempt: it's about matching resonance frequency, not domination.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Analyzes that the boy projected fear (which smells like prey) and concludes Halloway is wrong—these weapons want a user who knows how to use them, not a friend.

---

### Scene 3: The Choice

- **Key Event:** Angelica ignores the flashy Prime specimens and finds the "Reject" pile—a dusty cage containing a pile of scrap metal resembling a smashed Gryphon.

- **Key Event:** Halloway dismisses it as inert, unresponsive to biological resonance, scheduled for scrapping. But Angelica hears a faint mechanical heartbeat: "Tick... tick... tick."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "It's not dead. It's waiting."

---

### Scene 4: The Connection

- **Key Event:** Angelica ignores warnings about the defense capacitor and touches the Gryphon with a mechanic's touch, visualizing her Pride and drive as a key to force the stuck gear to turn.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "You aren't dead. You're just unwound. You've forgotten what you're for."

- **Key Event:** The Clockwork Gryphon (Aeon) reactivates—rust flakes off, gears spin, wings of steel knives unfold. It's cat-sized but dense with old-world alloy.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Professor Halloway:** "Impossible. That unit is... it's a prototype. It shouldn't function without a Master Key. It killed the last three handlers who tried to touch it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I am the key."

- **Key Event:** Aeon hops onto Angelica's shoulder (50 pounds), and she stands taller, feeling the weight like armor.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "You called him broken. Good. So am I. Broken things know how to survive because they know how to put themselves back together."
