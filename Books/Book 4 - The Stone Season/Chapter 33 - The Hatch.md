### Scene 2: The Obstacle

- **Key Event:** The hatch is frozen shut by centuries of vacuum-seal and structural shifting; Ria (still paralyzed) suggests using her internal core as a localized heat source.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Offers to "burn out" her remaining functional logic boards to provide the thermal expansion needed to crack the seal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I'm a heater now. My last function. Make it count."

### Scene 3: The Crack

- **Key Event:** Ria’s core glows white-hot, and with a thunderous groan of metal, the hatch seal shatters, allowing the group to pry the door open.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Sobbing, she thanks Ria for her sacrifice, promising to rebuild her yet again.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "You did it, Ria. You're the strongest thing on this ship."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (Static):** "Logic... satisfied... stars... pending..."

### Scene 4: The Revelation

- **Key Event:** The hatch opens not to another room, but to a narrow observation tube; the group enters and sees the "Airlock" indicator for the first time.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Look at the pressure gauge. The atmosphere outside is... non-existent. We really are in a box in the dark."
