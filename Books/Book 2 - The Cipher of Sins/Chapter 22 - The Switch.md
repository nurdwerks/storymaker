## Chapter 22: The Switch

### Scene 1: The Hesitation / "Petal & Stem" - Parlor

- **Key Event:** The standoff is over, but the threat isn't. Duke Grey’s men are massing outside.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night stands by the window, peering through the cracks in the boarded-up glass.
- **Key Event:** "They're bringing up a breacher," he says. "A kinetic ram. They'll be through the wall in five minutes."
- **Key Event:** He looks back at Angelica. She is bandaged, pale, but alive.
- **Key Event:** He thinks about the orders he was given. _Bring her to the menagerie. Unmarked._
- **Key Event:** He thinks about what happens to "pets" in the Duke's care. His sister, Meridia, was a "guest" once. She came back... different. Hollow.
- **Key Event:** "You're thinking about giving me up," Angelica says quietly.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen looks at her. "I'm thinking about survival."
- **Key Event:** "Yours or mine?"
- **Key Event:** "Both," Kaelen says. "If I give you to him, you live. He won't kill his prize."
- **Key Event:** "Living isn't existing, Kaelen," Angelica says. "You of all people should know that. You're a weapon. You exist. But do you live?"
- **Key Event:** The question hits him like a physical blow. She is the only person who hasn't seen him as a tool. A "Perfect Soldier."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He realizes that Angelica is the only person who hasn't seen him as a weapon, triggering a major shift in his loyalty.

### Scene 2: The Warning / Parlor

- **Key Event:** Kaelen walks over to her. He lowers his voice.
- **Key Event:** "You don't understand what he does," he says. "He uses Gene-Keys. He'll put you in a fugue state. You'll be awake, but you won't be _there_. You'll just be... a womb. A biological factory for his experiments."
- **Key Event:** Angelica's eyes widen. "A vessel," she whispers. "Just like Vane said."
- **Key Event:** The horror of it is absolute. To be reduced to biology. To be a function.
- **Key Event:** She grips the knife tighter. "Then I won't let them take me."
- **Key Event:** "You can't fight an army, Princess."
- **Key Event:** "I can die," she says. "I will not be a vessel. I will not be a factory. I am Angelica Ward."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen sees the resolve in her face. It terrifies him.
- **Key Event:** "If they can't control the Captain," he mutters, quoting an old military maxim, "they create a Captain they can control."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her terror at being reduced to a "vessel" or a "function" drives her to a final, desperate resolve to die rather than be taken.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "If they can't control the Captain, they create a Captain they can control."

### Scene 3: The Choice / Parlor

- **Key Event:** _BOOM._ The front wall shudders. The kinetic ram is hitting.
- **Key Event:** "Time's up," Ria says, checking her ammo. "I have three magazines left. That's about thirty seconds of suppressive fire."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen looks at the door. He looks at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** He has spent twenty years following orders. Following the Chair.
- **Key Event:** But the Chair is empty. The heart is here.
- **Key Event:** _Snick._
- **Key Event:** He sheathes his sword. The shadows around him vanish.
- **Key Event:** "The basement," he says. "There's a sewage output. It drains to Sector 4. The slums."
- **Key Event:** Angelica blinks. "You're letting us go?"
- **Key Event:** "I'm giving you a head start," Kaelen says. He picks up a heavy table and shoves it against the door.
- **Key Event:** "What about you?"
- **Key Event:** Kaelen draws his sword again. "I'm going to hold the door."
- **Key Event:** "They'll kill you," Angelica says.
- **Key Event:** "They'll try," Kaelen smiles. It is a terrifying smile.
- **Key Event:** "It's time I served something real," he says. "Something with a pulse."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He makes the ultimate choice to serve "the heart" (Angelica) over "the chair" (the Founders), effectively committing social and career suicide.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "It's time I served something real. Something with a pulse."

### Scene 4: The Betrayal / "Petal & Stem" - Front and Basement

- **Key Event:** "Night!" Duke Grey's voice booms over the loudspeaker. "Open this door! Deliver the package!"
- **Key Event:** Kaelen doesn't answer. He stacks chairs. He creates a kill-box.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stops at the basement stairs.
- **Key Event:** "Why?" she asks.
- **Key Event:** "Go, Angelica," Kaelen says, not looking back. "Run before I remember I am a soldier. Run before the shadows call me back."
- **Key Event:** She runs.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen stands alone in the parlor. He feels light. He has just committed high treason. He has thrown away his rank, his house, his life.
- **Key Event:** And he has never felt more free.
- **Key Event:** The door splinters. The first soldier bursts in.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen laughs.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He smiles genuinely for the first time, experiencing the "bitter, triumphant" freedom of his betrayal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Go, Angelica. Run before I remember I am a soldier. Run before the shadows call me back."
