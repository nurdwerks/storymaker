## Chapter 9: The Anomaly

### Scene 1: The Test

- **Key Event:** The Observation Deck.
- **Detailed Description:** The Headmaster and Prelate Vane stand in the darkened command center of the Spire, a room bathed in the blue light of holographic projections. Below them, a dizzying array of screens displays real-time bio-metrics for every cadet in the Academy. They are focused on one specific feed: Angelica Ward. The data scrolling across the screen is anomalous, flashing with red warnings. Her sync rate with the Clockwork Gryphon is 100%, a theoretical impossibility for a first-time bonder, especially a "Null" who allegedly possesses no magic.

- **Key Event:** The discussion.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane places a gloved hand on the console, analyzing the creature perched on Angelica's shoulder in the feed. It is a relic from the Artificer Guild, a faction thought extinct after the Great Purge fifty years ago. It is a construct of gears, glass, and old magic—a heresy in the modern Zenith.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "She isn't a Null anymore. She entered the system. She found a backdoor. She bypassed the biological resonance requirement and substituted a mechanical one. It's... elegant. And heretical. She is rewriting the rules of engagement."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster:** "The creature requires a Chronometric Core to function. Those were destroyed. What is powering it? It should be immense dead weight."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "That is the question. Suggestion: We let it starve. We see what it eats when it gets desperate. Hunger reveals truth."

### Scene 2: The Feeding

- **Key Event:** The Mess Hall.
- **Detailed Description:** It is lunch hour in the Academy Mess Hall. The room is a cavernous space filled with the industrial noise of thousands of cadets eating. The air smells of overcooked vegetables and synthetic protein. Angelica sits at the far end of the Iron table, isolated. The mechanical gryphon, Aeon, is perched on her shoulder. He is motionless, a statue of bronze and steel, but his eyes—shutter-lens apertures—are tracking every movement in the room. He refuses the grey synthetic meat paste on Angelica's tray, turning his beak away with a click of disdain.

- **Key Event:** The theft.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica spots a real apple on the Squad Gold table. It is waxy, red, and fresh—a luxury item reserved for the elite. She decides to take a risk. As she walks by to return her tray, she uses a sleight-of-hand trick she learned in the Silt. She palms the apple, hiding it in her sleeve. She returns to her seat and offers it to Aeon. "Eat," she whispers. "It's all I have."

- **Key Event:** The decay.
- **Detailed Description:** Aeon bends his neck. His metallic beak touches the skin of the apple. He does not bite it. There is a faint _hiss_ of static, a warping of the air around the fruit. The apple instantly ages. Brown spots spread across the red skin like ink in water. The skin wrinkles and collapses inward. The flesh turns to brown mush, then dries out, then turns to grey dust. The entire process of decomposition—which should take weeks—happens in five seconds. The apple is gone. Aeon flutters his wings, energized, the gears in his chest spinning faster.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Aeon** — Revealed as an Entropy Feeder. He does not consume matter; he consumes the _time_ inherent in the object. He ate the apple's remaining duration.

- **Key Event:** The reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** The table goes quiet. Cadets nearby stare in horror at the pile of dust on the table. Halloway, a Gold cadet who saw the theft, points a shaking finger. "What did it do? That's... that's necrosis. It killed it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Ward... what the hell is that thing?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Digestion. Fast metabolism. Inefficient waste processing. He runs hot. It's just a prototype engine."
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Angelica lies smoothly, though she feels the cold sweat on her spine. If they know he eats time, the Wardens will dissect him within the hour.

### Scene 3: The Analysis

- **Key Event:** The library retreat.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica retreats to a quiet corner of the library, hiding behind stacks of data-tapes. She looks at Aeon. She realizes he is a living paradox. He steals time to power his gears. He accelerates entropy to infinity in localized fields. If he can do that to an apple, he can do it to a person. He could age a man to dust in a heartbeat.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She commits to the deception. She realizes she is harboring a monster, but he is _her_ monster. She protects him, knowing the trust she is building is dangerous.

### Scene 4: The Voice

- **Key Event:** The dorms.
- **Detailed Description:** That night, the barracks are dark. The only sound is the hum of the ventilation and the breathing of twelve sleeping cadets. Angelica lies in her bunk, staring at the concrete ceiling. Unexpectedly, she hears a voice. It is not auditory; it resonates in the bones of her skull. It sounds like grinding gears and ticking clocks translated into speech. It is Aeon communicating telepathically.

- **Key Event:** The conversation.
- **Detailed Description:** Aeon introduces himself. He is not a pet. He is an Archivist. A keeper of timelines.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon (Internal Voice):** "I am the Archivist. I keep the seconds. I eat the moments you waste. I hunger."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "The large female... Ria. She is dreaming of violence. Tasty. The adrenaline speeds up her local time. I could eat the edges of it. One year of her life entrophy would sustain me for a month."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No! No eating people. No eating dreams. You stick to fruit and inanimate objects. Do you understand?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "Inefficient. Biomass is plentiful. But... Limiters set. Protocol: Pacifist. Awaiting input. Pilot."

- **Key Event:** The burden.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica turns on her side, clutching the pillow. She realizes the magnitude of her situation. She is holding a time bomb—literally. She has bonded with a creature that eats the one thing no one in the universe can buy more of: time.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (whispered):** "He eats seconds, minutes, hours. He is the most expensive pet in the universe. And I have to feed him before he feeds on me."
