## I. Role in the Story

The High Chamberlain is an ancient man who carries the Emperor’s seal. He represents the peak of Zenith bureaucracy and the religious devotion the state demands for its (potentially holographic) leader.

- **The Devotion:** He bows so low his nose touches the floor, modeling the extreme submission the Imperial Court requires.
- **The Hostility:** He treats Angelica as an assassin or a pollutant, constantly stepping between her and the Throne. "Stand back, Silt-rat," he warns. "You pollute the Royal Air."

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 29: The Vacuum](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2176-2185)
- **Defining Quote:** "It flickered... The face... it flickered." (Reveals flaw: PRIDE/BLIND FAITH)
