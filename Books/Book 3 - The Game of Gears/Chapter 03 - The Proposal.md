## Chapter 03: The Proposal

### Scene 1: The Garden

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward wanders through the Imperial Gardens, located in the suspended "Green Ring" of the Zenith.
- **Detailed Description:** The Garden is a masterpiece of bio-engineering. Trees from old Earth have been cloned and perfected—their leaves a uniform emerald green, their bark free of blemishes. Flowers bloom in geometric patterns, their colors coordinated by the season cycles. There are no insects, only micro-drones that pollinate with silent efficiency. The air is perfumed and temperature-controlled to a pleasant 72 degrees. A holographic sun hangs in the domed ceiling, casting perpetual golden light.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels suffocated. She touches a rose. It feels waxy, almost plastic. She misses the mold and wet iron of the Undercity. There, things rotted, but they also grew wild. Here, everything is preserved in a state of suspended animation. It feels like a mausoleum.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She finds a small weed growing in a crack in the pavement—a dandelion. It is the only real thing in the garden. She smiles, shielding it with her boot from a cleaning drone. She expresses a preference for the "ugly, smelly, but alive" aspects of her home over this sterile perfection.

### Scene 2: The Suitor

- **Key Event:** Duke Valerius Grey, head of House Grey and Vane's primary political rival/ally, approaches Angelica.
- **Detailed Description:** Grey is a handsome man, his features symmetrical and sharp. He wears a suit of grey silk that shimmers like oil. He moves with the predatory grace of a large cat. He has been watching her. He steps out from behind a topiaried hedge, blocking her path.
- **Key Event:** Grey discusses his philosophy of control.
- **Detailed Description:** He gestures to the garden. He explains that chaos is the enemy of civilization. The Undercity is chaotic; the Zenith is ordered. He believes that humanity's destiny is to transcend nature through engineering.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Duke Valerius Grey:** "You look at this and see a cage. I see a masterpiece. Nature is too chaotic. It is wasteful. We improved it. We edited out the rot. We made it efficient."
- **Key Event:** Grey reveals his interest in Angelica.
- **Detailed Description:** He steps closer, invading her personal space. He touches a lock of her hair. He knows who she is—the daughter of the original Captain, the carrier of the Sangreal bloodline. To him, she is not a person; she is a genetic asset, a key to legitimizing his claim to the throne.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Duke Valerius Grey:** "You are the Sangreal. The Founder's blood runs in your veins. You are valuable, Angelica. More valuable than this entire garden. You are the only thing in this city that I do not yet own."

### Scene 3: The Spores

- **Key Event:** Duke Grey releases a cloud of "Pax Spores" from a hidden compartment in his signet ring.
- **Detailed Description:** Grey twists the large emerald on his finger. A fine, golden dust puffs into the air between them. It glitters in the artificial sunlight. Angelica inhales it before she can react. The spores are a bio-engineered neuro-toxin designed to induce docility and euphoria.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels her mind clouding. Her heart rate slows. The fear and anger she felt a moment ago drain away, replaced by a warm, fuzzy feeling of acceptance. She wants to smile. She wants to agree with him. She realizes she is being drugged. She fights it. She bites her tongue—hard. The sharp, copper taste of blood cuts through the fog. The pain is an anchor.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She uses pain to maintain her agency. She stares at him, her eyes watering, but her mind sharpening. She forces her body to remain rigid, refusing to sway into his arms.

### Scene 4: The Ring

- **Key Event:** Duke Grey proposes marriage.
- **Detailed Description:** Mistaking her silence for compliance, Grey smiles. He produces a ring box. Inside is a platinum band set with a diamond that pulses with internal light. He explains the arrangement. It is a political union. She will be his Duchess. She will give him heirs. In exchange, she will live in luxury, and Leo will be cared for in the best hospitals.
- **Key Event:** Angelica identifies the technology in the ring.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks closely at the ring. She sees the faint tracery of circuitry within the platinum band. It isn't just jewelry; it is a tracking device. A restraint. A collar. It contains a micro-injector for the Pax Spores, ensuring she would remain permanently docile.
- **Key Event:** Angelica rejects the proposal.
- **Detailed Description:** She steps back. She spits the blood from her mouth onto the pristine white pavement. It is a shocking, vulgar gesture. Grey recoils.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Duke Valerius Grey:** "I am offering you a leash, yes. But it is a very expensive leash. It is diamond and platinum. Most people in this city would kill to wear it. Do not be a fool, child. You are alone."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm not alone. I have my ghosts. And I am allergic to platinum... and slavery. Keep your ring, Duke. If I want jewelry, I'll build it myself."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She turns her back on him and walks away, leaving him standing in his perfect garden. She knows she has made a powerful enemy, but she feels free.

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Scenes:** Break each chapter into component scenes based on location changes, time jumps, or POV shifts.
2. **Key Events:** Bullet point all significant actions, revelations, or plot progressions.
3. **Detailed Description:** This is the primary place to expand the word count. Describe the environment, the sensory details (smell, sound, temperature), and the specific physical actions of the characters.
4. **Internal Conflict:** Add this section where characters are facing difficult choices or emotional turmoil.
5. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
6. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
7. **Flexibility:** Not every key event requires both a defining moment and dialog—include what applies. You may add custom headers (e.g., **The Memory**, **The Calculation**) to better organize complex information.
