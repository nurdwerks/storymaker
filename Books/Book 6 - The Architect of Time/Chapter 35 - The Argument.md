## Chapter 35: The Argument

### Scene 1: The Control Room

- **Key Event:** Angelica argues with Torin about his plan to stay behind.
- **Detailed Description:** The Control Room of the Time Engine is a sphere of rotating brass gears and glowing crystal conduits, suspended in the center of the Paradox. The hum of the machine is deafening, a physical vibration that rattles the bones and blurs vision. Torin, the Architect, stands at the central console. He is inputting the final sequence to destabilize the temporal field. His plan requires a manual override—someone has to hold the "Dead Man's Switch" lever down while the core overloads. That someone will be erased from history, their timeline unraveled to seal the breach. Angelica realizes what he is doing as he locks the coordinates for the *Aeterna*. She grabs his arm, trying to pull him away from the console. Her grip is frantic, desperate.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica is frantic. She loves him. After all the timelines, all the resets, all the suffering, she finally found him. And now, at the finish line, he is choosing to leave. She feels a desperate, clawing panic in her chest. She refuses to accept the cold logic of sacrifice. She wants to be selfish. She wants to save him, even if it risks the mission.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She tries to physically force her way past him to the console. She is willing to die in his place. She screams at him, her voice cracking over the roar of the engine. She hits his chest, trying to provoke him, trying to stop him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "No! You don't get to be the hero! We go together or we don't go at all! That was the deal! Don't you dare leave me alone!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "The deal was to save the future. This is the only way. The math doesn't allow for two pilots. One anchor, one traveler. That's the law."

- **Key Event:** Torin restrains her.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin catches her wrists. He is stronger than he looks, his strength amplified by the temporal energy coursing through his suit. He holds her firm, looking into her eyes. The chaos of the room seems to fade into the background. For a moment, it is just them in the eye of the storm. He looks at her with infinite sadness and infinite love.
- **Internal Conflict:** Torin is heartbroken. He wants to live. He wants to see the world they are saving. He wants to grow old with her. But he knows the variables. If he leaves the lever, the field collapses and the paradox consumes them both, and the ship. He has to be the anchor. He hates that he is right.

### Scene 2: The Kiss

- **Key Event:** Torin kisses Angelica goodbye.
- **Detailed Description:** He pulls her close, embracing her one last time. He kisses her. It is not a gentle kiss; it is desperate, final. It tastes of salt (tears), metallic ozone (the machine), and dust (time). It is a sensory memory he wants to imprint on her soul, a moment he wants to exist forever in a dying timeline. He transfers a small packet of data via their neural link during the kiss—the final codes for the *Aeterna*'s navigation computer.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels the data transfer. She realizes it is a goodbye letter written in code. She sobs against his chest, her resistance breaking. She realizes she can't stop him. She clings to him, trying to memorize the feel of his heartbeat.

### Scene 3: The Gift

- **Key Event:** Torin gives Angelica the datapad.
- **Detailed Description:** He steps back, breaking the embrace. He reaches into his coat and pulls out a heavy, brass-encased datapad. It contains the genetic database of humanity and the blueprints for the "City of Gears," the utopia he tried to build. It is his legacy. He presses it into her hands, folding her fingers over it. He physically pushes her toward the airlock door, guiding her away from the core.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Torin** — He smiles, a sad, tired smile that doesn't reach his eyes. He touches her cheek one last time, wiping away a tear. He is at peace with his equation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "I built the ship. You have to fly it. Navigate us home, my love. Don't look back at the explosion. Just fly. Be the Captain."

- **Key Event:** The door closes.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin hits the door control on the wall. The heavy blast door slides shut, separating them. Angelica pounds on the glass porthole, screaming. Torin turns his back to her, gripping the lever. He begins the sequence. The room fills with blinding white light as the timeline begins to erase itself.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica slides down the door, defeated. She clutches the datapad. She has the future in her hands, but she has lost her heart.
