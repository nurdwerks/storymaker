# Chapter 3: The Deal

Three hours.

That was how long hope lasted.

Angelica sat on the floor of the crawlspace, her back against the cold metal of the blast door, watching the timer on her retinal display tick away the seconds of her brother's life. The expensive, stolen, "miracle" drug she had risked her life for had burned through his system in less than an hour. It had cleared the Silt for a moment—just long enough for him to smile, to ask for water—and then the coughing had returned. Harder. Wet with blood.

The particulate matter in his lungs wasn't just dust; it was aggressive. It was adapting. The Zenith chemistry was too clean, too precise. It didn't know how to fight the dirty, mutated sludge of the Undercity.

She looked at the empty vial in her hand. It was beautiful glass. Useless glass.

The Silt had a rhythm. It was a slow, dragging pulse that beat in time with the dripping of condensation from the overhead pipes and the distant, grinding tectonic shifts of the city’s foundations. For eighteen years, Angelica Ward had lived inside that rhythm. She had learned to sleep through the screams of the scavengers fighting over scrap, to ignore the shuddering of the walls when the atmospheric processors vented their waste, to tune out the constant, low-level radiation hum that made your teeth ache if you focused on it for too long.

It was a heartbeat of decay. A wet, heavy thrum that vibrated in the soles of your boots and the cavities of your teeth. It was the sound of a city digesting itself.

But this silence was different.

It started ten minutes ago. First, the rats had stopped skittering in the walls. Then, the neighbor's generator had cut out. Then, the hum of the air recyclers died.

It wasn't the silence of an empty room. It was the silence of a held breath. The silence of a predator that had finally, after a long hunt, cornered its prey.

Angelica sat frozen, the Haptic Glove still heavy on her hand—she had rebuilt it in a frenzy of paranoia after returning from the vault. The air in the small, cramped room—usually warm and humid from the hydroponic heater she’d rigged from a busted toaster coil—felt suddenly ice-cold. The smell of rust and old water, usually a uniform background scent, seemed to sharpen, smelling like blood.

"Sparky," she whispered, her voice barely a tremor in the air. "Scan."

The drone, hovering near Leo’s bed, spun its sensor array. Its optical lens dilated, shifting from blue to amber to red. The tiny servos in its frame whined, a sound like a dying mosquito.

"Contact," Sparky chirped, its vocal synthesis hitching with static. "Multiple signatures. Thermal bloom detected. Proximity: Zero. Structural integrity compromised."

_Zero._

Angelica didn't even have time to stand.

The blast door—three inches of reinforced scavenged titanium she had welded herself, layer by agonizing layer—didn't explode. It didn't buckle under a battering ram. It simply dissolved.

A ring of white-hot plasma sparked into existence on the rusted iron surface, a perfect circle drawing itself with blinding speed. The light was searing, turning the shadows of the room into harsh, angular knives. The metal didn't just melt; it vaporized, turning into a cloud of sizzling gas that filled the room with the acrid stench of ozone and superheated steel. It smelled like lightning striking a garbage dump.

The circle completed in less than a second. The center of the door fell inward with a heavy _thud_, landing on the floor with a sound like a coffin lid closing. The edges of the perfect circle glowed a dull, angry cherry-red, dripping molten metal onto the concrete like wax from a hellish candle.

Through the smoke, they stepped.

Two of them.

They were massive. That was Angelica’s first thought—not fear, but a sudden, stark appreciation of scale. In the cramped crawlspace, they looked like titans squeezed into a dollhouse. They were clad in the pristine, pearl-white ceramic-plate armor of the Zenith Guard, the kind that looked less like clothing and more like the carapace of a giant, engineered insect. The armor gleamed in the dim light of the grow-lamp, unmarred by the grime and filth of the Silt. It was spotless. Holy. Terrifying.

They moved with the heavy, hydraulic whine of servo-assisted limbs—_whir-clunk, whir-clunk_—a sound that spoke of crushing power held in casual restraint. Their faces were hidden behind polarized golden visors that reflected the room back at itself in a distorted, fish-eye view.

One of them stepped forward, its boot landing on the fallen door piece, crushing the thick steel flat as if it were aluminum foil. The sound was sickening—a crunch of metal that vibrated in Angelica's chest.

"Target identified," the Warden stated. Implications of gender or humanity were stripped away by the vocal modulator, leaving only a flat, metallic baritone. "Subject: Ward, Angelica. Status: Non-compliant."

Angelica didn't scream. Screaming was a waste of oxygen. Instead, she moved.

She dropped her center of gravity, coiling her muscles like a spring, and launched herself at the Warden’s knee.

It was a suicidal move. The armor was rated to withstand small-arms fire and localized explosions. A kick from a barely-fed ninety-pound girl shouldn't have registered as more than a gnat hitting a windshield. But Angelica wasn't fighting with force; she was fighting with geometry.

She knew the design. She had studied the stolen schematics of Zenith tech for years, looking for the weaknesses in their perfection. The Mark-IV Sentinel Armor had a vulnerability in the lateral servo-actuator cabling behind the knee—a small, flexible bundle of wires exposed for mobility.

Her boot heel connected.

_Crunch._

Sparks showered the air—blue and violent. The Warden stumbled, its leg locking up as the servo seized. The massive figure lurched forward, off-balance, its shoulder slamming into the wall, cracking the concrete.

"Disengage!" the other Warden barked, stepping in.

Angelica didn't wait. She used the momentum of her rebound to scramble sideways, grabbing her hyper-spanner from the floor. It wasn't a weapon—it was a tool for loosening bolts on atmospheric scrubbers—but it was heavy, solid jagged steel.

She swung it with both hands, a feral scream tearing from her throat, aiming for the Warden's helmet sensor array.

The Warden didn't even flinch. It simply raised a gauntleted hand and caught the spanner in mid-air.

_Clang._

The impact vibrated up Angelica’s arms, rattling her bones. It felt like hitting a mountain. Her fingers went numb.

The Warden’s hand closed around the metal tool. The ceramic fingers didn't struggle; they just tightened. The steel of the spanner groaned, then bent, then snapped like a twig.

Angelica stared at the broken handle in her hand, her breath catching in her throat. The sheer, casual strength of it was impossible.

"Subject secured," the Warden said impassively.

A massive hand, the size of a shovel, clamped onto her shoulder. It wasn't a grab; it was a clamp. The pressure was immense, instant, and paralyzing. She felt her collarbone creak under the strain. He lifted her off the ground as if she weighed nothing, her feet kicking uselessly at the air.

"Leo!" she screamed, twisting in the grip, striking at the white armor with her bare fists. She punched the ceramic, her knuckles splitting, blood smearing on the white surface. "Don't touch him! He's sick! You'll kill him! Get away from him!"

Behind the first Warden, the second one had moved to the bed. It reached down and scooped Leo up in one arm, holding the boy against its chest plate like a sack of grain.

Leo was limp. Unconscious. His head lolled back, his mouth open, sucking at the air with wet, rattling gasps. He looked so small against the white armor, a smudge of dirt on a pristine canvas. His skin was gray, translucent, veins showing blue underneath like a map of a dying river system.

"Vital signs critical but stable," the second Warden reported, ignoring the boy's flaccid weight. "Transport protocols initiated."

"Put him down!" Angelica shrieked, tears springing to her eyes, hot and angry. She kicked the first Warden in the chest plate, leaving a muddy smear on the white ceramic. "He needs oxygen! He needs his meds! You're killing him!"

"We are preserving him," a new voice said.

The voice cut through the chaos like a scalpel. It was calm. Modulated. Smooth. And it came from the doorway.

Angelica stopped struggling, hanging limp in the Warden's grip, panting hard. She looked toward the entrance.

Prelate Vane stood there.

He hadn't entered the room; he hovered in the blasted opening, his white robes billowing slightly in the draft from the destroyed door. He looked out of place—a vision of high-church elegance amidst the rust and water stains. He held a handkerchief to his nose, not out of necessity, but out of disdain. The fabric was silk, embroidered with silver thread, contrasting sharply with the grime-smeared walls.

"Energy expended on resistance is energy subtracted from survival," Vane said, stepping inside. His boots didn't seem to touch the grime. "Do the math, Miss Ward. You are good at math. I have seen your schematics."

He lowered the handkerchief, revealing a faint, polite smile that didn't reach his glowing blue eyes.

"Put her down," he ordered softly.

The Warden dropped her.

Angelica hit the floor hard, landing on her hands and knees. She scrambled up instantly, backing toward Leo, placing herself between the Warden holding him and the door. She was unarmed, exhausted, and outmatched, but she bared her teeth like a feral dog protecting a pup.

"Give him back," she snarled, her voice shaking. "We had a deal. I got the vial. I did what you asked. Just... just give him the shot and leave us alone."

Vane chuckled. It was a dry, dusty sound.

"We did not have a deal, Miss Ward. I made an offer. You ran away before the terms were finalized. That is not a negotiation; that is a forfeiture."

"I took the deal!" she argued, desperate. "I took the vial! It didn't work! It wasn't enough!"

"Of course it wasn't," Vane said smoothly. "I told you. A patch. Not a cure. And you stole it, Miss Ward. You did not earn it."

He raised his right hand. The gauntlet on his wrist—a sleek, silver bracer—hummed.

"And now," he continued, "we must address the matter of your... potential."

"My potential?" Angelica spat. "To what? Steal more for you? I'm done. I'm out."

"You are never out," Vane corrected. "Not when you are a Null."

He flicked his wrist.

A cloud of black dust erupted from the gauntlet.

It moved like smoke, swirling through the air with a collective intelligence. It wasn't dust. It was the Swarm. Thousands of micro-drones, tiny magnetic insects, buzzing with a sound like a hive of angry hornets.

Angelica threw her arms up to protect her face, backing away until she hit the wall.

The Swarm ignored her face. It coalesced around her wrists and ankles.

_Snap. Snap._

The drones linked together, forming solid, black bands of metal. Magnetic shackles.

_Thrummm._

A pulse of magnetic force slammed her limbs together. Her wrists were yanked behind her back, locking with a metallic click. Her ankles snapped together. She fell forward, hitting the floor face-first, unable to catch herself.

The impact tasted like iron and dust.

Vane walked over to her. He crouched down, his robes pooling on the dirty floor. He reached out and tilted her chin up with a gloved finger, forcing her to look into the silver reflection of his face.

"Look at me," he commanded.

Angelica glared at him, blood trickling from her nose.

"You think this is cruelty," Vane said softly. "It is not. Cruelty is emotional. Cruelty is inefficient. I am a scientist, Miss Ward. I view the world through the lens of entropy. Order versus Chaos. Signal versus Noise."

He gestured around the room—at the dripping pipes, the rust, the darkness.

"This?" he waved a hand. "This is noise. The Silt is biological waste. It is the runoff of a society that produces too much and refines too little. And the people here? They are static. They absorb the background Resonance—the magic that leaks from the Core—and because they cannot process it, they rot. They get sick. They die. It is simple chemistry."

He stood up and walked over to Leo. The Warden holding the boy turned so Vane could inspect him.

A small medical drone detached from Vane’s shoulder and hovered over Leo, projecting a holographic map of his lungs into the air. The image was a web of red lines and jagged crystals.

"Observe," Vane said, pointing to the hologram. "Acute Silicate Crystallization. His lungs are turning to glass. It isn't a disease, Angelica. It is an incompatibility. His genetics reject the atmosphere of this planet. He is allergic to the world. Without a Grade-A clean-room environment, he has forty-eight hours before he asphyxiates on his own breath."

Angelica stared at the red map. She felt sick. The empty vial in her pocket felt suddenly light, useless.

"The vial..." she whispered. "The nanites..."

"Expired," Vane dismissed. "As predicted. The Resonance accumulated again. The crystals returned. And now you are back here."

He turned back to her. The blue eyes bore into her.

"But you," he said, stepping closer. "You are different."

He tapped the side of his head, near his temple.

"I am a Mage. A conduit. I was born with the genetic sequence that allows me to filter Resonance, to shape it, to turn the background radiation of the planet into energy. Power. It is a gift, yes, but it is also a burden. We are constantly filtering. We are constantly resisting the noise. It is like living in a room where a thousand radios are playing different stations at max volume, and you are the only one who can hear them."

He walked a slow circle around her, his voice dropping to a whisper.

"Most people in the Silt succumb to the noise. Their DNA unravels. They become monsters, or they simply dissolve. But you... you have lived in the static for eighteen years. Your parents—whoever those genetic failures were—must have been anomalies themselves. Perhaps they died because they couldn't handle the pressure. But they passed something on to you. A mutation. A silence."

He stopped in front of her.

"You have zero Resonance exposure, Miss Ward. Zero. You have lived in the Silt for eighteen years—in the highest concentration of toxic magical runoff on the continent—and your blood work is clean. Pristine. It is miraculous. It is impossible."

He crouched down again, his face inches from hers.

"You are a Null. Your body doesn't just filter the magic; it rejects it. It grounds it out. You are a walking dead-zone for Resonance. A black hole in the magical spectrum."

Angelica blinked, trying to process the words through the ringing in her ears. "So? So I'm immune to the sickness. Good for me."

"It makes you a blank slate," Vane whispered, his voice trembling with a strange, fanatical excitement. "A tabula rasa. I don't want a natural-born mage who thinks power is their birthright. They are arrogant. They are messy. They rely on instinct. They think the power belongs to them. I want a mage I can _code_."

He stood up, towering over her.

"You are a formatted hard drive, Angelica. And I intend to write my own operating system onto you."

Angelica struggled against the magnetic cuffs, gritting her teeth. "I'm not a computer. And I'm not your experiment."

"You are whatever I say you are," Vane replied coolly. "Because I hold the only currency that matters to you."

He pointed to Leo.

"I am making you an offer. Verify the terms."

He held up a hand, ticking off points on his fingers.

"One: You join the Iron Selection. The 105th Cohort of the Zenith Guard Academy."

"Two: You survive the training. Twelve squads enter. One squad graduates. The mortality rate is eighty-eight percent."

88%.

Angelica stopped struggling. Her mind, hard-wired for calculations, for salvage values, for risk assessment, instantly grabbed the number.

88% chance of death.

That meant a 12% chance of life.

The room seemed to tilt. The hum of the Wardens' armor faded into the background, replaced by a dull, throbbing roar in her ears—the sound of her own blood rushing.

_12%._

It was a terrible number. A failing grade. A suicide note.

But her mind didn't stay in the present. It fractured, spiraling backward, pulling up memories like files from a corrupted drive.

_Flashback._

_She was eight years old. The Silt was knee-deep after the acid rains of '98. She was scavenging near the venting ports of Sector 11, looking for copper wire. She found a bundle of rags in a crate marked "Biological Waste."_

_There was a baby inside. Tiny. Blue. Silent._

_A scavenger next to her—a man with no teeth named Grix—had spat on the ground. "Leave it. It's a lunger. Dead by morning."_

_Calculated Survival Probability: 0%._

_Angelica had picked up the bundle. She had carried it three miles back to her hideout. She had stolen formula from a corner store. She had stayed awake for three days straight, holding the baby upright so the fluid wouldn't pool in his lungs._

_He lived._

_Probability defied._

_Flashback._

_She was twelve. Leo was four. He was sitting on the floor of their shack, staring at a schematic she had drawn in the dust. It was a diagram of a water filter._

_"Why does the water go down?" he asked, his voice raspy._

_"Gravity," she said._

_"Can we fix gravity?"_

_"No. But we can build around it."_

_She looked at his hands. They were small, scarred, but steady. He was building a model out of scrap plastic. He wasn't crying about the cold. He wasn't crying about the hunger. He was building._

_Flashback._

_Last winter. The heater broke. The temperature dropped to twenty below. Leo's lips turned blue. His shivering stopped—which was bad. That meant hypothermia was setting in._

_Angelica had stripped the wiring from the wall. She had jury-rigged a connection to the main power conduit running outside their window. It was high voltage. Unshielded. If she touched the wrong wire, she would fry instantly._

_Risk of electrocution: 95%._

_She did it anyway. She worked with frozen fingers, wrapping the live wires, praying to a God she didn't believe in. The heater sparked. Then it roared to life._

_Leo woke up. He smiled._

_Probability defied._

The memories crashed back into the present.

She looked at Leo now. The hologram showed the red crystal creeping up his bronchial tubes. It was a map of a war he was losing.

If she stayed here? 0% chance. He died in 48 hours. Guaranteed.

If she fought? 0% chance. The Wardens would snap her neck before she could blink.

12%.

12% was betting on a long-shot horse with a broken leg in a race against wolves. It was insane. It was illogical.

But it was infinitely higher than zero.

She looked at Vane. He was waiting, his head cocked slightly to the side, observing her like a specimen in a jar. He expected her to break. He expected her to cry, to beg, to bargain for her own life.

He didn't know scavengers.

Scavengers didn't hope. Hope was passive. Hope was waiting for the rain to stop.

Scavengers calculated. And when the math said jump, you jumped. Even if the ledge was invisible.

The tears stopped.

Angelica felt a shift inside her. It was a physical sensation, like a gear clicking into place in her chest. The fear, the panic, the hot, messy grief—it all drained away, replaced by a cold, hard clarity.

She sat up. It was difficult with her hands bound behind her back, but she forced herself upright, pushing off the floor with her knees. She shook her hair out of her eyes. She looked Vane dead in the face. She didn't look up at him like a victim; she looked at him like a trader across a table.

"I have conditions," she said.

The Warden stepped forward, raising a gauntleted hand to strike her. "Silence, recruit. You are in no position to—"

Vane raised a hand. "Wait."

He looked at Angelica with genuine curiosity. "Conditions? You are in magnetic shackles. You are bruised, bleeding, and surrounded by superior force. You are nothing. But... The Emperor demands will. So I will listen. Speak."

Angelica took a breath. "Leo goes to the Zenith. Top-tier facility. Grade-A air scrubbers. Not a holding cell. A room."

"Standard procedure for dependents of Wardens," Vane nodded. "Granted."

"He gets a window," she said, her voice hard. "A real one. Not a screen. He likes the sky. I want him to see the nebula."

Vane raised an eyebrow behind his mask. "A view is expensive. Real estate in the Spire is premium."

"You want your 'formatted hard drive'?" Angelica challenged. "You want your 'variable'? That's the price. A window."

Vane stared at her for a long moment. Then, the corner of his mouth twitched.

"And?"

"And I want proof of life," she said. "Sent to my datapad. Every morning. timestamped. If I miss a day—if the feed cuts, if he looks sick, if he looks sad—I stop. I don't care if I'm in the middle of a war zone. I will walk away."

"You would be executed for desertion," Vane noted.

"Then I die," Angelica said flatly. "But you lose your experiment. You lose your investment. Do the math, Prelate. Is it worth it?"

Vane looked at her. Really looked at her. For a moment, the blue glow of his eyes seemed to dim, replaced by a sharp, calculating human intelligence. He saw it. He saw the shift. He saw the moment the girl died and the weapon was born.

He smiled.

"Agreed," he said. "A window facing the nebula. And a daily feed."

He tapped the golden crest on his chest—the stylized sunburst of the Zenith Emperor.

"This is His Selection," Vane intoned, his voice taking on the weight of ritual. "He seeks the strongest steel. If you survive, you serve Him. If you die, you feed Him. Do you accept the Emperor's bargain?"

Angelica looked at the crest. She hated it. She hated everything it stood for. It was the symbol that burned on the flags while the Silt starved. But one calculation remained.

"I accept," she said.

"Excellent," Vane said, turning away. "See? We are negotiating already. You have the soul of a politician, Miss Ward."

He snapped his fingers.

"Execute."

The room moved.

The Warden holding Leo turned and marched toward the hole in the wall. Through the smoke, Angelica could see a sleek, white medical shuttle hovering outside, docked against the side of the hab-block like a parasitic moth. The airlock hissed open, revealing a sterile white interior that stung the eyes.

"No!" Angelica lunged forward, straining against the cuffs. "Let me say goodbye! Just one second! Leo!"

The Warden ignored her. He carried Leo into the shuttle. The boy didn't wake. He looked so peaceful, floating away into the white light of the ship.

Those hands... those massive, crushing hands that had snapped her spanner... were holding him gently. That was something.

"Negative," the Warden holding her said. "Schedule is absolute. Transport initiating."

He grabbed her by the back of the harness and hauled her toward the other side of the room, toward the service elevator.

"Leo!" she screamed, thrashing.

The shuttle door began to close.

Angelica ripped her hand.

She didn't care about the pain. She wrenched her right wrist against the magnetic bond, twisting the joint until something popped. Skin tore. Blood slicked the metal cuff.

The magnet slipped. Just an inch. But it was enough to free her fingers.

She grabbed the datapad from her belt pouch.

Her fingers flew across the screen, blinded by tears, typing by muscle memory.

_I'm going to work. Big job. Don't worry about me. Be good. Eat your greens. I will buy the sky for you. - Angie_

She hit SEND.

_Message Sent._

The shuttle door sealed shut. A second later, the engines flared blue, and the ship shot upwards, disappearing into the smog.

He was gone.

Angelica slumped in the Warden's grip. The fight drained out of her, leaving her hollow.

"Transport," Vane ordered.

The Warden shoved her into the service elevator. Vane followed, stepping in with his pristine grace. The doors rattled shut, cutting off the view of the empty, destroyed crawlspace.

The elevator jerked, then began to rise.

It moved fast. Much faster than the rusty lifts of the Undercity. It engaged the magnetic rails of the Spire, shooting upward like a bullet.

Angelica slumped against the brass railing of the car. She watched the floor indicator numbers tick up.

_Level 12: The Silt._
The brown smog faded, replaced by the gray, industrial haze of the manufacturing district. Through the glass, she saw endless factories, their chimneys belching smoke. Thousands of workers, small as ants, marched in lines toward the gates. This was where the raw materials were processed. Where the hands bled to build the things the Zenith threw away. She saw the flash of plasma cutters in the yard, the sparks raining down like fireworks that nobody watched. It was a city of ghosts, built on the backs of people who would never see the sun they labored for.

_Level 10: The Mid-Levels._
The gray lightened to a dirty yellow. Neon signs flickered—"GIRLS," "STIMS," "CREDITS." The buildings here were cleaner, but crowded. Tenement blocks stacked on top of each other like Jenga towers. This was where the mid-level managers lived. The clerks. The people who thought they were free because they had a window, even if the window only looked at a brick wall. The streets were choked with traffic, hover-cars gridlocked in a sea of red taillights, honking in a chorus of frustration. It was the purgatory of the ambitious—close enough to smell the Zenith, but too poor to reach it.

The elevator continued its ascent, the pressure changes popping Angelica's ears with a rhythmic frequency. She watched the world change. She watched the color spectrum shift from brown, to gray, to yellow.

Then, at Level 8, the elevator slowed. A chime sounded—soft, polite, discordant with the speed they were traveling.

It stopped.

The doors didn't open. They were suspended between the sectors, hanging in a void between the Military District and the upper tiers. The view outside was of a massive, suspended transit ring—a highway of flying vehicles circling the Spire.

Vane turned to her. The blue light of his eyes was intense in the confined space of the car.

"A question, Miss Ward," he said.

Angelica didn't look at him. She stared through the glass at a transport barge hauling containers marked "BIO-HAZARD."

"I'm not in a chatty mood," she muttered.

"I reviewed the footage of your brother's care," Vane continued, ignoring her tone. "Last winter. The thermal records show a spike in energy consumption in your unit. You bypassed the safety regulators on the main conduit to power a heater. You were unshielded. The probability of electrocution was ninety-five percent."

He took a step closer. The air in the elevator felt charged, heavy with his presence.

"Why?" he asked. "Why take that risk? Mathematically, it was unsound. If you died, the boy would have frozen anyway. A logical machine would not have taken that gamble. It would have conserved body heat. It would have sought shelter elsewhere. It would not have touched the wire."

Angelica finally looked at him. She looked at the smooth, pale skin of his face, the artificial perfection of his eyes.

"That's why you'll never understand us," she said. "You think everything is math."

"Everything _is_ math," Vane corrected. "The universe is built on it."

"No," Angelica said. "Math is just the map. It's not the territory."

She held up her wrist, showing the raw, bleeding skin where the magnetic cuff had torn it.

"You calculate the odds," she said. "You weigh the risk. And then you add the one variable you can't code."

"And what is that?" Vane asked, genuinely curious.

"Luck," Angelica said. "Or desperation. Or love. Call it whatever you want. But a machine doesn't factor it in. A machine looks at 95% chance of death and shuts down. A scavenger looks at 5% chance of life and grabs the wire."

Vane stared at her. He didn't speak for a long time. The hum of the elevator's magnetic suspension was the only sound.

Then, slowly, a smile spread across his face. It wasn't the polite smile from before. It was something sharper. Something hungrier.

"Precisely," he whispered.

He reached out and pressed the button to resume the ascent.

"That is why you are here, Miss Ward," he said as the car jerked upward again. "You are here to teach the machines about luck. Or... to die trying."

The elevator surged past Level 8.

_Level 5: The Gardens._
Angelica blinked. Green. Actual green. Not the sickly green of algae, but the vibrant, deep emerald of trees. Parks suspended on anti-gravity platforms. Waterfalls cascading from the clouds. It looked like a dream. She knew people lived there who had never touched rust. Who had never coughed up black phlegm. It made her hate them.

_Level 1: The Zenith._
The elevator slowed. The air pressure stabilized. The glass cleared.

The sun hit her.

It wasn't filtered. It wasn't yellowed by smog. It was pure, white, blinding sunlight. It reflected off a city built of glass and gold. Spires twisted into the sky like frozen lightning. Bridges of hard-light connected floating platforms. Vehicles—sleek, silver, silent—wove through the air like schools of fish.

It was beautiful. It was terrifying. It was a lie built on top of a graveyard.

Angelica stood up.

She caught her reflection in the polished brass of the elevator door.

Her face was smeared with grease and blood. Her lip was split. Her eyes were red-rimmed and hollow. She looked like a rat that had been dragged out of a sewer.

She stared at herself.

"Goodbye, Angie," she whispered.

She wiped the blood from her lip with the back of her hand. She straightened her torn tunic. She reached up and pulled her hair back, tying it tight with a piece of wire from her pocket.

She took the fear. She took the grief. She took the image of Leo's limp body. And she pushed it all down. Deep down. Into the cold, dark place in her gut where she kept the things she couldn't afford to feel.

She locked the door.

She turned to face Vane.

Her eyes were dry. Her face was stone.

"Ambition is just survival with a better haircut," she said, her voice flat and cold. "If they want a monster... I'll build them one. And then I'll burn their house down."

Vane looked at her, his blue eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

"I look forward to the attempt," he said.

---

High above, in the penthouse suite of the Spire’s central needle, a woman sat on a chaise lounge of crushed velvet.

The room was a testament to excess. White marble floors veined with real gold. Statues of pre-war heroes carved from moon-ivory. A wall of windows that offered a panoramic view of the nebula swirling in the upper atmosphere. The air here didn't just smell clean; it smelled expensive—like crushed orchids and ozone.

Lady Corinne, known to the Zenith tabloids as "The Porcelain Doll," took a sip of tea from a cup that was worth more than the entire net GDP of Sector 12. The tea was real—grown in soil, not hydroponics. It tasted of earth and sunlight.

She was watching a holographic screen floating in the center of the room. It was displaying the live feed from Vane's helmet cam.

She watched Angelica stand up in the elevator. She watched her wipe the blood away. She heard the line about burning the house down.

Corinne smiled. It was a small, perfect smile. A smile that didn't show teeth, but hinted at bite.

"You were right, Vane," she murmured to the empty room, her voice soft and melodious. "She's feral. But she has good bones."

She set the tea cup down on a floating saucer. She swiped a finger across the air, pulling up a betting manifest.

_Iron Selection: 105th Cohort Odds._
_Favorite: House Ardor (3:1)_
_Underdog: Ward, Angelica (1000:1)_

She looked at the numbers. 1000 to 1. The kind of odds that made careers. The kind of odds that could bankrupt a lesser House if they bet wrong, or elevate them to the Council if they bet right.

She scrolled through the other candidates. There was Julian Ardor—golden-haired, genetically perfect, trained since birth in the finest fencing schools. His odds were solid, safe, and utterly boring. He would fight with honor. He would follow the rules. He would make for excellent, predictable television.

Then she looked back at Angelica. The girl was a mess of bruises and defiant, raw energy. She was a variable. A chaos engine.

"The audience loves a rebel," she mused. "They love a redemption arc. Or a tragedy. Either way, the ratings will be astronomical."

She tapped her comms-link, opening a channel to the Academy Administration.

"This is Lady Corinne. House Venatori. I wish to register a sponsorship."

"Name of candidate?" a computerized voice asked.

"Angelica Ward," Corinne said, watching the girl on the screen stare hatefully at the golden city. "Put her on the primetime roster. Pay her entry fees. And... send a fruit basket to the infirmary for the boy. Let's make sure the narrative has stakes."
