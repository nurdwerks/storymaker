## I. Role in the Story

Mister Sterling is Baron Gilded's personal appraiser and accountant. Equipped with cybernetic monocles that scan for value, he is the man who translates the Baron's gluttony into cold numbers.

- **The Interaction:** He treats people like currency or counterfeit coins. He frequently remarks on Angelica’s "low-grade material" within earshot, Reinforcing her status as a commodity rather than a person.
- **The Bond:** He and Gilded share private jokes about the "price of life," laughing at the desperation of those trapped in the Baron's debt.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 10: The Gala of Ghosts](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L838-854)
- **Defining Quote:** "A man is only as valuable as the numbers he produces. You, Sterling, have become a negative asset." (Reveals flaw: GREED)

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Detailed Description | The scene opens at the grand entrance of the Night Estate, a gothic mansion of black stone and silver filigree located on the outskirts of the Zenith district. The sky above is the artificial twilight of the ship's sleep cycle, casting long, mournful shadows. A column of armored Zenith Wardens marches up the driveway, their boots striking the cobblestones in unison. At their head is Mister Sterling, the High Chamberlain's chief auditor. He wears a suit of impeccable grey, holding a datapad like a weapon. The heavy iron gates, which have stood for three centuries, are forced open with a hydraulic ram. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Key Event | Sterling confronts Kaelen Night at the door. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Detailed Description | Kaelen stands alone on the steps. He is not wearing armor; he is dressed in the simple black tunic of his house. He looks tired. Behind him, the house staff huddle in fear. Sterling does not offer a greeting. He activates a holographic scroll, reading the writ of seizure aloud. The document is stamped with the golden seal of **The Emperor**—the authority no one questions, even though many suspect the truth. The Night family has defaulted on the "Ancestral Loans" taken to maintain their status. The interest has compounded beyond their ability to pay. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Dialog | **Mister Sterling:** "By order of **The Emperor**, Eternal Guardian of the Aeterna, pursuant to Section 4, Paragraph 12 of the Debt Concordat... this estate, its contents, and its biological assets are now the property of the State. You have ten minutes to vacate the premises." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Detailed Description | As she turns to leave, the lead Warden draws his pistol. He thanks her for her service—and shoots her in the back. She falls forward, the data-crystals scattering across the floor. Sterling steps over her body, checking his watch. |
