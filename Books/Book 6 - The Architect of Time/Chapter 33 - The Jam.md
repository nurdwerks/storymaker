## Chapter 33: The Jam

### Scene 1: The Warning / The Bridge of _Aeterna_

- **Key Event:** The _Aeterna_ is screaming. Not metaphorically. The hull plates are groaning under the gravitational shear of the wormhole.
- **Key Event:** Navigator Starla is plugged into the guidance chair. Suddenly, she screams, ripping her interface helmet off. Her eyes are streaming tears. "It blinded me! A flare! Right in the nav-core!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica spins her chair. "Status! Starla, report!"
- **Key Event:** _Computer:_ **"WARNING. FUEL ROD MISALIGNMENT. REACTOR SCRAM IMMINENT."**
- **Key Event:** The lighting on the bridge shifts from combat-red to emergency-amber.
- **Key Event:** Torin is already moving. He slides down the ladder from the upper engineering deck. "It's not a flare. It's a backwash. The manifold isn't venting the plasma."
- **Key Event:** Angelica types furiously. "We can't stop. If we drop out of warp now, the tidal forces will tear us into atoms. We're halfway through the throat."
- **Key Event:** The ship shudders violently. A cup of coffee on the console vibrates off the edge, splashing onto the floor. Unlike normal spills, the liquid floats for a second—a gravity glitch—before crashing down.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She built this ship. She knows every bolt, every line of code. She knows what that vibration means. The heart is skipping a beat. And in a wormhole, a skipped beat means death.

### Scene 2: The Diagnosis / Engineering Schematic

- **Key Event:** Angelica throws the main schematic onto the holographic table. It rotates, wireframe blue.
- **Key Event:** A red pulses deep in the reactor housing.
- **Key Event:** "There," Torin points. His hands are covered in grease and burns. "Primary fuel injector. Servo 4-Alpha. It's sheared."
- **Key Event:** Angelica zooms in. "It's wedged. The rod can't cycle. If we don't clear it, the core goes critical in..." She checks the readout. "...six minutes."
- **Key Event:** "Remote bypass?" Starla asks, wiping her eyes. She is trying to be brave, but her voice shakes.
- **Key Event:** "Negative," Angelica says. Her voice is flat. The Captain's Voice. "The servo is mechanical. It's physically jammed. The software can't talk to it because the line is cut."
- **Key Event:** Torin crosses his arms. He looks at the hologram, then at the sealed hatch that leads to the Reactor Core. "We have to go inside."

### Scene 3: The Calculation / The Bridge

- **Key Event:** The silence that follows is heavier than the G-force.
- **Key Event:** The Reactor Core. Even with the shielding, it's a star in a bottle. To go inside while the engine is running... it's suicide. The radiation levels aren't just lethal; they are instant. It's not about getting cancer in ten years. It's about your DNA unzipping before you can take a second breath.
- **Key Event:** Angelica does the math. She always does the math.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** Distance to servo: 15 meters. Sprint speed: 4 meters per second. Manual crank time: 10 seconds. Return trip: 15 meters. Total exposure time: ~20 seconds.
- **Key Event:** Survival probability: 0%.
- **Key Event:** But if they don't do it, the ship explodes, and the _Zenith_—light-years away and twenty years in the past—burns. Everyone she loves dies. The future dies.
- **Key Event:** The math is simple. One life for a billion.
- **Key Event:** She looks at her crew. Starla, young and terrified. The comms officer, gripping his rosary. Torin... looking at the hatch with a focused, builder’s intensity.
- **Key Event:** She built this ship. It's her design. Her flaw. Her responsibility.

### Scene 4: The Decision / The Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica stands up. The motion draws every eye.
- **Key Event:** She walks to the locker and grabs the heavy lead-lined gloves. "Torin, take the helm. Keep the localized gravity stable. If I trip in there, I'm ash."
- **Key Event:** Torin turns. "Angelica. No."
- **Key Event:** "I'm the Captain," she snaps. It's harsher than she intended. "It's my job. I know the schematic. I know the torque ratio for the manual override. You'd strip the gear."
- **Key Event:** It's a lie. Torin built the servo. He knows it better than she does. But she can't let him do this.
- **Key Event:** She pulls the gloves on. They are heavy, stiff. "Starla, once I clear the jam, vent the manifold. Don't wait for my signal. Just do it."
- **Key Event:** "But... the radiation..." Starla whispers. "The vent will flood the chamber."
- **Key Event:** "I know," Angelica says softly. "Just do it."

### Scene 5: The Silence / The Airlock

- **Key Event:** Angelica walks to the heavy blast door of the Reactor Antechamber.
- **Key Event:** She punches the code. _1-9-9-9_. Her birth year.
- **Key Event:** The door hisses. A warning light spins above it. **RADIATION HAZARD. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.**
- **Key Event:** She stops. She looks back.
- **Key Event:** The bridge is silent. The only sound is the rhythmic _thump-thump_ of the failing engine. It sounds like a dying heart.
- **Key Event:** Torin hasn't moved to the helm. He is standing in the middle of the deck, watching her. His face is unreadable. He isn't arguing anymore. He isn't shouting.
- **Key Event:** That scares her more than the yelling.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She wants to say something profound. _I love you._ _I'm sorry._ _It was worth it._ But the words stick in her throat. She is the Architect. She doesn't make speeches; she solves problems. And this is the final problem.
- **Key Event:** She steps into the airlock.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She accepts responsibility for her design and prepares to die for her crew. She is no longer the child running from Vane; she is the leader standing between her people and the dark.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'll do it. ... Torin, take the helm."
