# Chapter 20: The Cave

The safe zone in Sector 6 wasn't a cave in the natural sense. It was a hollowed-out section of a massive, disused gear housing from the First Era of the Foundry. The walls were curved, made of pitted bronze and iron, and the ceiling was a mesh of solidified cables that hung like vines in a metal jungle.

It smelled of grease, ancient dust, and the faint, copper tang of dried blood.

"Down," Ria grunted, dropping Kaelen's legs onto the metal floor. "Heavy for a bird-man."

She didn't mean it as an insult. Her voice was thick with exhaustion. They had marched for three hours through the labyrinth of the Sub-Levels to get here, carrying the dead weight of the Night scion between them.

Kaelen didn't groan. He didn't move. He lay exactly where he fell, his limbs arranged in the loose, unnatural sprawl of a marionette with cut strings.

Angelica dropped her pack and collapsed against the curved wall. Her breath hitched in her throat, rattling in her chest.

"Secure the entrance," she wheezed. "Ria. The blast door."

"Already on it," Ria cycled the manual lock on the heavy bulkhead. _CLANG._ The sound echoed in the hollow space like a gunshot. "We're sealed. Nothing getting in without a plasma cutter."

She turned back to Angelica.

"Angel?"

Angelica was clutching her wrist. The Blood Pact scar—the intricate, jagged mark that bound her life force to the squad—was glowing. Not the soft, pulsing amber of connection, but a violent, searing red.

It was burning her. It felt like someone had wrapped a wire of heated tungsten around her radius.

"He's fading," Angelica gasped, looking at Kaelen. "The solvent... it wasn't enough."

Ria knelt beside Kaelen. She touched his chest plate, then pulled off his helmet entirely.

Kaelen's face was a mask of grey ash. The black veins, which had receded in the Slag-Heaps, were back. And they were angry. They pulsed with a sick, violet light, throbbing against his skin like worms beneath the surface.

"His chest isn't moving," Ria said. Her voice was quiet. "Angel... he's stopped breathing."

"No," Angelica forced herself up. Her legs trembled, but she pushed off the wall. "He doesn't get to quit. Not yet."

She crawled over to him. She didn't check for a pulse; she knew there wasn't one. The Pact was screaming in her mind, a high-pitched whine of _DISCONNECTION IMMINENT._

"Give me the med-kit," Angelica ordered.

"We used the solvent," Ria said, handing her the pouch. "We're out of chem-stims."

"I don't need stims," Angelica grabbed her combat knife. "I need to see the hardware."

She didn't unclasp his armor; there wasn't time. She used the serrated edge of the blade to cut through the synthetic weave of his undersuit, ripping the fabric away from his neck and chest.

The smell hit them instantly.

It wasn't the smell of infection. It was the smell of ozone and rotting fruit.

The entry wound on his neck—the crater where the dart had hit—was bubbling. The black sludge wasn't just in his veins; it was eating the meat. It was dissolving the cellular structure, turning muscle and skin into a chaotic, grey slurry.

"It's growing," Ria recoiled. "It's eating him."

"It's Prima-Materia," Angelica said, her hands shaking as she lit a chemical flare from her survival kit. "Raw magic. It's rewriting his biology."

"What are you doing?" Ria asked as Angelica held the knife blade over the flare. The steel turned cherry-red in seconds.

"Cauterizing the source," Angelica said. "If I seal the breach, maybe the system can reboot."

She didn't hesitate. She pressed the glowing steel into the bubbling crater on Kaelen's neck.

_HISS._

Smoke billowed up, thick and white. The smell of burning flesh filled the small chamber.

Kaelen's body arched off the floor. His eyes snapped open, but they were rolled back, showing only the whites. A guttural sound tore from his throat—a sound of pure, animalistic agony.

"Hold him!" Angelica yelled, keeping the pressure on.

Ria pinned his shoulders, putting her full weight on him. "I got him! Do it!"

Angelica held the blade there for five seconds. Ten. Until the heat dissipated and the flesh was a charred, black ruin.

"Clear," she tossed the knife aside.

They watched the wound.

For a second, it looked sealed. The bubbling stopped.

Then, the black scab cracked.

Green light spilled out. The necrotic tissue didn't just return; it surged. It knit itself back together like living tar, faster than before, undoing the burn. The black veins shot out, racing down his chest, towards his heart.

"It... it healed itself," Ria whispered, horrified.

"No," Angelica sat back, wiping soot and sweat from her forehead. "It didn't heal. It reset."

She looked at Kaelen. He was convulsing now, tiny tremors racking his frame.

"Mother..." he mumbled, his voice a delirious slur. "Did I... break it? Am I... functional?"

"It's not working," Angelica realized. "It's in the blood. Fire doesn't stop it. Chemistry doesn't stop it."

She looked at her hands. They were stained with his blood and the black sludge.

"I'm treating him like a machine," she whispered. "Like a broken engine. But he's not an engine."

"He's a Highborn," Ria said. "They're made of magic, Angel. You can't fix magic with a knife."

"Magic is just code," Angelica said. The thought hit her like a physical blow. "It's software. Biology is just the hardware casing. The body isn't the problem. The code is corrupted."

She looked at Kaelen's chest. At the heart underneath the black veins.

"The solvent flushed the hardware," she said, her eyes widening. "But the virus is still in the software. It's in his soul."

"His soul?" Ria looked at her like she was crazy. "You can't fix a soul, Angel. That's... that's priest stuff. That's Void stuff."

"I'm an engineer," Angelica snapped. "I fix systems. And a soul is just a system."

She moved, straddling Kaelen's chest. She placed her hands directly over his heart, ignoring the black veins that tried to coil around her fingers like snakes.

"What are you doing?" Ria stood up, reaching for her. "Angel, don't. If that stuff touches you—"

"Watch the door, Ria," Angelica commanded. Her voice had changed. It wasn't the scared girl anymore. It was the mechanic. The one who spoke to machines. "Don't let anything in. Not even the ghosts."

"Angel—"

"DO IT!"

Ria flinched, then stepped back. She drew her weapon and turned to the door, her back to them.

"If you die," Ria warned, her voice shaking, "I'm going to kill you."

Angelica ignored her. She closed her eyes.

She didn't look at Kaelen. She didn't feel the cold metal of his armor or the heat of his fever.

She reached for the _Resonance_.

Usually, Resonance was external. It was the hum of a generator, the vibration of a hull. It was the song of metal.

But humans had a song too. It was quieter, messier, full of static and wet biological noise.

She pushed past the noise. She pushed past the fear.

She found the signal.

It was faint, buried under layers of screaming interference. It was a cold, rhythmic pulse. Like a metronome made of ice.

_Click. Click. Click._

Kaelen.

She pushed her empathy into him. It wasn't a gentle touch. It was a breach. An invasion.

_Access Request: Denied._

A wall slammed into her mind. It was made of iron and shadow. It was slippery, cold, and impenetrable. Kaelen's mental shields. Even dying, he was locked down.

"Let me in, you stubborn prince!" Angelica gritted her teeth. The nosebleed started again, a warm trickle over her lip. "Open the door!"

_Access Denied. Authorization Required._

She couldn't break it. He was House Night. His mind was a fortress.

But she had a key.

She looked at her wrist. At the Blood Pact scar.

It was a connection. A backdoor. He had accepted it. He had sworn the oath.

_Blood for Blood. Iron for Iron._

"Override," Angelica whispered.

She shoved her Resonance _through_ the scar. She used the pain as a carrier wave. She poured her own life force, her own burning, chaotic anger, into the bond.

_Authorization: SQUAD MEMBER. DESIGNATION: IRON._

The wall shuddered.

It cracked.

And then, Angelica fell.

---

She wasn't in the cave anymore.

She was standing in a hallway. The floor was polished black marble, stretching out to infinity in both directions. The walls were lined with mirrors, tall and gothic, framed in cold iron. But the mirrors didn't show reflections. They showed memories.

It was cold. So cold it burned. The air smelled of sterile dust and old parchment.

"Kaelen?" she called out.

Her voice didn't echo. The silence swallowed it instantly.

She walked. The sound of her boots on the marble was sharp, like a chisel hitting stone.

She looked into the first mirror.

_Memory: Age 6._
_A boy standing in the rain. He is holding a dead bird. He is not crying. He is dissecting it with a small knife, trying to find the mechanism that made it fly._
_Voice of Lord Night: "Understanding is control. Emotion is variables."_

She looked into the second mirror.

_Memory: Age 12._
_The Obsidian Hall. Three other boys—his brothers—are standing in a line. Kaelen is the smallest. Lord Night hands a sword to the eldest._
_Lord Night: "There is only one chair. The others are redundant."_

Angelica looked away. It was a gallery of trauma, curated with terrifying precision.

"He didn't repress it," she whispered. "He filed it."

This was his mind. This was the architecture of his soul.

It was beautiful. And it was terrible.

There was no furniture. No comfort. No chaos. Everything was straight lines and sharp angles. It was a place designed for one thing: Efficiency.

But something was wrong with the architecture.

The marble was cracking. Green slime was seeping up through the floorboards. The mirrors were fracturing, leaking violet light.

_The Corruption._

Angelica kept walking. The hallway began to twist. The geometry became non-Euclidean. The walls breathed.

She heard a sound. A wet, tearing noise. Like meat being pulled from bone.

She turned a corner and stopped.

The hallway ended. In front of her was a massive library. Rows of shelves reached up into a vaulted darkness. But the books weren't paper; they were crystals. Data shards.

And in the center of the room, something was eating the library.

It was a shapeless, roiling mass of green light and black sludge. It looked like oil mixed with battery acid. It had too many limbs—tendrils that whipped out, grabbed a crystal shard, and crushed it.

_CRUNCH._

The shard shattered. The memory inside—a graduation ceremony, Kaelen receiving his cloak—dissolved into static.

"Hey!" Angelica yelled.

The thing stopped. It turned. It didn't have a face, but it had a mouth. A jagged tear in the reality of the mindscape.

**"USER: UNAUTHORIZED,"** the thing roared. The voice sounded like Kaelen's, but stripped of all humanity. It was the voice of the Poison. **"DETECTING FOREIGN VARIABLE. QUARANTINE INITIATED."**

A wall of green fire erupted from the floor, blocking Angelica's path.

"I'm not a variable," Angelica stepped forward. She visualized her suit. Her tools. In this world, belief was reality. A heavy wrench materialized in her hand. "I'm the admin."

She swung the wrench at the fire wall.

_SMASH._

The fire shattered like glass.

The Corruption shrieked. It lashed out with a tendril of sludge.

Angelica didn't dodge. She visualized a shield. Not a physical one, but a conceptual one. A firewall.

_ACCESS_DENIED._

The shield shimmered into existence—a hexagonal grid of golden light. Calculations and runes spun across its surface.

The sludge hit the shield and sizzled.

**"ERROR,"** the Corruption bellowed. **"LOGIC CONTRADICTION. FLESH CANNOT CODE."**

"Watch me," Angelica gritted her teeth.

She charged.

She ran through the library, dodging falling shelves. The Corruption was fast, but it was mindless. It was a virus. It followed a script. _Destroy. Consume. Repeat._

Angelica was an engineer. She improvised.

She leaped off a toppling shelf, raising the wrench. The wrench glowed. It became a Warhammer of pure white light.

"Get out of his head!" she screamed.

She slammed the hammer into the center of the mass.

_BOOM._

The impact sent a shockwave through the mindscape. The library shook. The crystals sang.

The Corruption exploded into a spray of code and slime. But it didn't die. It reformed. It coalesced into a sphere of spiked iron, rolling towards her.

"Persistent little bug," Angelica muttered.

She needed to find the Core. The CPU. The place where Kaelen _was_.

She looked past the monster. Behind the library, there was a door. A small, wooden door. It looked out of place in this cathedral of obsidian and glass.

"That's it," she realized. "The safe room."

She turned and ran for the door.

**"DELETION IMMINENT,"** the Corruption roared, rolling after her.

It was gaining. The floor was dissolving behind her, turning into a void of green static.

Angelica reached the door. It was locked.

"Open up!" she pounded on it. "Kaelen!"

No answer.

The Corruption was ten feet away. Five.

"Fine," Angelica stepped back. "We do it the hard way."

She placed her hand on the lock. She didn't pick it. She used the Blood Pact.

_Authorization: IRON._

The lock didn't click. It melted.

She kicked the door open and dove inside, slamming it shut just as the green wave crashed against it.

...

The noise stopped.

She was in a small room. It wasn't obsidian. It was wood. Warm, polished oak. There was a fireplace crackling with a small fire. There was a rug.

And in the center of the rug, a boy was kneeling.

He wasn't the armored warrior she knew. He was a child. Maybe ten years old. He was wearing a white training tunic soaked in blood. He was holding his left arm, which hung at a sickening angle.

He was staring at the floor, repeating a mantra.

"Effective. Efficient. Empty."

"Kaelen!" Angelica ran towards him.

The boy looked up. His eyes were entirely black. No whites. Just voids.

"I cannot," he whispered. "I am deleted."

"You aren't deleted," Angelica grabbed his shoulders. "You're crashing. There's a difference."

"Pain is data," the boy recited. "I have... too much data. Buffer overflow."

"Then dump the buffer!" Angelica shook him. "Kaelen, listen to me. This isn't you. This is the poison. It's a logic loop. It's telling you to die."

"Highborn do not break," the boy wept. Black tears ran down his face. "But I am broken. Look."

He held up his chest.

There was a hole where his heart should be. And inside the hole, the green code was chewing on the gears of his existence.

Angelica looked at it.

She understood.

The Prima-Materia attacked the _will_. It attacked the identity. It found the crack in the armor—his fear of failure, his fear of his father—and it pried it open until there was nothing left.

"You aren't broken," Angelica said softly. "You're just... glitching."

She put her hand into the hole in his chest.

The cold was absolute. She felt his despair. She felt the crushing weight of his loneliness—a solitude so profound it made her want to weep.

But she also felt... her.

She felt the spark of the Blood Pact. It was a tiny, golden thread woven into the darkness.

And through that thread, Kaelen felt her.

He felt her heat. Her messy, loud, chaotic warmth. He felt her pride—not the cold pride of a noble, but the burning pride of a creator. He felt her love for her brother. Her fear. Her hope.

It shocked him.

The boy gasped. The black eyes flickered. Violet light returned to the irises.

"You..." he whispered. "You are... loud."

"Yeah, I get that a lot," Angelica smiled.

She grabbed the green code. It burned her mental hand, stinging like acid.

"This doesn't belong here," she said.

She didn't fight it. You don't fight a virus. You purge it.

She visualized a command line. A simple, brutal directive.

**SELECT ALL > TARGET: PRIMA_MATERIA**
**ACTION: DELETE**

She screamed the command. Not with her voice, but with her will.

_DELETE!_

The world went white.

---

**The Vigil: Sector 6 Cave**

Ria stood by the blast door, her repeater trained on the shadow.

Something was out there.

She could hear it. A scratching sound. Metallic claws on metal plating.

_Skitter. Skitter._

"Scavengers," she muttered. "Probably Rust-Mites. They smell the blood."

She glanced back at Angelica and Kaelen. They were frozen. Angelica was straddling Kaelen's chest, her eyes closed, her body rigid. Kaelen was motionless, his face pale as death.

"Don't wake up," Ria whispered to them. "I got this."

She turned back to the door. The scratching was getting louder. It was coming from the ventilation shaft above the bulkhead. The vent was small, but big enough for a crawler.

A grate fell with a clang.

A dark shape dropped onto the floor.

It was a Rust-Mite. A cybernetic insect the size of a dog, built from scrap metal and wire. Its mandibles were hydraulic cutters. Its eyes were glowing red sensors.

It chittered, locking onto Ria.

Then another dropped. And another.

Five of them. A swarm.

Ria didn't shoot. The noise would echo in the small space. It might break Angelica's concentration. The resonance feedback could fry her brain if she was pulled out too fast.

She slung the repeater. She drew her combat knife in her left hand and activated the power-cestus on her right gauntlet.

"Come on then, bug-boys," she grinned, though the sweat on her brow was cold. "Let's dance quietly."

The first mite lunged.

Ria sidestepped. She was big, but she moved with the practiced grace of a brawler. She caught the mite in mid-air with her left hand, grabbing its carapace.

_CRUNCH._

She drove the knife into its sensor array. The light went out. She tossed the carcass aside.

The second one tried to flank her. It scurried along the wall, aiming for Angelica.

"Oh no you don't," Ria growled.

She punched the wall.

The power-cestus discharged with a muffled _THUMP_. The magnetics in the gauntlet reversed polarity for a split second, repelling the iron hull. The impact dented the plating and sent a shockwave through the metal skin of the cave. The mite lost its grip and fell.

Ria stomped on it before it could recover. _SQUELCH._ Hydraulic fluid sprayed across her boots.

But the others were moving. One jumped onto her back, its mandibles digging into her shoulder pauldron. She felt the metal tearing.

"Get off!" She grabbed it, ripping it free with a grunt of effort, tearing her own armor in the process. She slammed it into the floor.

The fourth and fifth were scuttling past her. They were heading straight for Kaelen and Angelica.

"NO!"

Ria dove. She didn't tackle them; she threw herself in their path. She became a wall.

The mites hit her. Mandibles tried to cut her suit. Claws scratched at her visor.

She grabbed them both. One in each hand.

"Squeeze," she hissed.

She activated the crush-servos in her gauntlets.

_CRACK. CRACK._

The mites imploded, leaking sparking fluid and oil.

Ria stood up, breathing hard. Her armor was scratched, leaking coolant from the shoulder. But she was standing.

She kicked the carcasses into the corner.

"Clear," she whispered. "Nobody touches the family. Nobody."

She looked back at the pair on the floor.

Angelica gasped.

---

**The White Room**

Kaelen didn't know where he was.

He was floating in a white void. There was no pain. No noise. No data.

It was peaceful.

_This is deletion,_ he thought. _It is acceptable._

He felt light. The weight of the House, the weight of the name, the weight of the Iron... it was all gone. He dissolved into the static.

But then, there was a snag.

Something was pulling him back.

It wasn't a command. It wasn't a duty. It was... a request.

_Don't die on me, Night._

The voice was annoying. It was loud. It was chaotic.

It was Angelica.

_I am deleted,_ he told the voice. _Let me go._

_I don't do resurrections on a budget,_ the voice argued. _Get up._

He felt a hand grabbing his soul. Not a hand of flesh, but a hand of will. It pulled him out of the white void. It dragged him back through the layers of consciousness. Back through the pain. Back through the cold.

He saw code raining down around him. Green code, shattering.

_DELETE._

He heard the command. It was a roar of absolute authority.

The green code vanished.

In its place, he saw gold. A golden thread, woven through the darkness of his own mind. It was stitching him back together.

_Patching... 10%... 50%... 100%._
_System Reboot._

He opened his eyes.

---

**The Reboot**

Angelica slammed back onto the metal floor of the cave.

"Angel!" Ria was there, catching her head before it hit the plating.

Angelica couldn't breathe. Her chest felt like it had been hit with a hammer. She rolled over, coughing violently. Blood splattered on the metal.

"Did it work?" Ria yelled. "Is he dead?"

"Check... check the monitor," Angelica wheezed.

They looked at Kaelen.

He was still lying there. But the convulsions had stopped.

The black veins on his chest were fading. Rapidly. They turned from black to grey, then to faint white lines, and then... nothing.

The bubbling crater on his neck had turned into a clean, pink scar.

Kaelen took a deep, shuddering breath.

His eyes snapped open.

They were clear. Violet. Sharp.

He sat up. It wasn't a groggy awakening. He sat up with the sudden, hydraulic snap of a machine coming online.

He looked at his hands. He looked at the cave. Then he looked at Angelica.

He knew.

He touched his chest.

"You... were inside," he said. His voice was hoarse, but steady.

"I deleted the corruption," Angelica wiped the blood from her mouth. "It was a logic loop. I terminated the process."

Kaelen stared at her. For the first time, looked... unsettled.

"You saw," he whispered. "You saw the Obsidian Hall."

"I saw a hallway," Angelica shrugged, trying to act casual despite the trembling in her hands. "And a library. You read a lot of books for a guy who stabs things for a living."

Kaelen looked away. A muscle in his jaw jumped.

"My shields..."

"Are impressive," Angelica admitted. "But your firewall has holes. Specifically, the emotional ports. You need a patch."

Kaelen was silent for a long time. He flexed his left arm—the one that had been broken in the vision.

"You saved me," he said. It wasn't a question.

"I fixed you," Angelica corrected. "Different thing. Saving is for heroes. Fixing is for mechanics."

"Semantics," Kaelen stood up. He wobbled slightly, but Ria didn't reach out to steady him. She knew better. He steadied himself against the wall.

He looked at Angelica.

"You said my heartbeat was... 'annoying'. A primitive rhythm."

Angelica smirked weakly. "It was too slow. Efficient, but boring."

"I will endeavor to accelerate it," Kaelen said dryly.

"Don't die on me again, Night," she closed her eyes, leaning her head back against Ria's shoulder. "I don't do resurrections on a budget. That cost me a lot of calories."

"Understood, Ward," Kaelen said. He picked up his helmet, checking the seals. "Your bill is noted. Processing payment options."

Ria looked between them. She shook her head.

"You two are weird," she grunted. "Stop flirting and eat a protein bar. You both look like corpses."

---

**The Echo**

While Ria checked her armor and Kaelen ran diagnostics on his suit, Angelica sat by the small chemical heater.

Aeon fluttered down from the shadows and landed on her knee.

The owl looked different. His brass feathers were duller, as if oxidized. His blue eye-lenses were flickering.

"Hey, buddy," Angelica whispered, stroking his metal head. "You okay?"

Aeon chirped. It was a low, static-filled sound.

_Data Load: Heavy. Correlation: Unknown._

"What did you eat?" she asked.

Aeon opened his beak. He didn't vomit a pellet this time. Instead, he projected a small hologram.

It was fuzzy, low-resolution. It showed Kaelen's heart. But over it, superimposed like a ghost, was a symbol.

A gear. But not a gear of the Foundry. A gear made of bone.

"The Necro-Tech," Angelica frowned. "I saw that in the dream. The Machine God."

_Query: Designation?_ Aeon asked.

"I don't know," Angelica whispered. "But the poison... the Prima-Materia... it wasn't just magic. It was a key. Someone was trying to unlock him."

She looked at Kaelen, who was tirelessly cleaning his blades in the corner.

"He's not just a Highborn," she realized. "He's a component. And someone is trying to salvage him."

Aeon closed his beak. The hologram vanished.

_Warning: Observer Detected._

Angelica stiffened. "Where?"

_Above. Always above._

Angelica looked up at the curved metal ceiling. She couldn't see anything but rust and cables. But she felt it. The weight of eyes. The weight of the Selection.

"Let them watch," she touched the scar on her wrist. "They'll see something interesting soon enough."

---

**The Zenith: Observation Deck Alpha**

Far above the rust and the rot, the air was sweet.

The Emperor stood on the balcony of the Observation Deck, looking down at the projected map of the Foundry. The map was a living hologram, filled with thousands of tiny dots representing the candidates.

Most of the dots were dimming.

But in Sector 6, three dots burned with a steady, gold light.

"Interesting," the Emperor murmured. His voice was like grinding stones. He wore the Golden Mask of the Sovereign, a relic that hid his face and projected his voice directly into the minds of his subjects.

Behind him, Lord Cromwell—the Royal Actuary—was furiously typing on a floating holographic slate. Cromwell was a thin man, dry as dust, with a monocle fused to his left eye.

"The telemetry confirms it, Majesty," Cromwell said, his monocle flashing with scrolling data. "The Night heir was biologically terminated. Toxicity 100%. Then... rapid reversal."

"Not reversal, Cromwell," the Emperor turned. His robes, woven from gold thread and starlight, swished softly. "Revision."

"Sire?"

"The Silt-rat," the Emperor pointed to the dot labeled _A. Ward_. "She didn't heal him. Healing follows the laws of entropy. She bypassed the laws. She soul-linked without formal training. Without a medium. Without a priest."

Cromwell stopped typing. He looked up, his face pale.

"That is... theoretically impossible for a Commoner. Unless..."

"Unless she is not common," the Emperor finished. "Or unless the Void has a sense of humor."

"Should I order an extraction? An interrogation?"

"No," The Emperor raised a hand. "Let them play. The gears are turning, Cromwell. For the first time in a century, the gears are actually turning. I want to see what they grind."

In the shadowed alcove near the wine bar, a figure shifted.

Lady Corinne—The Porcelain Doll—sipped her nectar. She had been listening. She had been watching the same feed on her private monocle.

She wore a dress of spun glass that refracted the light, making her look like a diamond statue. Her face was painted white, her lips a slash of blood red.

"A debt," she whispered to herself. A smile curled her painted lips. "A life-debt between the Wards and the Nights."

The Night House was powerful. Frozen in their ways, ancient, and untouchable. They owed nothing to anyone.

But now, their heir owed his life to a piece of slum trash.

"How deliciously exploitable," Corinne swirled her glass.

She pulled up a betting slip on her datapad.

_Wager: Squad Iron to reach the Core._
_Odds: 100 to 1._

She tapped the screen.

_Max Bet._

She glanced at the other high-borns in the room. They were betting on Squad Gold. Squad Silver. The favorites. They didn't see what she saw.

They saw a mechanic. Corinne saw a wrench in the gears.

"Go on, little mechanical mouse," she toasted the hologram. "Build me a fortune."

***

**The Betting Floor: Zenith Level 1**

The Betting Floor was a shark tank wrapped in velvet.

It was a sprawling rotunda of glass and gold, suspended beneath the Observation Deck. Here, the High Houses didn't watch the Selection for strategic data; they watched it for sport.

Lady Corinne drifted through the crowd like a cloud of diamond dust. Her dress, woven from spun glass and optical fiber, refracted the ambient light, making it difficult to look at her directly. That was the point. Corinne did not like being seen; she liked being admired.

"Corinne," a voice dripped with oil. "Still wearing transparency? Bold choice for a woman with so many secrets."

She turned.

Lord Silver stood there. He was tall, chrome-plated from the neck down, and held a glass of blue nectar. His family sponsored Squad Silverthe squad Kaelen had dismantled in the Slag-Heaps.

"Lord Silver," Corinne smiled. It was a weaponized smile. "I heard about your loss. Sector 4. Three operatives against one exhausted Shadow. And they still lost."

Silver's jaw tightened. "A fluke. The Shadow used illegal tactics. He targeted joints. It was... ungentlemanly."

"It was efficient," Corinne corrected. "But then, House Silver has always preferred polish over performance."

She tapped her datapad.

"I see you've moved your wager to Squad Gold," she noted. "Hedging your bets? How... pedestrian."

"Squad Gold is a certainty," Silver sneered. "They are vat-grown perfection. They have not taken a single scratch. Meanwhile, your... investment... looks like it was chewed on by a ghoul."

He gestured to the main screen, where a grainy feed showed Squad Iron in the cave. Kaelen looked pale. Angelica was covered in blood. Ria's armor was dented.

"They are broken, Corinne," Silver laughed. "The boy is poison-sick. The mechanic is exhausted. The brute is leaking hydraulic fluid. They won't last the night."

"They survived the night," Corinne said softly. "Which is more than your squad did."

"Survival is not victory," Silver leaned in. "I am doubling my wager on Gold. And I am placing a side-bet. 50,000 Credits."

"On what?"

"Time of death," Silver grinned. "I bet Squad Iron terminates before reaching Sector 7."

The room went quiet. A side-bet between High Lords was rare. It was blood sport.

Corinne looked at the screen. She saw the way Kaelen stoodwobbly, but standing. She saw the way Angelica looked at the camera, as if she knew they were watching.

She saw the spark.

"Make it 100,000," Corinne said loud enough for the Emperor to hear on the balcony above.

Silver blinked. "One hundred thousand? You'll bankrupt your liquidity."

"I have excellent credit," Corinne turned to the actuary drone hovering nearby. "Log the wager. Corinne vs Silver. 100,000 Credits."

"Condition?" the drone beeped.

"Condition: Squad Iron reaches the Core," Corinne said.

"The Core?" Silver laughed out loud. "That's impossible! No slum-squad has ever reached the Core!"

"Then the odds should be favorable," Corinne arched an eyebrow.

"1000 to 1," the drone calculated.

"Accepted," Silver practically shouted. "I accept! You're mad, Corinne. You're throwing away a fortune on trash."

"We shall see," Corinne turned back to the window.

She watched the hologram.

*Don't disappoint me, little mouse,* she thought. *I just bet my entire estate on your ability to fix broken things.*

The crowd buzzed. The odds board flashed.

*SQUAD IRON: ODDS ADJUSTED.*

For the first time in the history of the Selection, the slum squad wasn't the lowest ranked. They were the Wild Card.

And in the Zenith, the Wild Card was the most dangerous card in the deck.

*"The soul is not a communal resource. It is a closed system. The boundaries of the self are the walls of the citadel. To breach these wallseven with the intent to healis to commit the Sin of Permeability.*

*In the First Era, the Flesh-Weavers attempted to link minds. They sought to create a hive of perfect understanding. They believed that if pain was shared, it would be halved. They believed that if knowledge was shared, it would be doubled.*

*They were wrong.*

*Pain, when shared, does not dilute; it resonates. It creates a feedback loop of agony that shatters the vessel. And knowledge, when poured directly from one mind to another without the filter of language, burns the receiver to ash.*

*To look into another's soul is to look into the Void. It is to see the raw, unedited code of existence. The human mind is not designed to process this code. It is designed to see the interface, not the operating system.*

*Therefore, let it be written: The Wall of the Self is sacred. No interference. No telepathy. No resonance.*

*He who opens the door to another's mind invites the Draft. And the Draft will extinguish the flame of both."*

**Commentary by Lord Cromwell (Royal Actuary):**
*The Ward girl did not just open the door. She kicked it down. And yet, the flame did not go out. It grew. This suggests that the First Artificer's data set was... incomplete.*
