# Character Profile: Router

**Archetype:** The Guardian / The Mute Wall
**True Sin:** SLOTH (He has surrendered his voice and agency to become the physical anchor for another's obsession).
**Virtue Mask:** PROTECTION (He frames his growling and guarding as "System Security").

## I. Role in the Story

Router is a massive, silent man who carries Lisbet’s server racks. He is the physical presence that anchors Lisbet's digital life to the real world.

- **The Bond:** He shares a quiet, physical bond with Lisbet—passing her drinks, adjusting her cables—that implies a level of intimacy and trust Angelica has never experienced with her.
- **The Hostility:** He growls at Angelica if she gets too close to the hardware, signaling that she is a "system error" that needs to be kept away from the server.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Physical Localization / Capture. **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 7 (The Nest). Router is physically captured by the Praetorian Guard after his physical location is leaked. He is subjected to "interfacing interrogation," where his mind is forcibly mapped by the Zenith's AIs.
  **Quote:** _[Silence]_
- **Impact on Lisbet:** Lisbet is forced to wipe Router’s localized memory bank to protect the Underground’s secrets, effectively lobotomizing her friend from a distance. This cold, tactical "execution" shatters the Underground’s trust in her leadership.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Pathfinder" is gone. The Underground becomes blind and isolated, forced to use slower, riskier methods of communication that make them even more vulnerable to the Zenith’s surveillance.
