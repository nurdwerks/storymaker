## Chapter 24: The Interface

### Scene 1: The Throne Room

- **Key Event:** The blast doors to the Interface Throne open for the first time in centuries. The room is circular, dominated by the Throne itself—a complex apparatus of chrome, leather, and hundreds of fiber-optic cables that hang like willow branches.
- **Detailed Description:** The air in the room is sterile, smelling of copper and ozone. The Throne is elevated on a dais. It does not look comfortable. It looks like a medical restraint system. The "crown" is a halo of neural spikes suspended above the headrest. The armrests are equipped with intravenous ports to feed the pilot nutrients and stimulants, acknowledging that once seated, the pilot is not expected to leave.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica walks toward it, her boots clicking on the metal floor. She feels a sense of horror mixed with recognition. The design of the chair matches the nightmares she has had since childhood. She realizes that her "destiny" was never about ruling; it was about this mechanical enslavement.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Realizes that her entire bloodline was engineered by the Founders to be "components" or "biological hardware" rather than true rulers. She touches the cold metal of the interface port.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's not a throne. It's a socket. It's a battery slot."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are hardware, my dear. Beautiful, biological hardware. You are the key. The ship has a body, but it needs a soul to scream at the void."

- **Key Event:** Vane activates the diagnostic display. It shows the neural load required to pilot the Star-Tear Drive. The graph spikes into the red, levels that would cause a normal human brain to seize and liquefy.
- **Detailed Description:** The hologram shows a simulation of a brain under load. The synapses fire so rapidly they burn out. Vane explains, with clinical detachment, that the pilot must process terabytes of navigational data in real-time. The "Sangreal" gene—Angelica's mutation—allows her neurons to act as superconductors, handling the surge without melting. But the cost is permanent integration. The brain rewires itself to the ship's architecture.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ironwood steps forward, his mechanical eye whirling. He sees the danger to Angelica. He offers himself. He argues that his cybernetic augments might handle the load. He is willing to die to save the "civilian."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Volunteers to take the throne instead, but is rejected by Vane because he lacks the "imagination" and "resonance" of the Sangreal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "I'll do it. I'm already half machine. Plug me in. Let me die doing something useful."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are a hammer, Ironwood. We need a scalpel. Your brain is scarred by war; the drive requires the flexibility of youth and the specific resonance of her blood."

### Scene 2: The Preparation

- **Key Event:** Angelica accepts the burden. She orders everyone but Vane and Kaelen to leave the room.
- **Detailed Description:** The crew filters out, casting worried glances back at their Captain. Ria lingers, looking at the chair with hatred, but Angelica nods to her, dismissing her. The door closes. Angelica begins to strip off her outer armor, revealing the flight suit beneath. Her hands are steady.
- **Internal Conflict:** She is terrified. She is mourning the life she will never have—the quiet life she dreamed of with Kaelen. But she pushes those thoughts into a mental box. She needs to be clear.

- **Key Event:** Vane prepares the "Crown." He cleans the needles with an alcohol wipe. The smell is sharp and stinging.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane's movements are almost ritualistic. He is the high priest of this technological sacrifice. He hums a low, discordant tune. He explains the procedure: the needles will pierce the skull at specific meridian points to tap into the visual and motor cortex.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen watches, his hand on his sword. He wants to kill Vane. He wants to smash the machine. But he stands still, honoring Angelica's choice. He is vibrating with suppressed rage and grief.

### Scene 3: The Last Human Moment

- **Key Event:** Before she sits, Angelica asks Vane a final question about her mother.
- **Detailed Description:** She stands by the chair. She asks if her mother, Elena, ever sat here. Vane pauses. He admits that Elena refused. She chose to die rather than become the ship. He looks at Angelica with a strange, twisted pride. "You are stronger than she was," he says.
- **Internal Conflict:** This revelation steels Angelica's resolve. She isn't just saving the ship; she is finishing what her mother couldn't. She sits down. The restraints clamp shut.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Do it. Before I change my mind."
