## Chapter 10: The Assessment

### Scene 1: The Crash Site (Interior View)

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Lisbet examine the "paintings" of the dead crew from a safe distance.
- **Detailed Description:** Standing behind a reinforced quartz-glass observation window, Angelica and Lisbet look into the sealed Sector 4 corridor. The area is bathed in the harsh, sterilizing light of decontamination lamps. On the far wall, the "mural" of the four maintenance workers remains pristine. The images are disturbing in their perfection. Every detail—the serial numbers on their suits, the terror in their eyes, the individual hairs on a knuckle—is preserved in absolute 2D. It is as if they were pressed between two panes of cosmic glass. Lisbet directs a drone to scan the surface.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica fights the urge to look away. She forces herself to study the death, knowing that understanding it is the only way to survive it. She feels a deep, empathetic sorrow, not just for the men, but for the indignity of their end. They weren't just killed; they were archived.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She places her hand on the glass, her reflection superimposed over the dead men. She realizes this weapon doesn't just destroy matter; it undoes the act of creation. It simplifies complexity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "It's not a weapon, Lisbet. A weapon breaks things. This... this is a formatting tool. They're trying to save space."

- **Key Event:** Lisbet analyzes the drone data.
- **Detailed Description:** The drone hovers millimeters from the wall. The readings scroll across Lisbet's datapad. "Z-Axis Depth: 0.0000. Mass: Conserved but planar. Biological function: Null." She confirms that the atoms have been rearranged onto a single geometric plane. There is no decay because bacteria cannot exist in 2D. The bodies will remain perfect, frozen images forever.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet, who usually finds comfort in data, is terrified by the "glitch" in reality. This violates the rules of the simulation she understands. It is a cheat code.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "It’s efficient. Horribly, perfectly efficient. 100% mass retention. 0% volume."

### Scene 2: The Briefing Room

- **Key Event:** The team gathers to discuss counter-measures. Kaelen proposes a Shadow Magic defense.
- **Detailed Description:** Back in the war room, Kaelen stands before the tactical display. He theorizes that since his shadows are inherently 2D (projections of light blocked by matter), they might be immune to the flattening effect. He proposes "coating" the hull in a shadow-shield, essentially camouflaging the ship's 3D nature.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen is unsure. He is guessing. He knows his magic is strong, but against physics-altering technology, it feels like fighting a tank with a poem. But he projects confidence for the sake of the crew.

- **Key Event:** Vane interrupts via the comms system.
- **Detailed Description:** Suddenly, the main screen overrides. Vane's face appears. He is in the Command Spire, bathed in the red light of the emergency systems. He looks disheveled, his eyes wide and manic. He has been watching the internal feeds of the "paintings." He begins to laugh—a dry, rattling sound. He calls the flattening "Beautiful." He praises the "purity" of the geometry.
- **Internal Conflict:** The crew watches in horror. Vane has cracked. The pressure of the Entity, combined with his own narcissism, has broken his tether to reality. He sees the destruction as a divine revelation.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "Do you see it? Look at the efficiency! No waste! No blood! It is the ultimate Order! We should be grateful to be corrected!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "He's gone. The madness has him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "It is not madness, Kaelen. It is envy. He wishes he had thought of it first."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I'm going to go up there and correct his face."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen orders the link cut.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen signals Lisbet. She types a kill-command, severing Vane's video feed. The screen goes black, then returns to the tactical map. The silence in the room is heavy. They realize they are fighting a war on two fronts: the Entity outside, and their leader's insanity inside.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Cut his line. He's mad. We ignore him from now on."

### Scene 3: The Armory

- **Key Event:** Ria prepares for a spacewalk.
- **Detailed Description:** In the armory, the air smells of gun oil and ozone. Ria stands in the assembly rig as robotic arms bolt the heavy "Titan" plates onto her chassis. She is not preparing for a standard patrol; she is preparing for a brawl. She instructs the tech to override the safety limiters on her servos. She wants maximum torque. If she is going to fight flat objects, she needs kinetic density. She loads her assault cannon with high-explosive rounds, though she doubts they will work.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria is angry. The "math" killed her men. She wants to hit something solid. The abstract nature of the threat frustrates her. She needs to turn this into a physical fight, something she can win.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She tests the weight of her massive shield. She feels grounded by the heavy metal. It is real. It is 3D. It is her anchor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I'm going out there. I'm going to punch that triangle until it remembers the third dimension. Or I'm going to break my hand trying."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen joins her.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen enters, wearing his void-suit. He nods to her. He will not let her go alone. The two of them—the Knight and the Tank—stand ready. It is a callback to their partnership in previous books, a silent acknowledgment that they are the sword and shield of the ship.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Watch my back, Iron Vanguard."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Always, Shadow Prince."

### Scene 4: The Old Guard

- **Key Event:** Veterans assess the situation.
- **Detailed Description:** **Hatcher (The Null)** appears in the armory doorway, his shotgun already loaded. He has heard the briefing through the intercom and made his own assessment—this fight needs experience, not just firepower. Behind him, **Zephyr (The Gilded Rogue)** runs diagnostics on his cybernetic arm, noting excessive drain from the ship's power fluctuations. His platinum eye scans the armory's inventory, calculating which equipment offers the best survival-to-cost ratio.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Geometry monsters. Perfect. Just when I thought I'd seen everything. I'm coming with you. Someone needs to keep you kids from getting flattened."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "My arm's draining faster than usual. The Entity's pulling power from everywhere. But I can still aim. Put me on overwatch."
