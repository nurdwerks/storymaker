## Chapter 07: The Panic

### Scene 1: The Mess Hall

- **Key Event:** The truth about the "Cease and Desist" message leaks to the general crew.
- **Detailed Description:** The rumors start as whispers in the food lines, then explode into shouts. Someone from the comms team talked—a junior tech overwhelmed by the burden of the secret. "The ship is being deleted." "Vane is lying." "The escape pods are offline." The Mess Hall, a cavernous space usually filled with the dull murmur of exhausted people, erupts into chaos. People shove each other, overturning heavy metal tables. Food trays clatter to the floor, spilling gray nutrient paste that makes the deck slick and treacherous. A stampede begins toward the main exit, people blindly running for the escape pods that they know, intellectually, are broken, but instinct drives them to try anyway. The air smells of fear-sweat, spilled food, and the metallic tang of adrenaline.
- **Internal Conflict:** The crew has reached their breaking point. After years of starvation, war with the Wardens, the "Stone Season," and drifting in the void, this final, silent threat is too much. The veneer of civilization cracks. Neighbors turn into rivals for the door. The collective trauma of the *Aeterna*'s journey manifests as blind, animal panic.

- **Key Event:** Lady Corinne takes command of the room.
- **Detailed Description:** Corinne, sitting at a corner table with Scrap and Old Man Rust, watches the chaos. She finishes her tea (which is mostly hot water), sets the cup down precisely, and stands up. She does not scream. She climbs onto the table, her heels clicking on the metal. She claps her hands sharply—once, twice. The sound cuts through the noise like a whip crack. She projects her voice with the training of a high-born socialite, using the acoustics of the room to her advantage.
- **Internal Conflict:** Corinne is terrified. She knows the rumors are likely true. But she refuses to show it. To her, panic is "vulgar." It is a loss of control, and she values control above all else. She channels her old persona—the Lady of the Court—to shame the mob into silence. It is a performance, but a necessary one.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — She stares down a large mechanic who is shoving a woman. Her gaze is so withering, so filled with aristocratic disdain, that he steps back, cowed by pure attitude. She straightens her dress, brushing off an invisible speck of dust.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Stop it! All of you! Panic ruins the complexion and solves nothing. Sit down. You are acting like animals, and I will not dine in a zoo. If we are to die, we will do so with dignity, not trampling each other like cattle."

### Scene 2: The Medical Bay

- **Key Event:** The injured from the stampede arrive at the Med Bay.
- **Detailed Description:** The doors slide open, admitting a stream of walking wounded. Broken noses, trampled hands, panic attacks, bruises from being crushed against bulkheads. Corinne, having quelled the riot in the Mess Hall, follows them here. She finds the medical staff overwhelmed. Dr. Hale is trying to intubate a patient while three others scream for attention. Corinne immediately takes charge, not as a doctor, but as an administrator. She directs nurses, organizes triage lines, and bullies people into calmness. She uses Scrap as an enforcer to keep the lines orderly.
- **Internal Conflict:** Corinne looks at the injuries. They are self-inflicted. The Sphere hasn't touched them; they did this to themselves. She feels a deep disgust for human frailty, the "messiness" of fear. But beneath the disgust is a strange protectiveness. They are *her* idiots. She will not let them die of stupidity.

- **Key Event:** Corinne treats a patient.
- **Detailed Description:** A young man is hyperventilating, screaming about the "flat men" and clawing at his own face. Corinne grabs his wrists. She slaps him across the face—sharp, stinging, efficient. The shock snaps him out of his hysteria. She then gently bandages his scraped hand, her touch surprisingly tender. The duality of the action—violence and care—defines her leadership style.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Panic is a luxury for the living. You are currently bleeding. Focus on that. Breathe. In. Out. Good boy. Now, go sit in the corner and be quiet."

### Scene 3: The Corridors

- **Key Event:** Zephyr is caught in the mob near the bulkheads.
- **Detailed Description:** In a narrow corridor connecting the residential decks to the shuttle bays, the crush of bodies is dangerous. A bulkhead door, triggered by the ship's automatic lockdown protocols, begins to close on the crowd. The heavy blast door descends slowly, grinding in its tracks. Zephyr, the "Gilded Rogue," is pushed against the wall. He sees a child—a girl no older than ten—tripping in the threshold. The door is seconds away from crushing her.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr is a self-proclaimed coward and opportunist. He checks his exit route. He could slip through a maintenance vent. He could save himself. He owes these people nothing. But he looks at the kid. He groans, cursing his own conscience. He hates being a hero; it doesn't pay well.

- **Key Event:** Zephyr uses his cybernetic arm to hold the door.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr dives forward. He jams his golden, cybernetic arm (a relic of the Golden Age) into the closing door mechanism. The servos whine in high-pitched protest. The weight of the door is immense—tons of steel designed to seal against vacuum. Metal grinds on metal. Sparks shower down on him, burning his coat. He braces his legs, his human arm trembling with the strain while his machine arm locks in place, the hydraulics screaming. He holds the gap open just wide enough for the people to squeeze through.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He grits his teeth, sweat dripping down his face. He masks his heroism with complaints about the cost of repairs. He refuses to let them see he cares.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Come on! Move it! This arm cost more than your life! That's a billable hour, kid. Don't forget it. You owe me! Everyone who passes this door owes me five credits!"

### Scene 4: The Clean Up

- **Key Event:** The robots begin cleaning the Mess Hall.
- **Detailed Description:** Hours later, the panic has subsided into a sullen dread. In the Mess Hall, service bots move silently, scrubbing the spilled food and blood from the floor. The smell of bleach overrides the smell of fear. Corinne sits alone at her table, watching them. The room is empty now, save for the machines.
- **Internal Conflict:** Corinne feels the exhaustion hit her. Her hands shake slightly as she lifts her tea cup. She realizes that order has been restored, but it is fragile. Vane's lies won't hold them forever. Next time, clapping her hands won't work.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Scrap, remind me to add 'Lion Tamer' to my resume."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Scrap:** "Affirmative, Mistress. Would you like me to crush the next one who runs?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "No, Scrap. We need them alive. Who else will admire my dress?"
