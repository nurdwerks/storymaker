# Character Profile: Medic "Stitch"

**Archetype:** The Healer / The Protector of Flesh
**True Sin:** ENVY (He hates the magic that heals Angelica while he has to use needles and thread to keep his friends alive).
**Virtue Mask:** COMPASSION (He frames his insults as "Medical Advice").

## I. Role in the Story

Medic "Stitch" is the squad medic who patches Ria up after every fight. He represents the physical toll of the "Iron Vanguard's" life and the human cost of Angelica's commands.

- **The Friction:** He scolds Angelica for "working Ria too hard," treating her strategic requests as a form of abuse.
- **The Reminder:** He reminds everyone that Ria is "flesh and blood," not a machine or "clockwork like you," which reinforces the idea that Angelica is something other than human.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Resource Scarcity / Moral Failure. **Location: Book 4, Chapter 11 (The Tri-age).** During the Silt-fever outbreak and resource shortage, Stitch refuses to treat a dying enemy civilian to save the last antibiotics for Ria's rust infection. He prioritizes the Unit over humanity.
  **Quote:** _"The Vanguard comes first. Everyone else is just biology waiting to rot."_
- **Impact on Ria:** Ria backs Stitch’s decision, causing a permanent rift between her and Angelica. Angelica realizes that Ria's loyalty is to the "Unit," not to the "People," shattering the ideal of Ria as a savior.
- **Impact on Entourage:** Stitch becomes a figure of clinical coldness. He stops treating his patients as "boys" and starts seeing them as "inventory," turning the medical bay into a place of sterile, transactional survival.
