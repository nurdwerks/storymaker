  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Reveals his interest in Angelica as a "Null" who might be "coded" like a formatted hard drive rather than born with natural magic.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I want to see if that mind of yours—that chaotic, brilliant, scavenging mind—can survive a real challenge."

- **Key Event:** Vane tosses the medicine vial to Angelica, noting it will buy Leo a month or two. Winning the Selection is the only path to a permanent cure.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You treat the law like a suggestion, Miss Vance. Fortunately, so do I."
