## Chapter 36: The Pull

### Scene 1: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** The _Zenith_ initiates the Star-Tear jump sequence, but the alien Mothership fires a "Gravity Tether"—a massive beam of coherent gravitons—that latches onto the ship's stern.
- **Detailed Description:** The Bridge is bathed in the strobing red of emergency lights. The main viewscreen shows the rear feed: a beam of sickly green light connecting the _Zenith_ to the massive, crab-like Mothership. The ship shudders violently as the two opposing forces—the Star-Tear Drive pulling forward into hyperspace and the Tether pulling backward into real space—fight for dominance. The hull screams, a sound like tearing metal amplified through the deck plates. Sparks shower from the ceiling consoles. The artificial gravity fluctuates, throwing crew members against the walls.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica, fused to the Interface Throne, feels the stress not as data, but as physical agony. The ship is her body. She feels the Tether like a hook in her spine. She screams, her back arching, her eyes glowing white with the strain. She knows that if she doesn't break the connection, the ship will be ripped in two.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Physically feels the strain of the tractor beam through the neural link, describing the sensation as being "drawn and quartered." She refuses to sever the link to save herself, maintaining the connection to keep the drive stable.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I can't break free! They're too heavy! They're anchoring us to local space! It feels like... like they're pulling my arms off!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ship AI:** "Warning. Structural integrity at 12%. Keel fracture imminent. Hull separation in 30 seconds."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen and Ria attempt to target the source of the Tether with the ship's rear batteries, but the Mothership's shields are impervious to standard weaponry.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria works the tactical station, her hands flying over the controls. On the screen, plasma bolts splash harmlessly against the green energy shield of the alien vessel. It absorbs the energy, glowing brighter. The Mothership begins to reel them in, pulling the _Zenith_ backward out of the singularity's throat.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria feels a surge of helplessness. Her weapons, usually her solution to everything, are useless. She punches the console in frustration, denting the metal. Kaelen stands by Angelica, watching her writhe in pain. He wants to pull her out of the chair, to save her from the torture, but he knows that unseating her now would kill everyone. He is forced to watch the woman he loves suffer for the greater good.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "It's not working! Their shields are eating the fire! We need a bigger gun!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "There are no bigger guns, Ria! We have to cut the rope!"

### Scene 2: The Trash Server

- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane's digital avatar, trapped in the ship's waste management server ("The Trash"), establishes a text-only link to the Bridge.
- **Detailed Description:** A small, overlooked terminal near the engineering station flickers to life. Green text scrolls rapidly across the screen. It is Vane. Even in his digital purgatory, he is monitoring the ship's telemetry. He realizes that if the ship is destroyed, his consciousness dies with it.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane is driven by pure self-preservation. He hates helping Angelica, but he hates non-existence more. He analyzes the Tether's frequency and realizes it is a harmonic resonance lock.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Vane** — Displays a desperate, survival-at-all-costs attitude even while trapped in a loop, providing critical technical warnings that the crew might ignore because of the source.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane (Text):** "YOU IDIOTS. YOU ARE PULLING AGAINST A STATIC LOAD. YOU WILL SNAP THE SPINE. CHANGE THE FREQUENCY. OSCILLATE THE SHIELD HARMONICS. MAKE THE HULL SLIPPERY."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Is that... Vane? I thought we flushed him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "He doesn't want to die. Listen to him. Adjust the shield frequency!"

### Scene 3: The Engine Room

- **Key Event:** Chief Engineer Rylan (or the current head of engineering) attempts to execute Vane's plan, oscillating the shield harmonics to disrupt the Tether's grip.
- **Detailed Description:** The Engine Room is a hellscape of steam and radiation alarms. Engineers in protective suits are running to reinforce the structural dampeners. The main drive core is pulsing with a dangerous, erratic rhythm. Rylan inputs the oscillating frequency. The ship's shields begin to flicker rapidly, shifting through the light spectrum.
- **Internal Conflict:** The crew in engineering knows they are pushing the core beyond its safety limits. If the shields collapse entirely, the radiation from the singularity will cook them instantly. They work with the grim fatalism of the condemned.

- **Key Event:** The oscillation works momentarily, causing the Tether to slip. The _Zenith_ lurches forward, sliding deeper into the wormhole.
- **Detailed Description:** The green beam flickers and detaches for a split second. The sudden release of tension throws everyone to the deck. The ship accelerates, the stars outside streaking into infinite lines of light. Angelica gasps as the pain recedes, slumping in the throne.
- **Internal Conflict:** For a moment, there is hope. The silence of the void returns. But then the Mothership fires again.

### Scene 4: The Second Tether

- **Key Event:** The Mothership fires a second, more powerful Tether. This one doesn't just grab the hull; it grabs the singularity itself, anchoring the wormhole to the Mothership's mass.
- **Detailed Description:** The green beam widens, engulfing the entire rear of the _Zenith_ and the swirling vortex of the Star-Tear. The Mothership isn't just pulling the ship; it is pulling the door shut. The wormhole begins to collapse around them. The tunnel of light turns jagged and red.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica realizes the enemy understands their technology better than they do. They are not just brute force; they are physics masters. She feels the walls of reality closing in. She knows that standard maneuvering is over. To escape this, she will have to do something impossible. She will have to become the drive.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They aren't just holding us. They're closing the throat. We're going to be crushed."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane (Text):** "CRITICAL FAILURE. SINGULARITY COLLAPSE IN 10 SECONDS. WE ARE DEAD. WE ARE DEAD."
