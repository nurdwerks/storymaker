# Chapter 22: The Finale

The wind at ten thousand feet didn't just blow; it hunted.

It screamed around the crystal spire of the Zenith Academy like a living thing, a hungry ghost tearing at the three tiny figures clinging to the translucent staircase. It was a physical weight, a wall of pressurized air that threatened to peel them from the glass steps and cast them into the abyss of clouds three thousand feet below.

Angelica counted. It was the only way she could keep her legs moving.

_Nine thousand, four hundred and twelve._

Her breath rasped in her throat, a jagged shard of ice with every inhale. The air was thin up here, barely enough to fuel a starving lung, let alone a body pushed past the brink of exhaustion. Her vision was tunneling, the edges of the world fraying into grey static. All she could see were the heels of Kaelen's boots in front of her, moving with a rhythmic, machine-like precision.

_Nine thousand, four hundred and thirteen._

They had been climbing for four hours.

The final stage of the Iron Selection wasn't a battle. It wasn't a puzzle. It was a simple, brutal equation of endurance. Ten thousand steps. A vertical ascent that wound around the exterior of the central Spire like a glass ribbon. No railing. No safety net. Just a three-foot-wide path of slick, frosted diamon-glass separating them from the fall.

To their left, the smooth, impenetrable wall of the tower rose endlessly into the bruised purple sky. To their right, the drop. A sheer, terrifying plunge into the white ocean of the cloud layer.

Angelica didn't look right. She looked at the boots.

Behind her, she heard the heavy, mechanical whine of Ria's servos. The sound was wrong—a grinding, high-pitched screech that spoke of overheated bearings and failing hydraulics.

"Keep... moving..." Ria gasped over the comms, her voice distorted by the static of the storm. "Don't... stop... Runt."

Angelica risked a glance back.

Ria looked like a wreck. Her massive Titan armor, the shell that had made her a god in the arena, was now a prison. It was dead weight. The power cells were drained, the atmospheric scrubbers clogged with ice. She was dragging five hundred pounds of inert steel up the mountain, fueled only by stubbornness and rage. Her helmet was gone—lost somewhere around step six thousand—and her face was a mask of frost and grim determination. A line of frozen blood ran from her nose to her chin.

"I'm... going," Angelica wheezed.

She looked ahead. Kaelen hadn't slowed down. He hadn't faltered. He moved with an efficiency that was almost insulting. He wasn't wearing armor. He was dressed in his black combat fatigues, the fabric whipping violently in the gale. He didn't seem to fight the wind so much as slip through it, finding the currents of least resistance.

He was the blade. Ria was the hammer. And Angelica?

She was the rust.

She was the friction that slowed them down. Every step cost her more than it cost them. She didn't have Kaelen's training or Ria's strength. She had sticks for legs and lungs filled with Silt-dust.

_Nine thousand, four hundred and twenty._

Her boot slipped.

It was a patch of black ice, invisible against the dark glass. Her right foot shot out into empty air.

Gravity, the patient monster, snatched at her.

She tipped sideways. The wind caught her, pushing her shouders, eager to help her fall. For a split second, she stared down into the swirling white void. It looked peaceful. It looked soft. It would be so easy to just let go, to stop the burning in her legs, to sleep.

A hand clamped onto her wrist.

It wasn't a gentle grip. It was a vice.

Kaelen didn't turn around. He reached back without breaking stride, his fingers locking around her forearm with enough force to bruise the bone. He jerked her forward, pulling her back onto the center of the step.

"Focus, Ward," he said. His voice wasn't breathless. It was calm, clipped, and cold. "If you fall, you take us with you. The tether has a tensile limit."

Angelica looked down at her waist. The thin, molecular-bond cable connecting the three of them—Ria at the back, Kaelen at the front, her in the middle—was taut. If she went over, she would become an anchor. She would peel them both off the wall.

"Sorry," she gasped.

"Don't be sorry," Kaelen said, releasing her arm. "Be vertical."

He kept climbing.

Angelica swallowed the bile in her throat and forced her foot to find the next step.

_Nine thousand, four hundred and twenty-one._

The cold was an enemy she hadn't accounted for. In the Silt, cold was damp and heavy. Here, it was sharp. It bit through her thermal undersuit, seeking out the warmth of her blood. Her fingers were numb inside her gloves. Her nose felt like a block of wood. The moisture in her eyes was freezing, gluing her lashes together.

She thought about the heat of the Foundry. She visualized the roaring furnaces, the sweat, the smell of molten copper. She tried to summon that warmth, to wrap it around her core.

It didn't work. The wind stole it.

_Nine thousand, five hundred._

The sky was changing.

The grey clouds were falling away, replaced by a deep, indigo twilight. They were climbing above the weather. The sun, which had been hidden for days, suddenly broke across the curve of the Spire. It wasn't the yellow, filtered sun of the lower levels. It was a blinding, harsh white star that burned the retina.

"Sunlight," Ria grunted. "Real... sunlight."

Angelica squinted against the glare. It was beautiful. It was terrifying. It revealed the scratches on the glass steps, the vastness of the world below, the impossible height of their ascent.

They were ants climbing a needle.

_Nine thousand, eight hundred._

Her legs were screaming. Every muscle fiber was tearing, rebuilding, and tearing again. She was running on reserves she didn't know she had. She was hallucinating. She saw her father standing on a cloud, holding a wrench. She saw the old junk dealer from Sector 12, laughing at her.

_Keep walking, girl. Just keep walking._

_Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety._

"Platform," Kaelen announced.

Angelica looked up.

Ten steps above them, the ribbon ended. It flared out into a wide, flat disc of polished obsidian.

The summit.

The last ten steps were the hardest. Her body knew it was over, and it wanted to quit right there. _Close enough,_ it whispered. _You made it close enough._

She forced herself to lift her boot. One. Two. Three.

Kaelen stepped onto the platform. He didn't collapse. He walked to the center and stood there, scanning the perimeter, his weapon drawn. Always the soldier.

Angelica hit the last step. She stumbled forward, her knees giving out. She didn't try to catch herself. She fell face-first onto the black stone.

It was warm.

The obsidian had been soaking up the sun. It radiated a gentle, trapped heat that seeped into her cheek. She groaned and rolled over, staring up at the darkening sky.

Ria crashed onto the platform a moment later. The sound was like a car wreck—metal shrieking against stone as she fell to her knees, then slumped forward. Her armor clattered, dead and heavy.

"Stairs..." Ria wheezed, tearing off a gauntlet to wipe the blood from her face. "I hate... stairs. If there isn't... an elevator... on the way down... I'm jumping."

Angelica laughed. It was a dry, hacking sound that hurt her chest. "We made it. We actually made it. The math said we wouldn't."

"The math," Kaelen said, his silhouette dark against the sun, "didn't account for determination."

He holstered his weapon. He walked over to them, looking down with an expression that might have been pride, or might have been simple calculation.

"Extraction point confirmed," he said. "We are the first. The other signals have ceased. Squad Gold is gone. Squad chrome is gone. We are the apex."

Ria rolled onto her back, her massive chestplate heaving. "Apex predators, baby. Squad Iron. Unbreakable."

She held up a fist. It was a struggle for her to lift the weight of the armor, but she did it.

Angelica looked at the fist. She looked at Kaelen.

Slowly, painfully, she raised her own hand and bumped her knuckles against Ria's.

Kaelen hesitated. He looked at the two of them—the giant and the scavenger, the hammer and the grease—lying on the ground. He looked at his own gloved hand.

Then, slowly, he crouched down. He extended his fist.

_Thud._

The three of them connected. A circuit closed.

"Unbreakable," Kaelen whispered.

For a moment, on top of the world, with the wind howling around them and the sun burning their eyes, they were a unit. They were a team. They had defied the odds, the system, and gravity itself.

Then the sky broke open.

It started with a hum. A deep, resonant vibration that shook the obsidian platform beneath them.

Angelica sat up, her mechanic's ear instantly tuning into the frequency. "Heavy repulsors. High output. Something big is coming."

The center of the platform began to glow. Lines of white light etched themselves into the stone, forming a complex geometric mandala.

"Get up," Kaelen ordered, stepping back. "Formation."

Ria groaned, but she obeyed. She rolled to her knees, servos widening in protest, and hauled herself upright. She swayed, locking her leg joints to stay standing.

Angelica scrambled to her feet. She stood between them, swaying in the wind.

A beam of light shot up from the center of the mandala. It was a hologram generator, but not the cheap, flickering ones they used in the Silt. This was high-fidelity, solid-light technology.

The column of light coalesced into a figure.

It was fifty feet tall. It towered over them, a giant made of photon and arrogance.

Headmaster Vane.

He looked impeccable. His white scholar's robes were pristine, unstained by blood or grease. His silver hair was perfectly coiffed. His face, magnified to the size of a billboard, beamed down at them with a benevolence that made Angelica's skin crawl.

"Welcome," Vane's voice boomed. It didn't come from a speaker; it seemed to come from the sky itself. "Welcome to the Zenith."

Around the giant hologram, dozens of smaller screens flickered into existence. They floated in the air, creating a ring of digital surveillance.

Angelica looked at the screens. She saw... herself.

She saw Ria, bloody and battered. She saw Kaelen, stone-faced and alert.

And behind the feeds, she saw the audience.

Millions of comments scrolled past in a blur of text. Emojis. Betting odds. Cheers. Jeers.

_IRON SQUAD!_
_LOOK AT THE BIG ONE, SHE'S ABOUT TO PASS OUT._
_THE BOY IS COLD. I LIKE HIM._
_THE RUNT IS STILL ALIVE? HOW?_

"You are live," Vane said, his giant hand sweeping across the horizon. "The eyes of the City are upon you. You are the heroes of the hour."

Ria straightened up, puffing out her chest. She wiped the blood from her chin, trying to look heroic for the cameras.

"Squad Iron," Vane continued. "You have exceeded all variables. You have defeated the beasts of the Menagerie. You have solved the Riddles of the Spheres. You have climbed the Needle. You have proven that the Silt can, occasionally, produce gold."

The applause was piped in—a roaring, oceanic sound of thousands of people clapping. It sounded fake. Canned.

"We won," Ria whispered. "We actually won."

Anglica didn't smile. She was watching Vane's eyes. The hologram was high-resolution enough to capture the micro-expressions. There was a twitch at the corner of his mouth. A tightness.

He was smiling, but his eyes were dead.

"However," Vane said.

The word hung in the air like a guillotine blade.

The applause cut off instantly. The silence that followed was louder than the wind.

"We have encountered a... let's call it a logistical error," Vane said smoothly. He clasped his hands behind his back, the picture of regrettable administrative failure. "It seems that during the excitement of the final round, our actuarial algorithms miscalculated the fuel consumption of the retrieval unit. The primary extraction cruiser was... re-tasked. To a garden party in the Cloud District, I believe."

He chuckled. It was a soft, polite sound that echoed like thunder across the platform.

"Due to these unforeseen budgetary constraints regarding the fuel allocation for long-range extraction, the shuttle sent to retrieve you is a Class-B courier. It is a delightful little ship, really. Very fast. Very efficient. Used mostly for transporting urgent diplomatic missives or rare biological samples."

He paused. He looked down at them, like a child examining bugs in a jar.

"However, its efficiency comes at a cost. The life-support systems are minimal. Mass-optimized. It has a maximum life-support capacity for two personnel."

Angelica froze. The wind whipped her hair across her face, blinding her for a second, but she didn't move to brush it away. Her mind was racing, replaying the words. _Class-B Courier. Life support capacity._

"Two seats," Vane clarified, his voice dripping with faux-sympathy. "But there are three of you. How unfortunate. A terrifying remainder."

He snapped his fingers.

From the clouds above, a ship descended.

It was sleek, silver, and silent. It looked like a teardrop made of mercury. It lowered itself on silent thrusters, hovering just off the edge of the platform. The heat from its engines washed over them, a momentary respite from the freezing cold that felt like a taunt.

The canopy hissed open.

There were two seats. Two buckets of white leather, molded for comfort. Between them was a small console. Behind them, nothing but the engine bulkhead.

Two.

Ria stared at the empty seats. Her brain, usually so quick in a fight, seemed to grind to a halt. The adrenaline that had carried her up the stairs was fading, leaving her cold and confused.

"But... we're a squad," she stammered. "We finished together. The rules... the orientation packet said..."

"The rules?" Vane laughed. It was a rich, baritone sound that shook the platform. "Oh, child. Did you actually read the orientation packet? Or did you just look at the pictures?"

He leaned forward, his giant face looming over them.

"Rules are for the games. Rules are for the playground. This is reality. In the Zenith, there are no squads. There are no friends. There are no promised lands where everyone holds hands and sings."

He gestured to the city floating in the distance.

"There is only the Hierarchy. There are those who have the strength to take a seat, and those who are left standing. Every chair in that city was taken by someone who pushed someone else out of it."

The screens spiraled around him, showing the audience reaction. The chat feed was accelerating, a blur of neon text.

_DRAMA SPIKE!_
_TWO SEATS? THAT'S BRUTAL._
_I BET ON THE BIG ONE DYING._
_NO WAY, THE BOY IS TOO FAST._
_KILL THE RUNT! SHE'S USELESS!_
_THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ARENA!_

"This is the final test," Vane announced to the cameras. "The test of Will. The test of Ambition. The test of Sacrifice."

"You lied," Angelica whispered. Her voice was lost in the wind, but Vane heard it.

Vane looked at her. His eyes, the size of swimming pools, narrowed.

"I optimized," he corrected. "I created a scenario to extract the maximum potential from my assets. Comfort breeds mediocrity, Miss Ward. Desperation breeds excellence. And right now, I need to see which assets are truly valuable and which are merely... redundant."

He pointed a finger at the shuttle.

"You have five minutes to decide who takes the seats. If you do not decide... the shuttle leaves empty. And the platform enters its scheduled sanitation cycle."

"Sanitation?" Ria asked.

"Plasma purge," Kaelen said softly. "To clean the bird droppings off the observation deck. It heats the stone to three thousand degrees."

Angelica looked at her feet. The black stone.

"Whoever stays, burns," she said.

3 - 2 = 1.

It was the simplest equation she had ever solved. And the cruelest.

"You can't do this!" Ria shouted at the hologram. She took a step forward, her fists clenching. "We won! We beat your game! You owe us!"

"I owe you nothing but the opportunity to prove your worth," Vane replied coldly. "The Universe does not owe you survival. You must take it."

A red digital timer materialized in the air above the shuttle. The numbers were ten feet tall, burning against the purple sky.

**05:00**

**04:59**

The ticking wasn't audible, but Angelica felt it. Each second was a heartbeat.

The atmosphere on the platform shifted.

The wind seemed to drop. The world narrowed down to the fifty-meter circle of stone.

The bond—the fragile, hard-won trust they had built over the last week—shattered. It didn't break slowly; it exploded.

Angelica felt the shift in Kaelen before he even moved. It was a change in pressure. A sharpening of the air.

He took a half-step back. It was a subtle movement, a shift of weight to his back foot. His right hand drifted, almost casually, to the hilt of the mono-blade strapped to his thigh.

It was a reflex. Or a plan.

Ria saw it.

Her eyes went wide. The hurt, the confusion, vanished, replaced by the primal instinct of a cornered animal.

_Whirrrr._

The servos in her arm whined as she pre-charged her hydraulic actuators. Her posture shifted from exhausted slump to combat crouch.

They stood in a triangle. The wind whipped their hair. They looked at each other, and the friends Angelica thought she had made were gone. In their place were a Titan and an Assassin.

"Don't do it, Night," Ria growled. Her voice was low, dangerous. "Don't you dare touch that sword."

Kaelen didn't look at her face. He looked at her neck. He was calculating the angle.

"Two seats," Kaelen said. His voice was devoid of emotion. It was pure logic. "The prompt is a survival scenario. Logic dictates the strongest survive. We are resources. One of us is redundant."

"Redundant?" Ria shouted. "I saved your life in the Foundry! I took the hit from the Behemoth!"

"Past tense," Kaelen said. "That variable has been processed. The current variable is weight vs. utility. You are damaged. Your armor is failing. You are a liability."

"I am a tank!" Ria roared. "I am the muscle!"

"You are a hammer," Kaelen corrected. "I am a blade. Hammers are clumsy. Hammers are easily dodged."

"Stop it!"

Angelica stepped between them.

She felt tiny. She was unarmored, unarmed, and weighed a hundred pounds soaking wet. She stood between a man who could move faster than the eye could follow and a woman who could punch through concrete.

"Stop it!" she screamed again. "This is what he wants! Look at him!"

She pointed at the giant hologram. Vane was watching them with a look of intense, scholarly interest. He was taking notes on a datapad.

"He wants a show!" Angelica yelled. "He wants us to kill each other for the ratings! If we fight, he wins!"

"One of us has to die, Angelica," Kaelen said. He didn't look at Vane. He didn't look at her. His eyes were locked on Ria. "That is the boundary condition. There is no solution where all three survive."

"There's always a solution!" Angelica insisted. "We can... we can strip the armor! Reduce the weight! We can squeeze into the cargo hold!"

"Class-B couriers don't have cargo holds," Kaelen said. "And the life support is hard-capped. Oxygen for two. If three get on, we all suffocate before we hit the Zenith."

He looked at Angelica then. For a second, the mask slipped. She saw regret. She saw pain.

"I have a mission, Ward. I have to reach the top. Nothing can stop that. Not you. Not her."

His hand tightened on the hilt.

"Ria is the logical elimination."

"Try it, pretty boy," Ria snarled. She raised her fists. "Come and try to eliminate me."

Angelica looked at Kaelen's eyes.

She expected to see hesitation. She expected to see the boy who had helped her climb, who had shared his rations.

She saw nothing.

She saw the eyes of a shark. Flat. Dead. Efficient.

He wasn't bluffing. He wasn't debating. He had already formulated the plan. He knew exactly how he was going to kill Ria. He was just waiting for the wind to die down so his strike would be true.

"Three chairs," Kaelen whispered. "Two musical notes left. The music stops now."

**03:30**

The timer ticked down.

"Play," Kaelen said.

He drew his sword.

The sound of the mono-blade activating was a sharp _snap-hiss_. The edge vibrated at a frequency that made Angelica's teeth ache. It was a blur of silver, a line of coherent force that could cut through diamond.

Ria roared. It wasn't a word; it was a release of pressure. She charged.

She didn't have a weapon, but she didn't need one. She was a siege engine. She lowered her shoulder, activating the last vestiges of her armor's power, and plowed forward like a runaway train.

Kaelen didn't meet the charge. He flowed around it.

He stepped to the left, pivoting on the ball of his foot. As Ria thundered past, he lashed out with the flat of his blade, slapping it against the back of her knee joint.

_CLANG._

The impact was precise. It hit the servo housing, denting the metal. Ria stumbled, her momentum carrying her forward. She crashed onto one knee, sliding toward the edge of the platform.

" clumsy," Kaelen observed. "Too much mass. Too much inertia."

Ria scrambled up, spinning around. Her face was red with fury. "Stand still and fight me!"

"Why?" Kaelen asked, circling her. "So you can hit me? That seems counter-productive."

He lunged.

It was a testing strike. A quick flick of the wrist aimed at her elbow.

Ria threw up her arm to block. The gauntlet took the hit. The mono-blade sliced into the hardened ceramite plating like it was butter, carving a deep, glowing groove.

Ria hissed. "You little..."

She swung a backhand. Kaelen ducked. The massive metal fist whistled through the air where his head had been a microsecond before.

Angelica watched, paralyzed.

It wasn't a fight. It was an execution in slow motion.

She analyzed the variables.

_Subject: Ria. Strength: 9/10. Speed: 2/10. Emotional State: Berserk._
_Subject: Kaelen. Strength: 4/10. Speed: 9/10. Emotional State: Cold._

The outcome was inevitable. Ria was fighting an enemy she couldn't catch. Kaelen was dismantling her, piece by piece. He wasn't trying to kill her quickly. He was waiting for the opening—the moment when her anger made her overextend, leaving her neck exposed.

"Kaelen, stop!" Angelica shouted.

Kaelen ignored her. He feinted left, drawing a clumsy block from Ria, then spun right, slashing across her chest plate. Sparks showered the obsidian.

"Yield," Kaelen said. "Step off the platform. Save yourself the pain."

"Go to hell!" Ria screamed. She grabbed a chunk of loose obsidian from the floor—debris from the construction of the platform—and hurled it.

Kaelen sliced the rock in half in mid-air. Dust exploded around him.

Through the dust, he lunged again.

It wasn't a feint this time. It was a killing stroke. He moved like smoke, closing the distance in a heartbeat. The mono-blade hummed, a blur of silver light aiming for the joint in Ria's neck armor—the only weak spot.

The room was silent, save for the hum of the cooling fans for the massive crystal display that dominated the wall.

The Emperor sat on his throne.

He was a withered husk of a man, his body more machine than flesh. Tubes ran from his chest into the golden throne, cycling his blood, pumping specific mixtures of spice and stimulant to keep his failing organs functioning. His left eye was a complex optical sensor, a cluster of red lenses that rotated and zoomed with insectoid precision.

He watched the screen. He watched the tiny figures on the obsidian disk high above the clouds.

He saw the blade come out. He saw the giantess brace for impact.

But his eye wasn't watching the fighters.

It was watching the small girl in the middle. The one with the messy hair and the greased-stained tunic.

"The girl from the Silt," The Emperor rasped. His voice sounded like dry leaves sliding over stone. "She positions herself as the shield. Interesting."

He tapped a finger on the arm of his throne.

"Most candidates run. Most candidates hide. Or they join the killer. She stands in the middle."

A figure stepped out of the shadows behind the throne. A tall, thin man in grey robes.

"Prelate Vane believes she is a chaotic element, Your Radiance," the figure said. "He believes she destabilizes the squad dynamics."

"Vane sees the world in binary," The Emperor scoffed. "He sees ones and zeros. He forgets the decimals. The decimals are where the nuance lies."

The Emperor leaned forward. His mechanical eye whirred, zooming in on Angelica's face. He saw the terror there. But he also saw the calculation. Her eyes were darting around, looking at the shuttle, looking at the platform, looking at the hologram.

"She isn't just standing there," The Emperor murmured. "She's thinking. She's solving."

He smiled. A rare, gruesome expression that cracked the dry skin of his lips.

"Let them fight. Let us see if the chaos can break the order."

**Department of Assets - Sub-Level 4**

Lord Cromwell did not have a crystal screen. He did not have a throne.

He had a desk covered in paper.

He sat in the dim light of a green-shaded lamp, his fountain pen scratching across the pages of the Black Ledger.

On a small, black-and-white monitor propped up against a stack of books, the feed from the Spire played out in grainy low-resolution.

Cromwell didn't watch the drama. He watched the data.

He watched the biometric feeds scrolling on the side of the screen.

_Subject: RIA. Heart rate: 180bpm. Cortisol: Critical. Adrenaline: Maximum. Status: Fight/Flight._

_Subject: NIGHT. Heart rate: 60bpm. Cortisol: Nominal. Adrenaline: Controlled. Status: Executioner._

_Subject: WARD. Heart rate: 140bpm. Cortisol: High. Brain activity: Abnormal spike in theta waves._

Cromwell paused. He tapped the pen against his chin, staring at the grainy image of the girl standing between the two combatants.

"Theta waves," he whispered. "Deep thought. Problem solving. In the middle of a Mexican standoff."

He reached for a stack of files on the corner of his desk. He pulled out a dusty folder marked _Project: ECHO - 20 years ago._

He opened it. Inside was a faded photograph of a young man with similar eyes. A man who had burned down half the Citadel before they put him down.

"Resonance matches," Cromwell muttered. "The cognitive pattern is identical. Stress-inverse scaling. The more chaos, the more clarity."

He looked back at the screen.

"You aren't going to fight them, are you, little Mechanic?" he murmured. "You know you can't win a physical confrontation. The math doesn't work. Force equals mass times acceleration, and you have neither."

He watched her eyes darting around. She wasn't looking at the sword. She wasn't looking at the fist. She was looking at the shuttle.

"So what are you going to do? Change the variables?"

He wrote in the ledger, his handwriting becoming jagged with haste.

_Candidate Ward demonstrates non-linear tactical processing. While Subjects Night and Ria are locked in a binary conflict (Fight/Die), Subject Ward is attempting to access a third outcome._

_Potential leverage point: Her attachment to the unit. She values the collective over the self. This is a weakness in the Arena. But in the Directorate?_

He paused.

_In the Directorate, loyalty is a currency more valuable than gold._

He looked at Kaelen Night's entry one more time.

_Candidate Night shows sociopathic compartmentalization. Willingness to terminate allies for mission success. High utility for black-ops. Low utility for leadership. He will burn the village to save the map._

Cromwell sighed. He dipped his pen in the inkwell. The ink was black, thick, and smelled of iron.

"Vane is building a butcher shop," he said to the empty room. "He wants meat. He wants grinders. He wants noise."

He looked back at Angelica Ward.

"I don't need meat. I need a surgeon. I need someone who can cut out the cancer without killing the patient."

He marked a star next to Angelica's name. Then he circled it. Then he underlined it.

_File for enhanced monitoring. Designate: Project VELVET._

_Priority: Alpha._

_If she survives the next three minutes... active recruitment protocols. Bypass the Wardens. Bypass Vane._

He checked his pocket watch. The gold casing was dented, a souvenir from a war no one remembered.

**02:15**

"Tick tock, children," Cromwell whispered. "The bus is leaving. Make your choice. Show me what you are."

---

**The Summit**

"Kaelen, stop!" Angelica shouted.

Kaelen lunged.

It wasn't a feint. It was a killing stroke. He moved like smoke, closing the distance in a heartbeat. The mono-blade hummed, a blur of silver light aiming for the joint in Ria's neck armor—the only weak spot.

Ria roared and swung her massive fist. It was a haymaker, a blow that would have taken Kaelen's head off if it connected.

It didn't.

Kaelen ducked under the swing. He slid across the smooth obsidian, pivoting on his heel. He came up behind her.

"Goodbye, Titan," he whispered.

He raised the sword.

Angelica didn't think. She didn't calculate. She just moved.

She threw herself at Kaelen.

She hit him from the side, a hundred pounds of desperate momentum slamming into his ribs. It wasn't enough to hurt him, but it was enough to knock him off balance.

The sword slashed down, missing Ria's neck by an inch. It sparked against her shoulder plate, carving a deep gash in the steel.

Kaelen stumbled back. He spun around, his eyes blazing with cold fury.

"Ward!" he snapped. "Get out of the way!"

"No!" Angelica scrambled to her feet, putting herself between them again. "I won't let you!"

"You can't save her!" Kaelen yelled. "Do the math! One dies, or three die! It's logic!"

"Screw your logic!" Angelica screamed. "It's wrong! The variables are wrong!"

She pointed at the shuttle.

"Look at it! Look at the thrusters! Look at the displacement volume!"

Kaelen blinked. "What?"

"It's a Class-B Courier!" Angelica shouted, her mind racing, connecting dots that only she could see. "I fixed one of these in Sector 12! The life support isn't limited by oxygen generation! It's limited by CO2 scrubbing capacity!"

She ran toward the shuttle.

"Angelica, wait!" Ria yelled. "The timer!"

**01:00**

Angelica reached the shuttle. She didn't climb into the seat. She scrambled onto the fuselage. She ripped open an access panel near the engine intake.

"What are you doing?" Vane's hologram boomed. "Get away from the vehicle!"

Angelica ignored him. She reached into her belt and pulled out her multi-tool.

"The scrubbers!" she yelled back at Kaelen. "They're rated for standard atmospheric density! But we're at high altitude! The air is thinner! The scrubbers don't have to work as hard!"

She jammed her screwdriver into the mechanism. Sparks flew.

"If I bypass the safety interlocks... if I override the occupancy sensor..."

She twisted the tool. Something crunched.

"Ward, step away!" Vane commanded. "This is unauthorized interference!"

"Sue me!" Angelica grunted.

She yanked a wire bundle free. She stripped the ends with her teeth and twisted them together.

_Spark. Fizz._

The display on the shuttle dashboard flickered.

_Occupancy Limit: 2_

It blinked.

_Occupancy Limit: ERROR_

It blinked again.

_Occupancy Limit: UNRESTRICTED_

"Get in!" Angelica screamed, turning to her squad. "Get in now!"

Kaelen stared at her. His sword was still drawn. He looked at the shuttle. He looked at the timer.

**00:30**

He looked at Angelica, standing on the wing of the ship, sparks raining down around her, defying the Headmaster of the Academy with a screwdriver.

A slow smile spread across his face. He sheathed his sword.

"Logic," he said. "Updated."

He grabbed Ria's arm. "Move, Hammer."

Ria didn't argue. She lumbered forward, powered by fear and hope.

They scrambled into the cockpit. Ria squeezed her massive frame into one seat. Kaelen took the other.

"Where do you sit?" Ria yelled.

"Lap belt!" Angelica shouted, jumping down into the cockpit. She didn't take a seat. She sat on the center console, jamming herself between their shoulders. "Squeeze in!"

"This is not safety regulation!" Kaelen said, but he was buckling his harness.

"Fly!" Angelica hit the launch button.

The canopy hissed shut.

**00:10**

The thrusters fired. A massive kick of G-force slammed them back.

The sleek silver ship shot upward, screaming away from the platform.

"You changed the equation," he said.

He looked at the monitor, where Vane's hologram was fading into the distance.

"And I think," Kaelen added softly, "you just made a very powerful enemy."

Angelica closed her eyes.

"Worth it," she said.

The shuttle banked, soaring toward the glittering lights of the Zenith.

They had ascended.

Book 1 was over. But the war had just begun.
