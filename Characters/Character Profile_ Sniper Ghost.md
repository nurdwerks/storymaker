# Character Profile: Sniper "Ghost"

**Archetype:** The Silent Shadow / The Twin
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Lack of presence in any reality outside the battlefield; she has surrendered her personhood to the scope).
**Virtue Mask:** VIGILANCE (Her silence is her duty).

## I. Role in the Story

Sniper "Ghost" is a silent watcher who covers Ria’s back. She represents the telepathic-like coordination and wordless trust that the Vanguard shares.

- **The Silence:** She never speaks to Angelica. She only speaks to Ria.
- **The Third Wheel:** The perfect, silent coordination between Ghost and Ria during battle leaves Angelica feeling like a clumsy intruder in their specialized world of violence.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Accidental Recognition / Betrayal. **Location: Book 2, Chapter 10 (The Sniper's Secret).** Ghost is confronted by a Praetorian Scout, an old academy squadmate, while providing cover for Ria. To protect his cover and the Vanguard, he executes his former friend.
  **Quote:** _"My name is Ghost."_
- **Impact on Ria:** Ria is forced to hide Ghost's secret from the rest of the unit. This shared lie creates a wall of secrecy between her and her soldiers, making her leadership feel increasingly like the very "High-Level" politics she claims to despise.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Shadow" becomes a threat. The entourage begins to suspect there is a traitor among them as Ghost becomes even more withdrawn and aggressive, turning the Vanguard's trust into a state of mutual suspicion.
