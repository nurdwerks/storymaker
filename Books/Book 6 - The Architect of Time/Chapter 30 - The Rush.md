## Chapter 30: The Rush

### Scene 1: The Panic / The Valley

- **Key Event:** "The heat signature from the volcano," Angelica curses. "We lit a beacon."
- **Key Event:** The village wakes up. But it isn't an organized reveille. It's a stampede.
- **Key Event:** People screaming. Running in circles. Grabbing possessions.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar steps onto a supply crate. He bellows. "HOLD!"
- **Key Event:** The sheer volume of his voice stuns them into silence.
- **Key Event:** "If they breach the perimeter, the ship dies!" Ragnar roars. "Warriors! To the wall! We buy them time!"

### Scene 2: The Loading / The Launch Ramp

- **Key Event:** The _Aeterna_ is humming. The engines are warm.
- **Key Event:** A line of civilians snakes up the ramp. It is moving too slowly.

- **Key Event:** A woman tries to drag a heavy wooden chest up the ramp.
- **Key Event:** "Leave it!" Angelica orders.
- **Key Event:** "It's my dowry! Gold! Silver!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica kicks the chest. It tumbles down the ramp, spilling coins into the mud.
- **Key Event:** "It's dead weight!" Angelica screams. "We can't eat gold! We can't breathe silver! Move!"
- **Key Event:** The woman sobs but runs up the ramp.
- **Key Event:** Angelica hates herself. But she counts the pounds. Every ounce matters.

### Scene 3: The Chaos / The Valley Floor

- **Key Event:** "Leave the doll!" she yells. "Pick up the child! Run!"
- **Key Event:** The mother grabs the boy and sprints.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks up. The clouds are parting. Metallic shapes are descending. Drop-ships.

### Scene 4: The Command / The Ramp

- **Key Event:** The ramp is retracting.
- **Key Event:** The last family is hesitating at the bottom.
- **Key Event:** "It's too high!" the father yells.
- **Key Event:** "Jump!" Angelica screams.
- **Key Event:** She reaches down. She grabs the father's hand. She pulls.
- **Key Event:** He scrambles up, dragging his wife and son.
- **Key Event:** They tumble onto the deck plates.
- **Key Event:** "Go! Go! Go!" Angelica shouts, hitting the seal button. "Your life is up there! Run!"
- **Key Event:** The airlock hisses shut. The screams of the dying are cut off.
- **Key Event:** Now, there is only the hum of the ship. And the silence of the survivors.
