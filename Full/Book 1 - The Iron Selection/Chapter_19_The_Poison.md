# Chapter 19: The Poison

The Slag-Heaps of Sector 4 were not just a dumping ground; they were a geological era of mistakes.

For three hundred years, the Foundry above had vomited its refuse into this abyss. It settled in layers, a stratification of industrial failure. The bottom layer was the "Old Iron"—rusted, massive girders from the First Expansion, twisted into shapes that looked like the skeletons of dead leviathans. Above that was the "Glass Age"—shards of silicate and fiber-optics, millions of tons of it, creating glittering, treacherous dunes that could slice a boot—and the foot inside it—to ribbons.

And on top, sealing it all in a wet, suffocating blanket, was the "Sludge."

It was a chemical stew of runoff, coolant, and degraded magical byproducts. It formed lakes of iridescent oil that bubbled with slow, lazy toxicity. It formed rivers of neon-green acid that carved canyons through the rust.

The air here didn't just smell; it tasted. It tasted of ozone, sulfur, and the sweet, sickly-rot of mana that had gone bad. It coated the throat with a film of metallic grease.

Kaelen Night moved through this rotting garden like a ghost.

He didn't step on the ground; he negotiated with it. His boots found the solid patches of iron amidst the glass dunes. He avoided the rainbow-sheen puddles, knowing that the beauty was a lure for the corrosive death beneath.

He had been awake for thirty hours.

His HUD was a clutter of red warning icons, most of which he had minimized to the periphery of his vision.

_Hydration: Critical._
_Caloric Reserves: 12% (Ketosis active)._
_Muscle Fatigue: Level 3 (Micro-tearing detected in quadriceps)._

He ignored them all. They were just data points. Noise.

He was hunting.

_Objective: Secure Sector Perimeter. Identify threats. Eliminate._

The mandate from the Selection Committee was simple: "Survive." But for House Night, survival was not a passive act. You didn't survive by hiding. You survived by ensuring that you were the only thing left alive in the room.

He paused near a ridge of compressed trash. It was a hill made entirely of crushed ventilation fans, their blades creating a jagged, rusty saw-tooth horizon.

He didn't crouch; he simply stopped moving. His grey cloak, treated with photo-reactive dyes, shifted slightly to match the rust-brown of the fans. He became a shadow. A piece of the debris.

_Silence._

The Sector was too quiet.

Usually, the Slag-Heaps were noisy. Scavenger-drones—little crab-like machines built from scrap—scuttled over the glass, picking for copper. Gas vents hissed like dying snakes. The settling of the trash piles created a constant, deep groaning sound, like the stomach of a hungry god.

But now? Nothing.

The drones were gone. The gas seemed to be holding its breath.

_Observation: Disruption in ambient noise floor._
_Hypothesis: Predator presence._
_Conclusion: Prepare for engagement._

He shifted his grip on his dual blades. The monofilament edges hummed, a sound so low it was felt in the teeth rather than heard.

They emerged from the fog like polished statues.

Three of them.

They didn't move like scavengers. Scavengers stayed low, scurrying, apologetic for their existence. These figures walked tall. They claimed the space. They stepped on the glass dunes and didn't care if the crunch announced them.

Their armor was brilliant chrome, unmarred by the soot of the lower levels. It reflected the dim ambient light, creating halos of white glare in the gloom. They carried energy pikes—weapons with glowing plasma tips that cost more than Kaelen's entire education.

Squad Silver.

High-born. Well-fed. And judging by their formation—a loose, arrogant wedge—they were bored.

"There he is," the point man said. His voice was amplified, booming through the quiet. "The Shadow. He looks... small."

"He looks tired," the second one laughed. He tapped his mace against his palm. "House Night always breeds them to break. Glass cannons. All speed, no stamina."

"Are we really wasting charges on this?" the third one—the Knife-man—asked. He sounded disappointed. "I thought the Night scion would be... simpler. He's just a rat in a trash heap."

Kaelen didn't speak. He calculated.

He looked at the terrain. The glass dune to his left. The pool of oil to his right. The rusted fan blades behind him.

_Variable 1: Pike. Reach advantage: 2 meters. Weakness: Haft durability. The user is over-extending his stride._
_Variable 2: Mace. Impact potential: High. Weakness: Recovery time. The user favors his right leg._
_Variable 3: Knife. Range: Short. Threat: Moderate. But he is standing in a depression. His footing is compromised._

They fanned out, flanking him. It was a standard triangular entrapment. Textbook Academy doctrine.

Kaelen sighed. It was a soft sound, lost in the wind.

"You are wasting my caloric intake," he said. His voice was flat, devoid of fear or bravado. It was just a statement of fact.

"We're going to waste a lot more than that, Night," the Pike-wielder lunged.

It was a probing strike, meant to test his reflexes. Kaelen saw it coming before the man's muscles even fully contracted. He saw the shift in weight. The tightening of the grip.

He moved.

He didn't dodge away; he dodged _in_.

He stepped into the arc of the pike, sliding inside the guard. The plasma tip hissed past his ear, close enough to singe his hood.

"Mistake," Kaelen whispered.

He slashed.

He didn't aim for the armor. Chrome-plated Durasteel was resistant to monofilament. He aimed for the joint.

The hydraulic line on the back of the Pike-man's knee was exposed for a fraction of a second as he lunged.

_Sever._

Black fluid sprayed. The leg seized. The servo screamed—a mechanical shriek of failure. The man collapsed, his leg locking straight, pitching him forward into the glass dune.

"Aaargh! My leg! He cut the line!"

The Mace-wielder reacted. He swung. It was a clumsy, angry blow, fueled by surprise.

Kaelen was already moving. He used _Shadow-Step_.

He didn't teleport. That was a myth. What he did was manipulate perception. He moved into the deep shadow of the fan blades, matching his speed to the saccadic masking of the human eye. To the Mace-wielder, Kaelen simply vanished.

"Where is he?"

"Behind you, idiot!" the Knife-man yelled.

Too late.

Kaelen dropped from the fan blade above. He landed on the Mace-wielder's shoulders. He was light, barely eighty kilos, but he used gravity.

He drove his knee into the seal between the helmet and the chest plate.

_CRUNCH._

The Mace-wielder staggered back, choking as the impact crushed his windpipe. He dropped the mace. It clattered on the glass.

Kaelen flipped off him, landing in a crouch.

Two down. Six seconds.

The third one—the Knife-man—scrambled back. His arrogance evaporated. He looked at Kaelen, then at his fallen squadmates.

"You... you're a monster, Night!"

Kaelen straightened. He cleaned his blade on his cloak.

"No," Kaelen said. "I am efficient. You are sloppy. You rely on your armor. You rely on your numbers. You forgot that in the dark, numbers don't matter."

He took a step forward.

The Knife-man dropped his weapon. He grabbed the wheezing Mace-wielder and dragged him away. The Pike-man unlocked his suit manual override and hobbled after them, cursing.

"Fear is a better messenger than a corpse," Kaelen said softly. "Leave."

He watched them retreat. He didn't blink. He waited until they were jagged silhouettes on the horizon, then nothing.

Only then did he let the mask slip.

He leaned against the rusted fan. His breath came in ragged hitches. His hand, the one holding the left blade, was trembling.

_Tremor magnitude: 4mm._
_Cause: Hypoglycemia. Adrenaline crash._

"Inefficient," he scolded himself. He holstered the blades.

He closed his eyes for a second, trying to center his breathing. Trying to force the biology to obey the will.

_Thwip._

It was a soft sound. Like a book closing in a library.

Kaelen heard it a fraction of a second too late. His sensors registered the displacement of air, but his body—the traitorous, tired biology—was too slow to react.

He twisted.

Something struck him in the neck.

It didn't penetrate the armor. It found the soft seal—the flexible synthetic weave between his helmet and his chest plate.

Pain.

Cold, absolute pain.

Kaelen ripped the object free. It was a dart. Black glass. Shattered.

The tip was wet with an iridescent, oily liquid.

It smelled like burning sugar and ozone.

_Prima-Materia._

Raw, unrefined magic. Industrial waste. In small doses, it caused hallucinations.

In a direct injection?

It was acid.

"Coward," Kaelen hissed, scanning the high ground.

A figure on a distant crane arm stood up. A silhouette against the grey sky. It held a long-rifle. It bowed mockingly—a theatrical, courtly bow—before vanishing into the gloom.

Kaelen tried to pursue. He took a step.

The world tilted.

The glass dunes didn't just shimmer; they began to scream.

Veins of black ink began to spread from the wound on his neck. They spiderwebbed down his chest and up his jaw, visible even through the visor reflection.

His heart rate spiked.

_Warning: Toxicity detected. Blood stream compromised. Foreign thaumaturgical agent._

He stumbled. His "Resonance"—the connection to the shadows that defined his fighting style—flickered. The shadows around him didn't welcome him; they recoiled. They pulled away, leaving him exposed in the harsh, grey light of the Slag-Heaps.

He was being rejected by his own element.

"No," he gritted his teeth. "Function. You must... function."

He dragged himself into the wreckage of a collapsed turbine housing. It was a rusted metal cave, dark and cold.

The walls of the turbine began to breathe.

The rust spots morphed. They didn't just become faces; they became a room.

He wasn't in the Slag-Heaps anymore. He was back in the Obsidian Hall. The floor was polished black marble, so cold it burned his bare feet. The air smelled of incense and blood.

He was ten years old.

"Stand up, Kaelen."

The voice was soft, cultured, and terrifying.

Lord Night—High Assassin of the Iron Council—stood by the window. He was watching the Foundry burn below. He didn't turn around.

"I cannot, Father," Kaelen whispered. His ten-year-old body was broken. His left arm was dislocated. His ribs were a lattice of fire.

"Cannot is a theoretical concept," Lord Night said. "Biology is a machine. Drive the machine."

"It hurts."

Lord Night turned. His face was a mask of perfect, icy disappointment.

"Pain is data," he said. "It is the sensor reporting damage. Acknowledging the sensor is necessary. Letting the sensor dictate your actions is a malfunction."

He walked over to Kaelen. He kicked Kaelen's dislocated arm.

_CRACK._

Kaelen screamed. It was a high, thin sound.

"Inefficient," Lord Night noted. "You wasted breath on noise. That breath could have been used to oxygenate your muscles. It could have been used to stand."

He crouched down. His eyes were like the black glass of the Slag-Heaps.

"Do you know why we are the Shadow, Kaelen?"

"Because... we serve the Iron," Kaelen sobbed.

"No," Lord Night wiped a tear from Kaelen's cheek with a thumb that felt like cold stone. "We are the Shadow because the Light is too heavy. The Iron King carries the weight of the world. We carry the weight of the things he cannot be seen doing."

He stood up.

"The Shadow does not break," Lord Night said. "It fades. It reforms. But it never breaks. Stand up."

Kaelen cried. He wanted to stay on the floor. The marble was cold. It was safe.

"Stand up," the voice became a weight. "Or I will authorize your deletion. I have other sons."

_Deletion._

The word was a hook. It pulled at Kaelen's spine.

He pushed against the floor with his good arm. He screamed inside his head, locking the sound behind his teeth. He forced his legs to work.

He stood. Swaying, broken, bleeding. But standing.

"Good," Lord Night nodded. "Now. Fix your arm."

Kaelen looked at his shoulder. The joint was wrong. It was sickeningly wrong.

"Fix. Your. Arm."

Kaelen grabbed his left wrist with his right hand. He closed his eyes.

He pulled.

_SNAP._

The world went white.

...

"I... did not break," Kaelen gasped in the turbine. "I... fixed it."

_You survived,_ the rust-face of his father sneered from the metal wall. _Survival is the lowest form of victory. Excellence is the only standard. And you... represent a deficit._

He activated his internal bio-monitor. The holographic display flickered in front of his eyes.

_Heart Rate: 40 BPM (Dropping)._
_Toxicity: 85%._
_Resonance Status: Critical Failure._

Kaelen closed his eyes.

He calculated the variables. Distance to medical bay: 4 kilometers. Travel time at current speed: Infinite.

Conclusion: Termination.

There was no fear. House Night did not breed fear. There was only a cold, bitter disappointment. He had failed the algorithm. He had prioritized the visible threat and ignored the hidden variable.

He was flawed.

"Weakness is death," he whispered the family mantra. It tasted like ash. "Weakness is authorized for deletion. Solitude... is the only truth."

He let his head fall back against the metal. The black veins were in his eyes now. The world was fading into a static-filled grey.

He waited for the deletion.

Time passed. It might have been minutes, or hours. The pain faded into a numb, cold void.

---

Ria hated the Slag-Heaps.

She hated the smell. She hated the way the ground tried to cut her boots. But mostly, she hated the silence.

"It's too quiet," she grumbled, kicking a piece of twisted rebar. "It's like the whole sector is holding its breath waiting for us to screw up."

"Maintain noise discipline," Angelica whispered over the comms. She was fifty meters ahead, scanning a pile of fused engine blocks. "My sensors are picking up chemical traces. Someone was here recently."

"Yeah, millions of people," Ria muttered. "It's a dump."

"No," Angelica corrected. "Specific traces. Plasma discharge. Hydraulic fluid. Blood."

Ria stopped kicking things. She unslung her heavy repeater, checking the ammo feed.

"Blood?" she asked. "Ours or theirs?"

"Unknown. The signature is degrading. But there's a lot of it."

Ria moved up to join Angelica. They found the scene of the fight.

It was a mess. A glass dune was shattered, looking like a bomb had gone off. There was a pool of black fluid—hydraulic oil—mixed with bright red blood on the sand.

"Someone had a bad day," Ria noted. She crouched down, touching the dented chest plate of a discarded piece of chrome armor. "Squad Silver. High-end kit. Someone took them apart."

"Look at the cuts," Angelica pointed to a severed hydraulic line on a piece of leg armor. "Surgical. Monofilament."

Ria felt a cold knot in her stomach.

"Kaelen," she said.

"He patrols here," Angelica said, her voice tight. "He splits off every rotation."

"If he took out a Silver squad, he's good," Ria said. Then she saw the second blood trail.

It wasn't red. It was black. Thicker. Oily.

"What is that?" Ria asked.

Angelica dipped a sensor probe into the black sludge. The readout flashed red.

"Prima-Materia," she whispered. "Highly concentrated. It's poison."

She looked at the trail. It led away from the fight. It was a drag mark. Someone crawling.

"He won," Angelica said. "But they got him."

"Where does the trail go?" Ria stood up, scanning the horizon.

"Into the turbine housing," Angelica pointed to the rusted hulk of machinery a hundred meters away. "It's a dead end."

Ria looked at the dark maw of the turbine. She thought about Kaelen. The way he looked at them like they were tools. The way he never slept. The way he was always, always alone.

"He's probably dead," Ria said.

"Then we recover the body," Angelica started walking.

"Why?" Ria asked, though she followed. "He wouldn't recover ours."

"We don't know that," Angelica said.

"I know it," Ria spat. "He's a machine, Angel. A killer."

"He's Squad Iron," Angelica said. And that was the end of the argument.

They reached the turbine. Angelica activated her light.

"I'm telling you, the sensor pinged here."

"Your sensors ping on rusty toasters, Runt. It's a trash heap. Everything pings."

"It was a bio-sign! A weird one. Like... dying."

Kaelen tried to move. He couldn't. His body was a statue of lead.

A boot kicked his leg.

"Hey! Wakey wakey!"

It was Ria. The Titan.

She leaned in, her faceplate glowing in the gloom. The light hurt his eyes.

"Whoa. He looks like leftovers."

"Ria!" Angelica pushed past her. The Runt dropped to her knees beside him. "Kaelen?"

Kaelen opened his eyes. All he saw was a blur of motion.

"Leave... me," he rasped. "Contagion."

"It's Prima-poisoning," Angelica said, her voice tight. She touched his neck, her fingers cool against the burning skin. "Fast-acting. The veins are already at his eyes."

Ria stood back, looking at the black lines spreading across Kaelen's face.

"He's gone, Angel," she said. Her voice wasn't cruel, just factual. "Look at him. That's deep rot. Even if he wakes up, the nerve damage... he'll be crippled. He won't be a Shadow anymore."

She looked at the exit.

"Leave him. He's House Night. He'd leave us in a heartbeat. He literally told us he would."

Angelica ignored her. She was scanning Kaelen with her datapad.

"His heart is stopping," she said. "The poison is coagulating the blood."

"Then let it stop," Ria said. "It's a mercy. We drag him back, we lose time. We enter the next Sector exhausted. We probably die too. Is he worth that? Is he _really_ worth that?"

Angelica stopped scanning. She looked at Kaelen.

She saw the arrogance. The coldness. The insults.

But she also saw the way he had stepped between her and the Chimera. The way he had taken the hit.

"He's part of the engine," Angelica said softly.

"What?" Ria asked.

"The squad," Angelica looked up. Her eyes were fierce. "It's an engine. You're the pistons. He's the gears. I'm the spark. If you throw away a gear because it's rusty, the engine breaks. We don't throw away parts until they are broken beyond repair."

"He IS broken beyond repair!" Ria shouted. "That's magic-rot! You can't fix that with a wrench!"

"I can fix anything," Angelica snapped.

She grabbed her pack. She pulled out a canister of "Solvent-4"—an industrial degreaser used for cleaning engine parts.

"That's for droids," Ria warned. "You inject that into a human, you'll dissolve his veins."

"His veins are already sludge," Angelica uncapped the solvent. "I need to thin the blood. Flush the system."

She leaned over Kaelen.

"Listen to me, Night," she whispered. "This is going to hurt. A lot. Try not to die."

She didn't have a syringe. She improvised. She used a pneumatic injector from her tool belt, dialing the pressure down.

She pressed it to his neck, right over the entry wound.

_HISS._

Kaelen convulsed.

His back arched off the floor. A sound tore from his throat—not a scream, but a guttural, animalistic snarl of agony.

"Hold him!" Angelica yelled.

Ria swore, but she moved. She pinned Kaelen's shoulders to the ground.

"You're crazy!" Ria yelled. "He's seizing!"

"It's working!" Angelica watched the veins. The black lines weren't receding, but they were stopping. The solvent was fighting the sludge.

But it wasn't enough. The poison was magical. Chemistry wasn't enough.

"Aeon!" Angelica screamed.

The mechanical owl gave a screech. It hopped from her shoulder, landing on Kaelen's chest. Its claws, usually retracted, gripped the armor plating.

"Eat it!" Angelica commanded.

"Eat poison?" The thought-form echoed in her mind. It wasn't a voice; it was a confused vibration. Aeon understood time. He understood entropy. Biology was messy.

"Eat the _energy_," Angelica focused. She felt the headache returning, the nosebleed starting again. She pushed past it. "The poison isn't just chemical. It's active. It has a frequency. Find the frequency... and silence it."

Aeon stared at the black veins. His blue eyes swirled, the aperture mechanism clicking as he zoomed in.

He saw it.

To the bird, the poison wasn't liquid. It was a chaotic, screaming pattern of violet light that was trying to rewrite the host's cells. It was an error in the code.

He pecked.

He pecked at the blackest part of the vein on Kaelen's neck.

There was a flash of blue light. Not a spark, but a pulse. A localized reversal of entropy.

Kaelen gasped. The black color seemed to drain out of the vein, sucked into the bird's beak. Aeon shuddered, his metal feathers ruffling as if he had tasted something foul.

_Taste: Bitter. Taste: Wrong._

"Keep eating!" Angelica yelled. "Don't stop!"

Aeon pecked again. And again.

Each peck drew out a wisp of black smoke—the metaphysical residue of the Prima-Materia.

Angelica kept the solvent flowing, the pneumatic injector hissing as it flushed the physical toxins. It was a gruesome, violent surgery. Blood and black sludge pooled on the floor, mixing with the rust.

Finally, Kaelen stopped thrashing. He went limp.

"He's dead," Ria whispered. The Titan looked pale. She had seen death before, but not like this. Not this... interactive.

Angelica checked the monitor. Her hands were shaking so hard she almost dropped the datapad.

_Heart Rate: 58 BPM (Stabilizing)._
_Toxicity: 15% (Clearing)._
_Resonance: Rebooting._

"No," Angelica wiped sweat—and blood—from her eyes. "He's rebooting."

She sat back, exhausted. Aeon hopped onto her shoulder and immediately vomited a small pellet of black glass—the condensed magical residue. It skittered across the floor, hissing.

"New rule," Ria stared at the bird, then at the pellet. "The bird does not eat off my plate. Ever."

Angelica ignored her. She looked at Kaelen. His color was returning. The black veins were fading to faint grey scars, like lightning burns.

"We have to move," Angelica said. She tried to stand, but her legs wobbled. The command to Aeon had cost her.

"You carried the team," Ria caught her arm, steadying her. "I'll carry the luggage."

Ria holstered her weapon. She bent down and scooped Kaelen up. Even in his armor, he looked small in her arms.

"He's lighter than he looks," Ria noted. "Hollow bones. Bird-man."

"Even gods bleed," Angelica murmured, looking at the pool of sludge on the floor. "And when they do, the sharks come. We aren't sharks, Ria. We're wolves."

"Wolves eat things too, Angel," Ria grunted, stepping out into the light.

"Yeah," Angelica followed. "But wolves hunt in a pack. Grab his legs."

"I got his whole body, Runt. Let's go."

They moved out of the Slag-Heaps, leaving the toxic nightmare behind.

---

The cave in Sector 6 was dry. That was the only good thing about it.

Angelica sat by the small, smokeless heater she had rigged from a spent fuel cell. The blue flame cast long, dancing shadows on the rock walls.

Ria was asleep, snoring softly against her pack.

Kaelen was awake.

He was sitting up, his back against the wall. His helmet was off. His face was pale, the lightning-burn scars on his neck and jaw standing out in stark relief against his skin.

He was staring at his hands. Flexing them. Open. Closed. Open. Closed.

"The tremor is gone," Angelica said softly, not looking up from the heater.

Kaelen didn't answer for a long moment. He looked at his hands, then at her.

"You used industrial solvent," he said. His voice was raspy, stripped raw by the screaming. "Solvent-4. It is corrosive to organic tissue."

"It's also the best thinning agent on the market," Angelica shrugged. "High risk, high reward. It flushed the sludge before it could crystalize in your heart."

Kaelen looked at her. His eyes were dark, unreadable pools.

"And the bird?" he asked. "What did the bird do?"

"He ate the magic," Angelica said simply. "Don't ask me how. I don't think he knows either. He just... deleted it."

Kaelen looked at Aeon, who was perched on a rock, sleeping with one eye open.

"I owe you a life debt," Kaelen said. It wasn't a thank you. It was a transaction statement. "House Night pays its debts."

"I don't want your money, Kaelen," Angelica said. She finally looked at him. "And I don't want your debt."

"Then what do you want?"

"I want you to stop trying to die," she said.

Kaelen blinked. He looked genuinely confused.

"I do not try to die," he said stiffly. "I calculate risk."

"You calculate _deletion_," Angelica corrected. "I saw your monitor logs. You gave up. You sat in that turbine and waited for the lights to go out."

"I was compromised," Kaelen said defensively. "Efficiency demanded—"

"Screw efficiency," Angelica snapped. "We aren't machines, Kaelen. Even if you want to be. Machines don't bleed. Machines don't hallucinate."

She leaned forward.

"You were scared," she said. "It's okay to be scared."

Kaelen looked away. He looked at the shadows dancing on the wall. For a moment, they looked like the faces in the turbine. But then the fire flared, and they were just shadows again.

"I was not scared," he whispered. "I was... disappointed."

"In what?"

"In myself," he said. "My father says weakness is a choice."

"Your father sounds like a jerk," Angelica said. She threw a nutrient bar at him. He caught it instinctively.

Kaelen looked at the bar, shocked. Then, a ghost of a smile touched his lips. It was gone instantly, but it was there.

"Yes," he agreed. "He is extremely efficient."

He opened the bar.

"My brothers were efficient," he said quietly. "There were four of us. I am the only one who passed the Shadow Trials. The others... were deleted."

Angelica froze.

"Deleted?"

"Removed from the line of succession," Kaelen took a bite. "It is the way. The Night House does not tolerate redundancy."

Angelica looked at him with a new kind of horror. It wasn't the monsters in the dark he feared. It was the empty chair at the dinner table.

"Well," she said, poking the fire. "We're redundant. Ria and me. We're just slum trash. So I guess we fit right in."

Kaelen masticated slowly. He swallowed.

"No," he said. "You are not redundant. You are variables. Unpredictable variables."

He leaned his head back.

"Thank you," he said. "For the solvent. And the wolf pack."

"You heard that?"

"I hear everything," Kaelen closed his eyes. "Even when I am rebooting."

The cave went silent, save for the hum of the heater and Ria's snoring.

For the first time since the Selection began, Kaelen Night slept. And he didn't dream of deletion.

**Academy Monitor Station 4: The Gilded Cage**

The Monitor Room smelled of ozone and filtered air. It was a circular chamber, lined with ten thousand screens, each one a window into the hellscape of the Selection.

Dr. Aris sat in the center, suspended in a gravity-chair that allowed him to rotate and view any feed with a flick of his wrist. He was a small man, mostly cybernetic implants wrapped in expensive silk. He had replaced his eyes with multi-spectrum optical sensors years ago. He claimed it was for "clarity." Everyone else knew it was because he simply hated blinking.

He was bored.

"Squad Gold," he muttered, spinning his chair. "Efficiency: 94%. Casualties: Zero. Boring."

He swiped the screen away.

"Squad Copper," he spun again. "Dead. Eaten by a tunnel-worm in Sector 9. Predictable."

He tapped a console. A drone refilled his glass of nutrient solution. He sipped it through a copper straw.

"Where is the anomaly?" he whispered. "Where is the variance?"

The Selection was supposed to be a crucible. A test of adaptability. But this year, the batches were... standard. The High Houses sent their vat-grown soldiers. The slums sent their desperate brawlers. The variables were known. The outcomes were calculated to the third decimal point.

Aris hated calculation. He wanted surprise.

_Ping._

A red alert flashed on Screen 412.

_Subject: Kaelen Night._
_Status: Critical._
_Location: Sector 4 (Slag-Heaps)._

Aris spun the chair. He maximized the feed.

He saw the boy—the Night scion—lying in the rusted turbine. He saw the black veins.

"Prima-Materia intoxication," Aris noted, his voice recording automatically to the log. "High concentration. Source: Injection. Prognosis: Termination."

He zoomed in. He saw the sensor data overlay.

_Heart Rate: 40 BPM._
_Organ Failure: Liver, Kidneys, Neural Cortex._

"He's dead," Aris said. He felt a pang of disappointment. Kaelen Night had potential. His stealth metrics were in the top 1 percentile. But biology was fragile. "Another glass cannon shattered."

He ordered the system to prepare the death certificate. He was about to switch feeds—Squad Emerald was engaging a mimic-beast in the Cryo-vats—when the data spiked.

_Heart Rate: 120 BPM._
_Foreign Chemical Agent Detected._

Aris paused.

"Solvent?" he squinted at the readout. "Industrial degreaser? Who puts floor cleaner in a vein?"

He watched the feed. He saw the girl. Angelica Ward. The Runt.

She was holding the pneumatic injector. Her face was set in a mask of desperate focus.

"Crude," Aris sneered. "Ineffective. You can't flush magic with chemistry, girl. You're just pickling the corpse."

But then... the bird moved.

Aris had noted the mechanical owl before. A Class-2 construct. Impressive for a slum-tech, but essentially a sophisticated drone.

Or so he thought.

The bird landed on the boy's chest. It pecked.

A flash of blue light saturated the camera feed.

"Visual interference," Aris muttered, adjusting the gain.

But it wasn't interference.

The sensors screamed.

_Energy Spike: Unknown Wavelength._
_Entropy Reversal Detected._
_Prima-Materia Signature: Null._

"Null?" Aris grabbed the arms of his chair. "Not 'Degraded'? Not 'Dispersed'? Null?"

He watched the black veins on the boy's neck. They didn't fade; they _retreated_. As if the ink was being sucked back into the pen.

The bird was eating it.

No, Aris realized with a jolt of pure scientific ecstasy. The bird wasn't eating the poison. It was eating the _event_. It was consuming the timeline where the poison existed.

"Chronos-phage," Aris whispered the forbidden word. "She built a chronos-phage."

He watched the boy stabilize. He watched the black residue—a physical impossibility—get expelled by the construct.

Aris sat back. His heart was beating faster than the dying boy's.

This was it. The Variance. The Anomaly.

He saved the footage. He encrypted it with a triple-key cipher that only he possessed.

Then, he opened the official report.

_Subject: Kaelen Night._
_Incident: Poisoning._
_Outcome: Survived natural immunity._

He typed the lie without hesitation. If Prelate Vane saw this—if the Iron Council saw this—they would dissect the girl and her bird before the sun set. And Aris didn't want them dissected. Not yet.

He wanted to see what they would do.

"You are not a mechanic, Angelica Ward," Aris smiled, his optical sensors whirring as they zoomed in on her tired, blood-streaked face. "You are a god-maker."

He opened a new file.

_Project: Genesis. Phase 2._

"Play on, little wolf," Aris whispered. "The game just got interesting."

**Scene 7: The Deep Dream**

Angelica drifted.

Sleep in the Slag-Heaps wasn't rest; it was just a pause in the survival process. But this time, the exhaustion went deeper than muscle and bone. It went into the marrow of her soul.

She floated in a dark ocean.

The water wasn't water. It was static. White noise made liquid.

She tried to swim, but her limbs were heavy, made of lead and rust.

*Down.*

Something was pulling her.

She looked down into the abyss.

There were gears turning in the dark. Massive, continent-sized cogs that ground against each other with the sound of tectonic plates shifting. They were made of brass and bone.

*Click. Whir. Snap.*

The Engine of the World.

And on one of the gears, a bird was perched.

It wasn't Aeon. It was too big. It was a constellation of blue stars shaped like an owl. Its eyes were burning suns.

It looked at her.

**"THE SPARK IS SMALL,"** the voice boomed. It didn't come from the bird; it came from the gears. **"BUT IT BURNS HOT."**

Angelica tried to speak. bubbles of code escaped her mouth.

**"DO NOT FIX WHAT IS NOT BROKEN, LITTLE MAKER,"** the voice rumbled. **"ENTROPY IS NECESSARY. DECAY IS FUEL."**

The bird spread its wings. The stars flared.

**"THE NIGHT IS COMING. AND YOU HAVE LIT A BEACON."**

A massive, shadowed hand rose from the depths. It was made of oil and void-stuff. It reached for the bird.

"Aeon!" Angelica screamed.

She reached out. Her hand wasn't flesh anymore. It was silver. It was chrome. It was the hand of a machine god.

She grabbed the void-hand.

*CONTACT.*

Pain exploded in her mind. Not the pain of a burn, but the pain of *knowing*. She saw the code of the hand. She saw the variables.

*Variable: Hunger.*
*Attribute: Infinite.*
*Name: The Alpha.*

**"INTERESTING,"** the voice laughed. The sound was breaking glass.

Angelica woke up.

She sat up with a gasp, her hand clutching her chest.

The cave was quiet. The heater hummed. Ria was still snoring.

Angelica looked at her hand. It was just flesh. Dirt under the fingernails. A callous on the thumb from turning wrenches.

But it felt heavy.

She looked at Aeon. The owl was awake. He was staring at her with his unblinking blue eyes.

"What did you see?" Angelica whispered to the bird.

Aeon tilted his head.

"I saw the gears," he chirped softly. A vocalization he had never made before.

Anyelica shivered. She pulled her blanket tighter.

"Go to sleep, bird," she murmured. "Tomorrow we have to walk."

She lay back down. But she didn't close her eyes. She watched the shadows on the ceiling, waiting for them to turn into hands.
