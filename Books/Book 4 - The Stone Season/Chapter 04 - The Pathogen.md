### Scene 1: The Vial (The Sample)

- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris reveals the "Pathogen" sample to Angelica in his makeshift lab.
- **Detailed Description:** In a repurposed janitorial closet on Level 400, Dr. Aris has established a makeshift field laboratory. The space is cramped, smelling of ozone and stale air. The only illumination comes from chemical glow-sticks taped to the walls, casting a sickly green light over the rusted shelves. Aris holds up a reinforced glass vial. Inside, a black, viscous liquid swirls with unnatural autonomy, pressing against the glass as if testing its prison. It absorbs the ambient light rather than reflecting it, creating a small void in the room. Aris handles the vial with a mixture of reverence and terror, his hands shaking slightly until he activates the gyroscopic stabilizer on his wrist.
- **Internal Conflict:** Aris battles his own pride. He recognizes the genius of the design—the elegance of the protein strings—but is horrified by its application. He wants to study it, to unlock its secrets, but he knows it represents the end of humanity as he knows it. He feels the seductive pull of forbidden knowledge. Angelica watches him closely, realizing that Aris is as dangerous as the virus because he admires it. She sees the hunger in his eyes, a reflection of the hunger in the vial.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Vane called it the 'Cure'. He believed it would rewrite the human genome to survive the Void. He wanted to strip us down to our most efficient parts. No waste. No hesitation. Just function."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It looks like oil. It looks dead. Put it down, Aris."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It looks like oil. It looks dead. Put it down, Aris."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Oh, no. It is very, very alive. It is aggressive life. It consumes entropy."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** (Peering through her lorgnette) "It has a fascinating lattice structure, doesn't it? Like a diamond with a pulse. Be a dear and don't drop it, Doctor. I'd hate to have to shoot you."

### Scene 2: The Explanation (The Lizard Brain)

- **Key Event:** Aris explains the biological mechanism of the virus.
- **Detailed Description:** Aris activates a portable holoprojector, displaying a rotating simulation of a human brain. As he speaks, the simulation highlights the frontal cortex in blue. The virus, represented by red tendrils, attacks the cortex, causing it to wither and turn grey. The cortex—the seat of personality, memory, empathy, and inhibition—is dissolved. The virus then stimulates the basal ganglia and the brainstem—the "Lizard Brain." These areas glow an angry, pulsing red. The simulation shows the subject's adrenaline production spiking by 400%, turning the body into a biological engine of destruction.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen watches the simulation with growing horror. To him, the mind is sacred. The Night House taught him that discipline and control were the highest virtues. The idea of being reduced to a mindless animal is a fate worse than death. He grips the hilt of his sword, his knuckles white. He imagines fighting opponents who look like people—who might _be_ people he knows—but act like rabid beasts. He questions whether he can kill them.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — Identifies the loss of personality/humanity as murder. He realizes that killing a "Blighted" is not killing a person, but ending a desecration.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "What is left when you remove the soul? The Lizard Brain. The basal ganglia. Hunger. Rage. Speed. It removes the hesitation of morality. It solves the caloric equation of 'conscience'."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It removes the person. It's murder. You're talking about hollow shells."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "I'm talking about survival machines. Vane didn't want citizens; he wanted sharks. Sharks don't mourn."

### Scene 3: The Failure (Subject 104)

- **Key Event:** The group watches security footage of an early experiment.
- **Detailed Description:** Aris plays a recovered security log on a cracked monitor. The timestamp is from three years ago. The grainy footage shows a sterile containment cell. Inside, a man in a Zenith uniform—"Subject 104"—is convulsing on a cot. His skin begins to turn grey and mottled, like wet cement. His veins turn black, visible through the paling skin. Suddenly, the convulsions stop. He stands up. His movements are unnatural—jerky, too fast, like a marionette with cut strings. He turns to the camera. His eyes are entirely black, the sclera consumed by the virus. He throws himself at the reinforced glass. He doesn't scream; he hisses. He punches the glass repeatedly. The audio picks up the sound of bones snapping, but he doesn't stop. He hammers the glass with shattered hands until the feed cuts to static.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria feels a chill run down her spine. She respects strength, but this is mindless. The creature on the screen has no technique, no honor. It is just a biological weapon. She looks at her own cybernetic arm, wondering if her own enhancements make her similar to this thing—a weapon made of meat. She feels a deep revulsion for the lack of control.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "He doesn't recognize the scientists anymore. He doesn't recognize himself. He only sees heat sources. Meat. He broke three bones in his hand and didn't even slow down."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "So we're fighting zombies. Fast, angry zombies. Great. I hate fast zombies."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "They aren't zombies. They're animals. Put them down like animals."

### Scene 4: The Warning (Heat Seekers)

- **Key Event:** Aris warns about the Blighted's sensory adaptation.
- **Detailed Description:** Aris explains that because the higher brain functions are gone, the Blighted rely on primal senses. They are effectively blind to visible light but possess heightened thermal sensitivity. They hunt by thermal signature and movement. He points to the ventilation ducts above them, where warm air from the ship's failing reactor still circulates. "They are attracted to heat," he whispers. "And we are the only warm things left in this freezing ship."
- **Internal Conflict:** The group realizes their vulnerability. In the freezing cold of the Stone Season, their body heat, their campfires, their very existence is a beacon. They are glowing targets in the dark. Angelica looks at the survivors huddled around a chemical heater nearby. They are ringing the dinner bell. She feels the weight of leadership—she has to tell them to be cold to stay alive.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Do not aim for the head. The brain is redundant. You have to sever the spine or burn the heart. They don't feel pain. They don't feel fear. They only feel hunger."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Then we need to be cold. We need to be quiet. And we need to be ready. Kill the heaters. Now."

### Scene 5: The First Contact (The Ventilation Shaft)

- **Key Event:** A scratching sound is heard in the vents.
- **Detailed Description:** As Angelica orders the heaters off, a sound echoes from the metal ductwork overhead. _Scritch. Scritch._ It sounds like claws on steel. The group freezes. Zephyr raises his blaster, the hum of its capacitor the only sound in the room. A vent cover rattles. Then, silence. The silence is heavy, predatory. Aris checks his thermal scanner. "Contact," he whispers. "Multiple contacts. They're in the walls."
- **Internal Conflict:** Fear ripples through the group. They are trapped in a small room with monsters in the walls. Angelica forces herself to breathe. She cannot panic. If she panics, they die. She signals Kaelen to take the door.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "They're in the walls? I hate when they're in the walls."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Steady. Let them come to us."
