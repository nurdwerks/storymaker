# Chapter 13: Ria's Decline

---

### Scene 1: The Symptom

- **Key Event:** Ria’s cybernetic joints begin to seize due to "rusting"—a biological-technical fungus that eats the seals of Undercity machinery.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Attempts to hide the tremor in her hands, viewing her malfunction as a sign of weakness.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "It's just the cold. My servos are sluggish. I don't need a diagnostic."

### Scene 2: The Diagnosis

- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris forced a scan on Ria, revealing that the fungal spores are integrating with her organic nervous system through the neural ports.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "It's not just rust. It's a bio-mechanical parasite. It's using your power supply to replicate. If we don't excise the plating, it will hit your spine."

### Scene 3: The Choice

- **Key Event:** Ria must choose between a slow, agonizing "seizure" or a radical surgery that will leave her mostly unarmored and vulnerable.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Pleads with Ria to accept the help, offering to use her own nanites to stabilize the infection.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "You're not a machine, Ria. You're my sister. Don't let the metal kill the person."

### Scene 4: The Surgery

- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris performs the field surgery with a soldering iron and a dirty scalpel while the group guards the room from scavengers.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Refuses sedation, wanting to see the "rot" being removed so she remembers the cost.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "No sleep. Watch the work. I want to see what's left when the armor comes off."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You're still Ria. Even without the chrome. Remember that."
