## Chapter 11: Blackmail

### Scene 1: The Showers

- **Key Event:** Angelica is washing in the communal showers when the water shuts off. Ria enters fully clothed in armored vest and combat boots.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Feels small, exposed, and vulnerable while Ria looms over her like a tank in a flower garden.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Nice trick in the dojo, Ward. You made quite a mess."

---

### Scene 2: The Leverage

- **Key Event:** Ria reveals she saw the dented lockers—three hundred pounds of steel bent like tin foil—and identifies it as raw kinetic displacement without a focus.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I know what kinetic displacement looks like. You didn't use a spell. You just... pushed. You used pure will."

- **Key Event:** Ria threatens to report Angelica to Vane. Freaks get sent to the "Special" wing—the dissection labs—and don't come back.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You know what they do to freaks in the Zenith? They send them to the 'Special' wing. The dissection labs. And they don't come back."

### Scene 3: The Deal

- **Key Event:** Instead of blackmail, Ria reveals she's failing Theoretical Resonance. If she fails the final, she gets recycled to Infantry or the Mines.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Shows genuine fear for the first time, not cruelty but desperation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I can punch through a wall, but I can't calculate the frequency of the shield I'm punching."

- **Key Event:** Ria proposes a deal: Angelica tutors her and does her homework; in exchange, Ria protects Angelica from Toro's goons and other threats.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You tutor me. You make sure I pass. And I make sure the other squads don't break your fingers."

- **Key Event:** Angelica recognizes it as a symbiotic relationship—she's a glass cannon (powerful but fragile); Ria is a fortress with no artillery.

### Scene 4: The Pact

- **Key Event:** Angelica extends her hand. Ria grabs it—her hand heavy, grey, cold like shaking hands with a statue due to her Steel-Hide bond.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Deal."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't screw this up, Ward. Or I'll break you myself. I won't let them recycle me."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They won't. I can fix anything. Even your grades."

- **Key Event:** As Ria leaves, she turns the water back on for Angelica—hot. A tiny kindness in a cold world.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'll keep them off your back. You keep me in the class. We survive together."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't get sentimental, Silt-Rat. It's just business."
