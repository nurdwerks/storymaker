## Chapter 08: The Ghost Signal

### Scene 1: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** The _Zenith_'s long-range communication array, which has been silent for three hundred years, suddenly lights up. A massive, encrypted data packet slams into the ship's receiver buffer, overwhelming the local systems with recursive code.
- **Detailed Description:** The main console on the bridge erupts with red alert sigils. The holographic display fractures into a kaleidoscope of static and alien glyphs. The sound is a piercing electronic shriek that forces the crew to cover their ears. Lisbet, plugged into the comms station, convulses as the feedback hits her neural implants. Her goggles spark, and she tears them off, revealing eyes dilated with shock.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a spike of paranoia. In the Dark Forest, a signal is not a greeting; it is a weapon. She orders a hard cut on the receiver, but the signal has already bypassed the firewalls. It is inside the ship's brain.

- **Key Event:** Figment, Lisbet's bonded AI companion, manifests as a holographic avatar to intercept the signal. He identifies a "Logic Virus" embedded in the transmission—a code designed to enslave the ship's navigation computer.
- **Detailed Description:** Figment's usually playful avatar flickers, his edges turning jagged. He expands his code to create a quarantine "sandbox" around the incoming data. The virus fights back, eating away at Figment's integrity. His voice distorts, shifting between octaves. He explains that the only way to sanitize the map hidden in the signal is to let the virus consume him, trapping it in his own dying code.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet screams for him to stop, trying to physically unplug the console. She loves Figment more than most humans. Losing him is like losing a limb. But Figment overrides her lockout. He chooses to die to save the ship.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Devastated by the loss of Figment, her AI companion, she collapses as his avatar disintegrates into static. She questions if the destination is worth the cost of her only friend.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Figment:** "It's been real, Liz. Or... you know. Whatever reality is. Don't forget to defrag."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "He's gone. He ate the virus. He's just... null data now."

### Scene 2: The Map

- **Key Event:** With the virus neutralized, the data packet unspools on the main viewscreen. It reveals a highly detailed star map pointing to a single star system: "Sanctuary."
- **Detailed Description:** The map is beautiful. It shows a yellow sun, similar to Sol, with a single habitable planet in the Goldilocks zone. The planet is green and blue, possessing oceans and continents. Coordinates scroll along the bottom: "Destination Confirmed. Trajectory Locked. Welcome Home."
- **Internal Conflict:** The bridge crew stares in awe. For generations, "Earth 2.0" was a myth, a religious promise used to control the masses. Now, it is a picture on a screen. Some weep. Others pray. Angelica feels only suspicion. It is too perfect. Too easy.

- **Key Event:** The crew is immediately divided over whether to follow the map. General Ironwood sees it as a divine mandate to reclaim their birthright, while Kaelen Night argues it is a trap set by the entities hunting them.
- **Detailed Description:** Ironwood stands tall, his mechanical eye zooming in on the green planet. He sees resources, land, and conquest. He pounds the table, demanding they alter course immediately. Kaelen stands opposite him, arms crossed, his shadow flickering with unease. He points out that the signal was weaponized. Friendly neighbors don't send viruses with their invitations.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica is torn. The ship is dying; they need a home. But Kaelen's logic is sound. If something is hunting them, a lure is exactly what it would use. She has to decide whether to risk the trap for the cheese.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Displays religious-like fervor for the "Founders" and the idea of reclaiming Earth 2.0. He views caution as cowardice in the face of destiny.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "It's Earth 2.0. It's what we were promised. It's what the Zenith was built to find. We did not survive the void to turn away from paradise!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "A lighthouse warns you of rocks. Or, if the keeper is a bastard, it guides you to the wreckers. That isn't a map, General. It's a mouth."

### Scene 3: The Vote

- **Key Event:** Angelica calls for a vote among the senior staff, adhering to the democratic principles she established after the fall of Vane.
- **Detailed Description:** The tension in the room is palpable. Hatcher votes to investigate, arguing that they are running out of supplies anyway. Ria votes with Ironwood, driven by a desire for a world where she doesn't have to wear armor. Lisbet, still grieving, abstains. Kaelen votes no. It comes down to Angelica.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica looks at the map. She thinks of Leo, who died for a chance at a life outside the dome. She thinks of the thousands of sleepers in cryo who need a planet. She decides that the risk of a trap is better than the certainty of slow starvation in the void.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We investigate. But we go in silent. Shields up, weapons hot. If it's a trap, we spring it on our terms."
