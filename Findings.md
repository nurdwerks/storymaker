| Angelica Vance   | 1     | 1/2     | The profile states she was caught hacking in Chapter 1. In the text, she decides to hack in Chapter 1 but is actually caught and blackmailed by Vane in Chapter 2. This is a minor timing discrepancy.                                                                                               |
| Angelica Vance   | 1     | 24      | The profile mentions the "Berry Gambit" and a threat to blow up the arena. The chapter summary describes a broadcast and a system hack, but does not explicitly mention "berries" or an explosion threat.                                                                                            |

The chapter summary for Ch 24 describes a fight with cyborgs and Captain Thorne's sacrifice instead. |
| Angelica Vance   | 3     | 25      | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** The profile implies Leo's death at the Palace triggers her transformation. Chapter 25 summary (Leo's End) has Leo die from a sniper shot while holding a door in Sector 10. "The Carving" is not mentioned.                                                                   |
| Leo Vance        | 3     | 24/25   | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** Profile says Duke Grey kills him with a sword at a "Red Wedding" (Palace). Text has him killed by a sniper while holding a door (Sector 10).                                                                                                                                  |
| Angelica Vance   | 4     | 28      | **DISCREPANCY:** Profile says "The Mother" offers a world without pain/Utopia.

| Kaelen Night     | 1     | 5       | **TIMING DISCREPANCY:** The profile refers to the bridge incident (saving Angelica) as a "Pre-Book 1" inciting incident.
