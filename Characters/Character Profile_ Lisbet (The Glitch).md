# Character Profile: Lisbet (The Glitch)

**Archetype:** The Hacker / The Tech-Witch / The Anarchist **True Sin:** LUST (Not exclusively sexual, but a desperate, dopamine-fueled craving for *Sensation*, *Connection*, and *Stimulus*. She is an addict of the "Rush"—the moment the firewall breaks, the moment the data floods in. She hacks because reality is too quiet and too lonely). **Virtue Mask:** TEMPERANCE (She projects a persona of cold, robotic logic and physical distance. She acts like she hates people and prefers machines to hide the terrifying truth: she is touch-starved and desperate for a hug she cannot survive).

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Living Circuit

Lisbet looks like a piece of technology that has been voided of its warranty. She is small, vibrating with nervous energy, and visibly damaged by the Resonance she channels.

### 1. The Wire-Frame Body

- **Stature:** She is tiny, standing barely 5'1". Her growth was likely stunted by malnutrition in the Mid-Levels and the caloric demands of her brain. She is waif-like, sharp elbows and knees, easily lost in a crowd. She uses this smallness to slip into ventilation shafts and server racks where others cannot fit.

- **The Skin:** Her skin is pale, almost translucent, but covered in **Lichtenberg Figures**—fern-like branching scars caused by high-voltage electrical discharges. These scars glow faint neon-blue when she is active.

- **The "Circuit" Tattoos:** To mask the scars, she has tattooed over them with conductive ink. The ink forms intricate circuit diagrams running up her neck, down her arms, and across her scalp. When she channels, the ink heats up, making her look like a living motherboard.

- **Hair:** She keeps her hair shaved on the sides to accommodate her neural jacks. The top is a mop of chemically dyed neon-blue hair that stands up on end due to the constant static charge in her bio-field.

### 2. The Eyes of the Stream

- **The Goggles:** She is rarely seen without a pair of oversized, modified welding goggles pushed up on her forehead or covering her eyes. They have multiple lenses (macro, thermal, data-overlay).

- **The Twitch:** Her eyes dart constantly, tracking data streams that only she can see via her neural link. Even when looking at a person, she is focusing on the "metadata" floating around them. Her pupils are permanently dilated, giving her a manic, drug-induced look.

### 3. The Static Field (Physiological Toll)

Lisbet’s body generates a constant, low-level electromagnetic field.

- **The Spark:** If she moves too fast, static electricity arcs between her fingers. Dust motes dance around her.

- **The Effect on Tech:** Cheap electronics glitch when she walks by. Lights flicker. Screens fuzz. She is a walking EMP risk. This makes stealth difficult for her in the Zenith, where everything is automated.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Lisbet dresses for insulation and utility. Her wardrobe is a mix of cyberpunk street-wear and safety gear.

- **The Oversized Gear:** She wears clothes three sizes too big. Baggy cargo pants with endless pockets, oversized hoodies. This is a psychological defense—hiding her small, vulnerable body inside a fortress of fabric.

- **The Rubber Coat:** Her signature item is a heavy, transparent raincoat made of industrial-grade insulating rubber. It is yellow and stained with grease. She wears it not for rain, but to prevent accidental skin contact with others. It is her barrier against the world.

- **The Gloves:** She wears thick, fingerless rubber gloves. The fingertips are exposed for typing, but the palms are shielded.

- **The Deck:** Strapped to her lower back is her "Deck"—a portable, custom-built computer rig made from scavenged Zenith consoles, a toaster, and a car battery. It looks like junk, but it can crack a Bank of Aeterna vault in under sixty seconds.

- **The Headphones:** Massive, noise-canceling headphones around her neck. She blasts "Undercity Bass" (industrial techno) to drown out the "hum" of the city's power grid, which she hears constantly.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Lisbet is a study in ADHD energy and avoidance behaviors.

- **The Flinch:** If anyone makes a sudden move toward her, she flinches violently. This isn't just trauma; it is a conditioned response. She knows that if they touch her, she will shock them, and they will get angry/hurt. She flinches to protect *them* from *her*.

- **The Tapping:** She constantly taps complex rhythms on her thighs, walls, or her keyboard. She is tapping code (binary or morse). It helps her organize her thoughts.

- **Deconstruction:** If left alone in a room for five minutes, she will disassemble something. A pen, a remote control, a weapon. She needs to see how things work. She often forgets to put them back together.

- **No Eye Contact:** She finds eye contact overwhelming (too much data). She looks at people's mouths, their hands, or the wall behind them.

- **"Glitching":** When she is stressed, she stutters or repeats words, mimicking a skipping hard drive. "I-I-I-I don't think that's a good idea."

## IV. The Bond: Static and The Touch Toll

Lisbet’s magic is the power of the Information Age, but it costs her the most primal human need: connection.

- **The Beast:** **Static** (The Voltaic Eel).

  - **Appearance:** Static is a construct of pure blue electricity and plasma. It has no solid form; it lives inside the conduits of the ship or inside Lisbet’s own nervous system. When it manifests overtly, it looks like a serpent made of lightning coiling around her arms.

  - **Personality:** Static is chaotic, hungry, and playful. It wants to jump, to arc, to burn. It whispers impulses to Lisbet: *Touch it. Break it. Overload it.*

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Covert Manifestation:** **Technopathy**. Lisbet can "talk" to machines. She doesn't type code; she *thinks* it. She can unlock doors, loop cameras, and crash drones by touching them or being near them.

  - **Overt Manifestation:** **Discharge**. She can fire bolts of lightning from her hands. She can fry a person’s nervous system or jump-start a generator.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Touch (The Hedgehog’s Dilemma).**

  - *The Cost:* To house the Voltaic energy, her skin is permanently charged. She cannot touch another living thing without shocking them. A casual brush is a static sting; a hug causes second-degree burns; a kiss would stop a heart.

  - *The Horror:* She craves intimacy (Lust). She watches friends hug and hold hands with a hunger that eats her alive. She is trapped in a glass box of her own power. Her Mask of **Temperance** is the lie that she doesn't want to be held.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

Lisbet grew up in the **Mid-Levels**, in the crawlspaces between the walls. She has no surname because she never knew her parents. She was raised by the grid.

- **The Street Rat:** She survived by hacking vending machines for food and splicing power cables to warm her nest. She was a ghost in the machine.

- **The Mentor:** She met **Detective Hatcher** when she was twelve. She tried to hack his datapad to erase a jaywalking ticket. He caught her. Instead of arresting her, he bought her a burger.

- **The Discovery:** Hatcher realized she was a Resonance sensitive. He became her protector. Because Hatcher is a **Null** (Severed Bond), he has a higher resistance to Resonance effects. He discovered that if he wore a thick rubber coat, he could sit back-to-back with her without getting burned. He became the only physical contact she had.

- **The Recruitment:** She works as an information broker for **Zephyr**. Zephyr provides the hardware; she provides the unlock codes. They have a "Sibling" dynamic—he protects her body, she protects his digital footprint.

**The Inciting Incident (Book 2):** Lisbet isn't dragged into the plot; she hacks her way in. When she sees Angelica’s bounty pop up on the Zephyr's feed, she recognizes the code patterns in the bounty hunter network are *wrong*. She realizes it's a setup before anyone else. She joins the group because the "Code is broken," and she has a compulsion to fix broken things.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 2: The Cipher of Sins — ***The Script Kiddie***

- **State:** Lisbet is an anarchist. She hates the Zenith/Empire because they hoard the bandwidth. She joins Angelica for the thrill (Lust for Chaos).

- **The Action:** She hacks the "Eye" surveillance system. This is her first major act of war.

- **The Toll:** To break the military encryption, she has to channel more voltage than her body can handle. The circuits on her skin glow white-hot. She suffers third-degree burns on her arms (Sacrifice).

- **The Interaction:** Angelica tries to bandage her. Lisbet flinches, screaming, "Don't touch me!" Hatcher has to step in with rubber gloves. Angelica realizes the tragedy of the girl who can connect to everything but people.

### Book 3: The Game of Gears — ***The Spy***

- **State:** Lisbet is the eyes and ears of the Rebellion. She lives in the walls of the Palace (literally).

- **The Conflict:** She uncovers **Lady Vesper’s** plot before anyone else. She tries to warn Angelica, but **Cromwell** blocks the signal.

- **The Isolation:** While everyone else is attending balls and banquets, Lisbet is eating cold nutrient paste in a ventilation shaft. Her Envy/Lust for inclusion spikes. She watches the parties through the security cameras, imagining she is dancing.

- **The Climax:** During the **Obsidian Banquet**, Lisbet overrides the locking mechanism on the doors, allowing **Kaelen** to escape with Angelica. She burns out the Palace’s main server, plunging the massacre into darkness, saving lives by creating confusion.

### Book 4: The Stone Season — ***The Heater***

- **State:** In the freezing darkness of the Foundation, Lisbet is invaluable. She is a living battery.

- **The Role:** She jump-starts the heaters. She keeps the lights on. Survivors huddle around her for warmth, but they have to stay three feet away. She is the campfire that burns if you get too close.

- **The Loss:** **Hatcher** dies holding the door. Lisbet watches it happen on her datapad feed. She cannot save him.

- **The Breakdown:** Hatcher was her anchor. Without him, her static flares out of control. She overloads, shorting out the lights in the camp. She screams in the dark, a raw, digital shriek of grief. Zephyr has to talk her down from a distance, promising he won't leave her (even though his counter is at zero).

### Book 5: The Silent Void — ***The Translator***

- **State:** On the Ship, Lisbet is the first to understand the hardware. She interfaces with the **Ship AI**.

- **The Discovery:** She decodes the "Do Not Answer" signal. She realizes the **Dark Forest** nature of the universe. The Alien code is elegant, efficient, and terrifying. It seduces her.

- **The Temptation:** The Ship AI offers to upload her consciousness. "No more body. No more pain. Just data." It appeals to her Lust for connection without the Sacrifice of touch.

- **The Choice:** She considers it. But then she looks at Zephyr, struggling with his dead arm. She chooses the messy, painful meat-world because her friends are there. She rejects the upload.

### Book 6: The Architect of Time — ***The Architect’s Hands***

- **State:** Lisbet stays in the future timeline with Ria and Kaelen.

- **The Role:** She keeps the ship running. She patches the life support with code and duct tape. She builds the **Time-Window** that allows them to see Angelica in the past.

- **The Growth:** She stops being a "Glitch" and becomes the System Admin. She learns to control her voltage, allowing her to wear thinner gloves, reclaiming a fraction of dexterity.

### Book 7: The Final Resonance — ***The Pilot***

- **State:** The final battle. The Aliens attack with digital viruses as well as lasers.

- **The Action:** Lisbet engages in cyber-warfare with the Entity. It is a battle of minds.

- **The Tragedy:** Zephyr pilots the Flux-Mech. He is going on a suicide run. He calls Lisbet on the comms.

- **The Goodbye:** Zephyr: "Sparky, clear the path." Lisbet: "You owe me money, Scrap. Don't you dare die."

- **The Aftermath:** When Zephyr dies, Lisbet pilots his mech back to the bay remotely, refusing to let his body drift. She breaks down, finally letting Ria hold her (Ria's metal skin can withstand the shock). It is the first hug she has had in years.

- **The End:** In the new world, without magic, the static fades. Lisbet touches the grass. She holds Zephyr’s gold tooth in her bare hand. She cries because it feels cold, and heavy, and real.

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Hatcher (The Anchor)

- **The Dynamic:** **Father and Daughter.**

- **The Connection:** Hatcher is a **Null**. He is a void in the Resonance field. This makes him "quiet" to Lisbet’s hyper-sensitive senses. He is the only person who doesn't give her a headache.

- **The Ritual:** They sit back-to-back. Hatcher reads a paper book; Lisbet codes. The physical pressure of his back against hers (through coats) is her only source of oxytocin.

- **The Grief:** His death destroys her belief in safety.

### 2. With Zephyr (The Sibling)

- **The Dynamic:** **The Scoundrels.**

- **The Nicknames:** He calls her "Sparky" or "Glitch." She calls him "Scrap" or "Gold-Tooth."

- **The Symbiosis:** Zephyr is the Face; Lisbet is the Brains. He distracts the mark; she hacks the wallet.

- **The Love:** It is platonic but fierce. Zephyr kills anyone who looks at Lisbet wrong. Lisbet wipes Zephyr’s debt records whenever she can (though they always come back). They are the only family they have.

### 3. With Angelica (The User)

- **The Dynamic:** **Leader and Tool.**

- **The Friction:** Lisbet likes Angelica, but she resents that Angelica treats her like a utility. "Lisbet, open this." "Lisbet, hack that."

- **The Shift:** In Book 5, Angelica defends Lisbet from Vane, who wants to use Lisbet as a CPU component. Angelica says, "She is not hardware." This earns Lisbet’s loyalty.

### 4. With Ria (The Metal)

- **The Dynamic:** **The Unfeelables.**

- **The Irony:** Ria can touch but can't feel. Lisbet can feel but can't touch.

- **The Bond:** They are mirror images of sensory deprivation. In the later books, Ria becomes the only one who can physically interact with Lisbet because Ria’s metal skin acts as a ground for the electricity. Ria becomes Lisbet's physical shield.

## VIII. Key Quotes & Internal Monologues

- *"I don't hate people. I just hate the lag. Talking is so... slow. By the time you finish a sentence, I've already had the conversation three times in my head."* (Book 2)

- *"You want to see the truth? The truth is just code without a user interface. It’s ugly, raw, and it screams."* (Book 2)

- *"Don't touch me. I'm not being rude. I'm being safe. I am a live wire in a room full of dry paper."* (Book 3)

- *"The silence of the void is the loudest thing I've ever heard."* (Book 5)

- *"System offline. Goodbye, Scrap."* (Book 7, Zephyr’s death).
