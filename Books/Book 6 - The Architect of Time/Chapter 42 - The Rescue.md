### Scene 1: The Ram (The Kinetic Hammer)

- **Key Event:** The _Aeterna_ exits the Time Stream on a collision course with the Alien Mothership.
- **Detailed Description:** Space around the Zenith is a chaotic light show of laser fire and exploding debris. Suddenly, reality tears open. The _Aeterna_ bursts from the time rift, wreathed in blue Cherenkov radiation. It is not moving at standard combat speeds; it is moving at relativistic velocities. Angelica does not decelerate. She aims the reinforced prow of her ship—a spearhead of solid titanium and ancient ironwood—directly at the flank of the Alien Mothership. The sheer mass of the _Aeterna_, combined with its velocity, turns it into a planetary killer. The void around the ship distorts from the gravitational wake of its sudden arrival.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica suppresses the instinct to flinch. She is about to crash a starship. It goes against every pilot instinct she has. But she knows the math. The _Aeterna_'s shields are designed for the time stream; they can withstand the impact. The Mothership's shields are designed for energy weapons, not mass. She feels a cold, predatory focus.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She treats the collision not as a suicide run, but as a calculated kinetic strike. She is the bullet.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Shields forward. Brace for impact. We're knocking on the door."

- **Key Event:** The Impact.
- **Detailed Description:** The collision is silent in the vacuum, but the visual violence is absolute. The _Aeterna_ smashes into the Mothership with the force of a small asteroid. The alien vessel's energy shields flare and collapse instantly under the physical mass. The prow shears through the alien alloy, buckling bulkheads and venting atmosphere. The entire Mothership lists to the side, its formation broken. Debris spins away into the void—shattered hull plates, frozen bodies, and leaking plasma coolant. The impact sends a shockwave through the Zenith fleet, a ripple of awe and terror.

### Scene 2: The Break (Severing the Tether)

- **Key Event:** The tractor beam holding the Zenith fails.
- **Detailed Description:** The primary purpose of the ram was surgical: to destroy the tractor beam emitter array. As the _Aeterna_ ploughs through the midsection of the Mothership, it crushes the emitter spires. The green beam connecting the Mothership to the Zenith flickers and dies. The Zenith, suddenly released from the gravitational anchor, drifts free. The strain on its hull disappears, and the ship's engines flare to life, stabilizing its orbit.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ironwood, standing on the bridge of the Zenith, watches the event with his mouth open. He has never seen a maneuver like this. It is reckless, brutal, and brilliantly effective. He realizes he is no longer the most dangerous person in the sky. He feels a sudden, sharp respect for whoever is behind the helm of that monster.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "What... what is that thing? Identify! Who is flying that brick?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Comms Officer:** "Sir! We're free! The tractor beam is down! The enemy formation is breaking!"

### Scene 3: The Contact (The Voice from the Past)

- **Key Event:** Angelica hails the Zenith.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica opens a wide-band frequency. Her face appears on the main viewscreen of the Zenith. The crew gasps. They remember a twenty-year-old girl. The woman on the screen is forty. Her hair is stark white, cut short. A jagged scar runs from her temple to her jaw. Her eyes are not the golden eyes of the Interface; they are dark, tired, and burning with a cold intelligence. She wears armor made of cured leather and scavenged metal plates, looking more like a barbarian queen than a starship captain.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica looks at her friends—Ria, Kaelen, Zephyr. To them, she has been gone for five minutes. To her, it has been a lifetime. She feels a profound disconnect. She loves them, but she no longer feels like one of them. She is their ancestor now. She feels the weight of the years pressing down on her, the ghosts of the valley standing behind her.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She reintroduces herself not as a peer, but as a savior. She assumes command naturally, her voice heavy with the authority of twenty years of leadership.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "This is the Cavalry. You're welcome."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Angelica? What happened to you? You look..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Older. Wiser. Meaner. Now, stop gawking and form up on my wing. We have a fleet to burn."

### Scene 4: The Chaos (The Death Spin)

- **Key Event:** Angelica engages the Hunter fighters.
- **Detailed Description:** The alien fighters swarm toward the _Aeterna_ like angry wasps. Angelica doesn't try to outrun them. She hits the lateral thrusters, sending the _Aeterna_ into a violent flat spin. The ship becomes a spinning buzzsaw. Its point-defense turrets, mounted on the rotating hull, create a 360-degree wall of fire. The alien ships, anticipating standard flight paths, fly directly into the flak. They are shredded. The space around the _Aeterna_ becomes a kill zone.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica laughs. It is a dry, humorless sound. She realizes she is enjoying the violence. For twenty years, she built and planned. Now, she gets to destroy. It is a release. Every exploded ship is a small payment for the valley they burned. She feels a dark satisfaction in watching the Hunters burn.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Surprise, bastards. I brought a hammer."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They're confused. They don't know how to fight a ship that doesn't care about aerodynamics. Keep spinning! Clear the sky!"

- **Key Event:** The tide turns.
- **Detailed Description:** Emboldened by the _Aeterna_'s arrival, the Zenith's fighters rally. Zephyr leads a squadron of interceptors, using the chaos Angelica created to flank the enemy. The sky is filled with the blossoming fireballs of destroying alien ships. For the first time, the humans are winning. The alien fleet, broken and confused, begins to retreat.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica watches them run. She knows it's not over. This was just the vanguard. But for today, they have won. She allows herself a moment of relief, letting her head fall back against the headrest.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let them run. We'll be waiting."
