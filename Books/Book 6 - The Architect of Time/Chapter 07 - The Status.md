## Chapter 7: The Status

### Scene 1: The Respect

- **Key Event:** The Aftermath.
- **Detailed Description:** The duel in the mud is over. The silence in the clearing is absolute. Ragnar stands panting, wiping a stream of blood from his nose where Angelica struck him. He looks at the twisted door of the cage. He looks at the massive mammoth rib lying in the dirt—the weapon she used to defeat him.
- **Key Event:** The Act.
- **Detailed Description:** These are symbols of his failure, but he treats them as signs of revelation. He walks over to the cage. With a grunt of effort, he rips the remaining ribs from their lashings.

  - _Sound:_ _CRACK. SNAP._ The cage is dismantled.

- **Key Event:** The Declaration.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns to the tribe. He spreads his arms.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "No cage."

- **Key Event:** The Title.
- **Detailed Description:** He points a thick finger at Angelica.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "She is not meat. She is Warrior."

- **Key Event:** The Confusion.
- **Detailed Description:** The tribe mutters. They look at Angelica—small, bruising, soft-skinned. She doesn't look like a warrior.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hunter:** "She is small. Weak."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Strength is not just muscle! She hunts with this!" (He taps his temple hard). "She hunted me. And she caught me."

- **Key Event:** The Release.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks at Angelica. There is a new light in his eyes. Not friendship, but respect. Peer to peer.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "You are free to walk. But silence is best. Some still see a demon. Walk softly."

### Scene 2: The Freedom

- **Key Event:** The Walk.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica walks through the camp for the first time without chains or guards. Her legs are shaky from the fight, but she keeps her head high, mimicking their posture.
- **Key Event:** The Observation.
- **Detailed Description:** She uses her freedom to gather intelligence. She isn't just looking; she is analyzing.
- **Key Event:** The Water.
- **Detailed Description:** She watches how they get water. They pour river water into hollow logs filled with layers of charcoal, sand, and moss.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Carbon filtration. They understand purification. That's not instinct; that's science handed down as tradition.

- **Key Event:** The Leather.
- **Detailed Description:** She sees women chewing on stiff hides.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Using the enzymes in saliva to break down the collagen and soften the leather. It's gross, but it's effective chemical processing.

- **Key Event:** The Weapons.
- **Detailed Description:** She examines a rack of spears. The fetching—the feathers at the end—are not random. They are arranged in a specific spiral.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Rifling. They are inducing spin stability to increase range and accuracy. They discovered aerodynamics before the wheel.

- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** She stops feeling superior. She stops seeing them as primitive.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes these people aren't stupid. They are brilliant survivors. They are engineers of the wild, working with the only materials they have.

### Scene 3: The Miracle

- **Key Event:** The Crisis.
- **Detailed Description:** A scream cuts through the humid air. Panic erupts near the fire pit. A crowd gathers.
- **Key Event:** The Victim.
- **Detailed Description:** A young mother is clutching a small boy, maybe five years old. He is turning blue. He is clutching his throat, making horrible clucking sounds.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Mother:** "The Spirit! The Breath-Thief has him! Save him!"

- **Key Event:** The Ritual.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin, the Shaman, is there. He is shaking a rattle over the boy, chanting. He looks terrified. He knows the chant isn't working. He is trying to scare a spirit away, but the enemy is physical.
- **Key Event:** The Intervention.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica pushes through the crowd. She sees the boy's bulging eyes. She diagnoses it instantly. Choking.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Move! Get back!"

- **Key Event:** The Maneuver.
- **Detailed Description:** She grabs the boy from the mother. She spins him around. She finds the landmark—the xyphoid process at the base of the sternum. She makes a fist. She covers it with her other hand.

  - _Action:_ _Thrust. Thrust._ Up and in. Diaphragmatic compression.

- **Key Event:** The Result.
- **Detailed Description:** _POP._ A hard, brown nut flies out of the boy's mouth and hits the dirt. The boy sucks in a huge, ragged breath. Then he starts crying. It is the best sound in the world.
- **Key Event:** The Interpretation.
- **Detailed Description:** The mother grabs him, weeping.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Mother:** "He breathes! The Sky Demon gave him breath! She commanded the spirit to leave!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Wiping sweat from her forehead) "Physics gave him breath. The nut was blocking the trachea. I just applied pressure to the air reservoir."

### Scene 4: The Title

- **Key Event:** The Scene.
- **Detailed Description:** Later that night, Torin finds her sitting by the river. The camp is buzzing with the story.
- **Key Event:** The Gift.
- **Detailed Description:** He hands her a necklace. It is made of polished river stones, intricate and heavy.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "You fought the Breath-Thief. And you won. The mother says you reached inside him and pulled the death out."

- **Key Event:** The Correction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica sighs.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It wasn't a thief, Torin. It was a walnut. He didn't chew his food."

- **Key Event:** The Perspective.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin sits beside her.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "To the mother, it was death. To you, it was a puzzle. Is there a difference?"

- **Key Event:** The Naming.
- **Detailed Description:** He places the necklace over her head. It feels heavy, like a yoke.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Wise Woman. That is your name now."

- **Key Event:** The Protest.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica touches the stones.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm an engineer, Torin. Not a witch. I don't want them thinking I can do magic."

- **Key Event:** The Logic.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin looks at her seriously.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Here, they are the same. And the title protects you. A Warrior can be challenged. A Wise Woman is sacred. No one touches the Wise Woman."

- **Key Event:** The Agreement.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica thinks about it. Sacred implies safety. Safety means she can work. She can plan. She can build.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Fine. I'll take the title. But I'm not doing rain dances. And if anyone asks, it's just air pressure. Physics. Biology."

- **Key Event:** The Deal.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin smiles.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Call it what you want, Angelica. As long as the boy breathes. Just... don't start worshipping yourself."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm not a goddess. I'm just an engineer who knows how to fix a clogged pipe."
