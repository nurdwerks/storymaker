## Chapter 27: The Fuel

### Scene 1: The Problem

- **Key Event:** The inspection.
- **Detailed Description:** The Engineering Deck of the _Aeterna_ is a cathedral of silence and chrome. It has been buried for years, but the Zenith alloys haven't tarnished. Angelica walks the length of the containment drive, her footsteps echoing on the grating. The engine is beautiful—a torus ring utilizing exotic matter containment fields, designed to fold space itself. It is the most advanced piece of technology humanity ever built, and it is largely useless.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's perfect. Not a scratch on the injector ports. The magnetic seals are still at 100% integrity."

- **Key Event:** The reality.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin follows her, wiping his hands on a rag. He admires the machine, but he sees the practical problem. He walks to the main control console and taps the fuel gauge. The holographic display flickers to life, showing a large, red, blinking zero.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "It is perfect. But it's empty. The tanks are dry, Angelica. It's a statue."

- **Key Event:** The shortage.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the gauge. **0.00% Resin-Plasma.**

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need antimatter. Or high-yield ionic plasma. We need fuel that burns hotter than a star. We don't have the infrastructure to refine it. The village forge barely melts steel. We're trying to power a starship with charcoal."

- **Key Event:** The frustration.
- **Detailed Description:** She kicks the bulkhead in frustration. The sound rings out like a bell.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's a Ferrari with no gas. A billion-credit paperweight. I have a time machine. I have a warship. I have the keys to the kingdom... and I'm grounded because I can't fill the tank."

### Scene 2: The Solution

- **Key Event:** The map.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin walks over to the wall where they have pinned up a topographical map of the Hidden Valley. He studies the contour lines. He traces the ridge of the northern mountains.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "The mountain. Mount Silas. The elders say it shakes sometimes. They call it 'Restless Earth.' It smokes in the winter."

- **Key Event:** The realization.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stops pacing. She looks at the map, then at the seismic sensors on the wall panel. She pulls up the geological data scans from the _Aeterna_'s passive sensors.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's a volcano. Active magma chamber. Geothermal pressure is off the charts."

- **Key Event:** The idea.
- **Detailed Description:** Her eyes light up. It is the predator look—the look she gets when she sees a solution that is both brilliant and incredibly dangerous. She starts talking fast, her hands moving as she visualizes the schematic.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Magma is just molten energy. If we can tap the mantle... if we can funnel that heat into a particle accelerator... we can create a pinch-field. We can _make_ antimatter. Or at least enough resonance-plasma to jump-start the core."
  - _Internal Monologue:_ It is insane. It is the kind of plan **Zephyr** would call "suicide with extra steps." It relies on physics that barely hold together, the kind of unstable equation **Lisbet** would scribble on a napkin. But it is the only hand she has to play.

- **Key Event:** The scale.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin stares at her. The audacity of the plan takes a moment to sink in.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Tap a volcano? You want to drill into an active lava flow?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We turn the planet into a battery. We plug the ship directly into the earth's crust. It's efficient. It's renewable. And it's right next door."

### Scene 3: The Plan

- **Key Event:** The mobilization.
- **Detailed Description:** The next day, the village is transformed. It is no longer a refugee camp; it is a factory. The quiet peace of the valley is shattered by the sound of hammers and industry.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need metal! Everything you have! If it conducts, bring it here!"

- **Key Event:** The sacrifice.
- **Detailed Description:** The villagers bring everything. Gold jewelry handed down for generations. Copper wiring scavenged from the crash site. Ceramic plates from the mess hall. They pile it in the center of the square. They are melting down their past to build their escape.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elder:** "Will this save us?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It will give us a chance. That's more than we had yesterday."

- **Key Event:** The construction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica directs the forging. She needs a cable—a superconducting conduit three miles long and thick as a tree trunk. It has to withstand temperatures that would vaporize steel.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** (Operating the hydraulic press) "And then? Once we have the cable?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Then we drop it down the throat of the volcano. Like a straw."

- **Key Event:** The speech.
- **Detailed Description:** The villagers look terrified. They are farmers, not engineers. They look at the smoking mountain with fear. Angelica climbs onto a crate to address them. The fire of the forge illuminates her face.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need to plug into the planet! We are going to give the world a transfusion. From its heart to our ship. It's dangerous. It's crazy. But it's the only way we fly. Who is with me?"

### Scene 4: The Risk

- **Key Event:** The ascent.
- **Detailed Description:** They stand at the edge of the crater of Mount Silas. The heat is physical, a wall of pressure. It smells of sulfur and brimstone. The air shimmers. The cable is ready—a massive, gleaming snake of composite metal coiled on a giant winch.

- **Key Event:** The variables.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin looks down into the glowing red abyss. The lava churns five hundred feet below.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "If we miss the vein... if we don't hit the main flow... it won't work. We won't get enough pressure."

- **Key Event:** The danger.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica checks the pressure gauges on the winch.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "And if we hit a pressure pocket... if we puncture a gas bubble... we blow the top off the mountain. The village—and the ship—will be buried in ash and molten rock. We'll trigger an eruption."

- **Key Event:** The odds.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin looks at her, sweat dripping down his face.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "So, 50/50? Those are the odds?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Better odds than I usually get in the Silt."

- **Key Event:** The commitment.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica grins. It is a terrifying, manic grin. She puts her hand on the release lever. Below them, the volcano rumbles, a deep warning growl.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If we don't do this, the Hunters find us. We die here, waiting for them to come. I'd rather blow up trying to leave than die waiting to be taken."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let's do it."

- **Key Event:** The plunge.
- **Detailed Description:** She pulls the lever. The winch screams. The massive cable plunges over the edge, diving into the red throat of the world.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Drink up, _Aeterna_. Here comes the juice."
