# Character Profile: The Governess

**Archetype:** The Disciplinarian / The Wall
**True Sin:** PRIDE (Cruelty disguised as educational standards; she derives power from breaking the wills of the young).
**Virtue Mask:** COMPASSION (She frames her physical and emotional punishments as "Building Character").

## I. Role in the Story

The Governess is an ancient woman who raised Kaelen and now "mentors" the young women of the court. She is the ultimate enforcer of the Matriarchy’s social rules.

- **The Discipline:** She scolds Angelica for her posture, her tone, and her very existence, using "lessons" to constantly belittle and isolate her.
- **The Bond:** Kaelen treats her with fearful respect, which makes Angelica realize that even he is not free from the Matriarchy’s reach.

## II. Book 3 Integration: The Betrayal

- **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 13 (Nightfall).
- **The Scene:** Scene 2: The Unmasking.
- **The Event:** When Kaelen tries to save his aunt, The Governess steps in. She reveals she has been a spy for Magister Vane and the High Chamberlain for years, selling House Night's secrets.
- **The Twist:** She claims she did it because "Vane pays better" and she was tired of raising failures.
- **The Fate:** A Zenith Warden thanks her for her service, then shoots her in the back with a stun-round (or lethal round, effectively ending her role). Kaelen watches the woman who raised him die as a traitor.
- **Status:** **Deceased / Executed.**
