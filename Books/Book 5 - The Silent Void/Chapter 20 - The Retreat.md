## Chapter 20: The Retreat

### Scene 1: The Airlock Corridor

- **Key Event:** The group reaches the emergency airlock.
- **Detailed Description:** The survivors—Angelica, Kaelen, Ria, and a handful of shell-shocked scientists—stumble into the corridor leading to the main airlock. Behind them, the bio-dome of Sector X is tearing itself apart. The blast doors begin to close, massive slabs of plasteel designed to withstand hull breaches. The gears grind, fighting the gravitational distortions left by the singularity. The air is thin, and the temperature is dropping rapidly as the life support fails. Frost creeps along the walls, freezing the condensation into intricate patterns.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica stops. She looks back through the narrowing gap. She sees the jungle of Sector X—the strange, mutated plants, the bio-luminescent moss—freezing instantly as the vacuum rushes in. It is a world dying in front of her eyes. She feels the weight of Aris's datapad in her pocket. It feels like a tombstone. She wonders if she made the right choice, sacrificing the knowledge of Sector X for their lives.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She forces herself to turn away. She hits the "Seal" button on the control panel, condemning Sector X to death to save the ship. It is a Captain's choice—sacrificing the limb to save the body. She locks her emotions away.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Secure the door. Sector X is dead. Don't look back. There's nothing there for us anymore."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Nearly us too. That was too close. The math almost ate us. I hate math."

- **Key Event:** The ship's AI reports the arrival of the alien fleet.
- **Detailed Description:** As the door seals with a definitive *thud*, the red emergency lights in the corridor begin to pulse. The ship's AI voice, calm and melodic, announces a new threat. "Proximity Alert. Multiple contacts detected. Fleet deployment confirmed. Prey status: Found." The words echo in the metal hallway, more terrifying than the vacuum they just escaped.
- **Internal Conflict:** General Ironwood, leaning against the wall and clutching a wounded side, closes his eyes. He recognizes the sensor profile. It is the "Hunters"—the alien race that has been pursuing the *Aeterna* since the beginning. They found them. He feels tired. He has been fighting this war for too long.

### Scene 2: The Repair

- **Key Event:** The survivors must seal a localized hull breach.
- **Detailed Description:** A section of the corridor wall has buckled from the gravity waves. A hiss of escaping air signals a micro-fracture. The pressure alarm wails. If they don't seal it, the corridor will depressurize before they can reach the bridge. The metal groans under the stress.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet, usually the "Glitch" who prefers code to physical labor, steps up. She grabs a canister of emergency sealant foam. She knows the chemistry; she knows the cure. She pushes past the soldiers.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She sprays the foam over the crack. It expands and hardens instantly into a gray, concrete-like patch. She works with a speed and precision that surprises the soldiers. She is terrified, but her hands are steady because this is a problem she can solve.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Oxygen levels stabilizing. Patch is holding. But it's brittle. We can't take a direct hit here. We need to move."

### Scene 3: The Plan

- **Key Event:** The group prepares to move to the bridge.
- **Detailed Description:** They regroup in the sealed corridor. They check their weapons. Ammo is low. Energy cells are depleted. They are a ragged group of survivors, covered in dust, blood, and frost. But the news of the fleet changes everything. There is no more running. They have to make a stand.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen looks at Angelica. He sees the change in her. She isn't the scared girl from the Undercity anymore. She is the one giving orders. He decides to follow her, not because of her bloodline, but because she kept her head when the world was ending.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "They're here. The Hunters. We can't hide in the nebula anymore. We're exposed."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Then we stop hiding. We go to the bridge. We wake up the big guns. And we use Aris's map to get out of here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Now we fight. No more hiding. I like that plan. Let's make them regret finding us."
