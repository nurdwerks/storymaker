# Character Profile: Sir Alistair

**Archetype:** The Boisterous Cruelty / The Brute
**True Sin:** WRATH (He hides his bloodlust beneath the guise of sport).
**Virtue Mask:** CAMARADERIE (He plays the part of the "Good Ol' Boy").

## I. Role in the Story

Sir Alistair is Duke Grey’s Master of the Hunt and a high-ranking member of the "Old Blood" aristocrats. He represents the casual cruelty of those who view the weak as prey.

- **The Interaction:** He shares an easy, physical camaraderie with Duke Grey—clapping him on the back and sharing brandy—a bond Angelica is entirely excluded from.
- **The Cruelty:** He makes jokes about "culling the herd" (referring to the Silt population) while treating Angelica like a servant who wandered into the room, reinforcing her status as an unwanted outsider.
- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 15: The Game of Gears](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1270-1290)
- **Defining Quote:** "A 'heroic' death that conveniently removed the only man who knew Grey's drinking habits." (Grey's internal monologue, revealing flaw: PARANOIA)

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Honorable Death in Battle. During a desperate defense of the High-Levels, Sir Alistair dies leading a charge against a mutant horde. He dies with a laugh and a glass of brandy in his hand, a "hero" to the very end.
- **Impact on Duke Grey:** Grey is genuinely shaken. Alistair was the only one he felt he could be "himself" with. His death turns Grey's stoicism into cold, focused wrath, leading to more aggressive and dangerous military decisions.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "life of the party" is gone. The Grey Court becomes even more somber and militaristic, as the remaining members realize that even the "Old Blood" can bleed and die.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | Corinne's cell is furnished like a guest room, with a velvet chaise and a tea service. It is a prison of politeness. **Sir Alistair** guards the door, leaning against the frame with a crystal glass of brandy in his hand. He winks at Corinne, treating her imprisonment as a amusing timeout. Lady Vesper sits opposite her, pouring tea. Vesper is trying to turn Corinne, to make her testify against Angelica. She appeals to Corinne's vanity and her status as a Highborn. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Dialog | **Sir Alistair:** "Don't pout, Corinne. We're just culling the herd. You're too pretty for the chopping block." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | Corinne ignores Alistair. Vesper insinuates that Corinne is just a "pet" of the resistance, dragged into the mud by commoners. Corinne sips her tea. She looks Vesper in the eye and dismantles her. She points out that Vesper is merely Vane's lapdog, a "Gatekeeper" with no real power. |
