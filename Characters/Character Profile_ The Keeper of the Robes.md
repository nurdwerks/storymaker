# Character Profile: The Keeper of the Robes

**Archetype:** The Wardrobe Master / The Technician of Illusion
**True Sin:** SLOTH (He aids in the maintenance of a comfortable, grand lie rather than facing the truth of the Emperor's status).
**Virtue Mask:** DILIGENCE (He fusses over the Emperor’s "image" with performative care).

## I. Role in the Story

The Keeper of the Robes is a servant responsible for the Emperor's clothes—and, more importantly, the holographic emitters that maintain his image. He is a key player in the Zenith's theater of power.

- **The Task:** He fusses over the Emperor's image as if it were biological reality, maintaining the illusion of a living, breathing ruler.
- **The Scorn:** He sneers at Angelica’s utilitarian Silt-wear, viewing her practical clothes as an affront to the "divinity" of the Imperial image he works so hard to project.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 30](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md)
- **Defining Quote:** "His hand still clutching a datapad that contained a broadcast code he never sent." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: SLOTH/FAILED REDEMPTION)
