# Chapter Summary Template

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Tone Rule:** All summaries must be written in a **Neutral and Factual** tone. Avoid subjective commentary or interpretation—focus on what happens, who is involved, and what is said.

> [!NOTE]
> There is **no limit** to the number of scenes, key events, character defining moments, or key dialog entries. Include as many as necessary to fully capture the chapter.

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Scenes:** Break each chapter into component scenes based on location changes, time jumps, or POV shifts.
2. **Key Events:** Bullet point all significant actions, revelations, or plot progressions.
3. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
4. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
5. **Flexibility:** Not every key event requires both a defining moment and dialog—include what applies.
