# Character Profile: Ria (The Iron Vanguard)

**Archetype:** The Scrapper / The Capo / The Survivor **True Sin:** ENVY (A cancerous, burning need to possess what the Zenith have: safety, caloric abundance, and respect. It is not just wanting _more_; it is a resentment that others have it _easier_). **Virtue Mask:** DILIGENCE (She frames her Envy as "Hard Work." She believes she suffers because she is _earning_ her place, unlike the lazy elite or the gifted Angelica. "I bleed for my bread; you just inherit it").

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Industrial Titan

Ria is built like a piece of Undercity machinery—dense, heavy, and designed to take a beating. She is the antithesis of the Zenith aesthetic; where they are tall and wire-thin, she is compact and broad.

### 1. The Undercity Physique

- **Stature:** She stands at 5'6" but weighs close to 200 lbs of dense, corded muscle. Her center of gravity is low, making her almost impossible to knock over. She walks with a heavy, rolling gait, leading with her shoulders, like a boxer wading into a ring.

- **The Face:** Her head is shaved down to the scalp, originally to prevent hair-grabbing in food riots, later as a stylistic rejection of Zenith vanity. Her nose has been broken three times and set crookedly by her own hand. She has a "resting snarl"—a tension in her upper lip that exposes a chipped incisor whenever she is assessing a threat.

- **The Skin (The Transformation):**

  - _Book 1:_ Her skin is calloused, scarred from mining accidents and street fights. It is the color of bruised clay.

  - _Book 3 (The Merge):_ As she begins to rely on **Titan** (her Bond), her skin takes on a permanent, dull-grey metallic sheen. It isn't shiny like Kaelen's "Shimmer"; it looks like cast iron. Her veins bulge, looking less like blood vessels and more like insulated cables running under the dermis.

  - _Book 7 (The Final Form):_ She is more metal than meat. Patches of her skin have calcified into actual steel plates. Her movements are accompanied by the faint sound of grinding gears.

### 2. The Dead Hands (Physiological Toll)

Ria's magic requires the sacrifice of **Sensation**. This has created a harrowing physical reality for her.

- **The Hands:** Her hands are large, square, and battered. From the mid-forearm down, the skin is paler, dead-looking. She has scars from burns and cuts she never felt happening. She often looks at her hands as if they belong to someone else.

- **The Burn Scars:** Because she cannot feel heat in her extremities, she frequently burns herself on hot mugs, exhaust pipes, or energy weapons. Her arms are a roadmap of accidental injury.

- **The Twitch:** When she pushes her Bond too far, her muscles spasm uncontrollably. She has to beat her own limbs to get them to stop seizing, a violent act of self-regulation.

### 3. The Eyes of Envy

Her eyes are a muddy yellow-brown, bloodshot from chronic lack of sleep (she fears sleeping because that's when people steal from you). She possesses a specific gaze called "The Inventory." When she enters a room, she doesn't look at faces; she looks at _assets_. She tracks weapons, food, exits, and valuables. She never blinks when looking at something she wants.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Ria wears "Scavenger Tech." Nothing matches; everything is stolen, repurposed, or reinforced. She is a walking fortress of scrap metal.

- **The Vest:** She wears a stolen Peacekeeper tactical vest, originally white but spray-painted matte black with the crude yellow symbol of Squad Iron stenciled on the chest. Over the course of the series, she welds extra plates of scrap metal onto it—pieces of a blast door, a car hood, a drone casing. It is an evolving history of her battles.

- **The Boots:** Heavy, magnetic mining boots that clang when she walks. They are weighted with lead. She wears them even to bed. They are a weapon as much as footwear; a kick from Ria breaks femurs.

- **The Ration Bandolier:** Instead of ammunition, she wears a bandolier across her chest stuffed with nutrient bars, dried meat, and water pouches. Having food visibly strapped to her chest is a status symbol in the Undercity—it says, "I have enough to eat, and I dare you to try and take it."

- **The Trophies:**

  - _The Finger-Bones:_ In Book 1, she kills a Chimera in the Arena. She keeps the finger-bones, drilling holes in them and wearing them on a leather thong around her neck. They rattle when she moves.

  - _The Officer's Pip:_ In Book 3, she rips the rank insignia off a Zenith Captain she kills. She welds it to her shoulder pauldron upside down—a sign of disrespect.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Ria is defined by her hyper-vigilance and her obsession with "earning" survival.

- **The Numbness Check:** Due to her Sacrifice, Ria constantly "checks" if she can still feel. It is a compulsive tick.

  - _The Pinch:_ She digs her nails into her thigh or arm until she draws blood.

  - _The Heat:_ She holds her hand over a flame until she smells singing hair.

  - _The Reaction:_ If she feels pain, she smiles in relief. If she feels nothing, a flicker of absolute terror crosses her face before she masks it with aggression.

- **Hoarding:** She cannot leave a room without taking something. A spoon, a battery, a piece of wire, a half-eaten apple. She stuffs her pockets until they bulge. "Resources," she mutters. She is terrified of having _nothing_.

- **The Spit:** She has a visceral physical rejection of Zenith culture. Whenever an Apex character mentions "Honor," "Tradition," or "Legacy," Ria spits on the floor. It is her way of marking territory and showing contempt for abstract concepts that don't fill bellies.

- **Sleeping with Eyes Open:** A habit learned in the Silt orphanages. She dozes in short, 10-minute bursts, sitting up against a wall with a knife in her hand. She never enters REM sleep around others.

- **"Hard Work":** When she succeeds, she attributes it to effort. When Angelica succeeds, Ria attributes it to luck or privilege. "I had to break my knuckles to punch that wall. You just waved your hand. Don't tell me we're the same."

## IV. The Bond: Titan and The Sensory Void

Ria's magic is blunt force trauma. It is ugly, loud, and effective.

- **The Beast:** **Titan** (The Steel-Hide Gorilla).

  - **Appearance:** Titan is not a sleek, magical creature like Umbra or Aeon. He is a hulk of rusted iron, hydraulic pistons, and matted wire-fur. He moves with the weight of a bulldozer. He smells of old grease and wet dog.

  - **Personality:** Titan is simple. He wants to smash. He feeds on Ria's aggression. He is the manifestation of her desire to be immovable.

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Manifestation Type:** **Merge**. Ria rarely summons Titan to fight _for_ her. She summons him _onto_ her. The construct overlays her physical body. Her muscles expand, her skin turns to living steel, and she gains supernatural strength and density.

  - **Overt Power:** She can punch through blast doors, lift hover-cars, and withstand small-arms fire. She becomes a living tank.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Sensation (The Sensory Void).**

  - _The Cost:_ While Merged, she feels nothing. No pain, but also no touch, no temperature, no texture.

  - _The Permanent Toll:_ Every time she Merges, the numbness lingers longer after she separates. The nerves die. By Book 4, she cannot feel the texture of fabric. By Book 7, she is trapped in a sensory deprivation tank of her own flesh. She can see and hear, but she cannot feel a hug, a kiss, or the wind. She is invincible, but she is isolated from the physical world.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

Ria was born in **Sector 11**, the heavy industrial zone of the Undercity. It is a place of loud machinery and constant accidents. Her name, **Ria**, is Undercity slang for "Slag" or "Scrap Metal." She wears it as a badge of honor—she is the discarded thing that refuses to be melted down.

- **Jax:** She had a younger brother, Jax. He was small and slow. During the "Famine of '09," rations were cut. Ria was fast enough to steal food from the chutes, but Jax wasn't. She tried to share, but she was starving too. She ate half a ration bar while he watched her, crying. He died a week later.

- **The Trauma:** Jax's death broke her moral compass. She decided that "Sharing is weakness." She vowed to never be hungry again. She adopted the philosophy of **Envy**: If someone has it, they are the enemy, and I must take it.

**The Inciting Incident (Pre-Book 1):** Ria didn't volunteer for the Iron Selection. She fought for the slot. She beat three other candidates in a Sector 11 pit fight to earn the "Volunteer Ticket." She killed a boy to get into the Arcanum. She entered with blood on her hands, determined to win the citizenship that would ensure she never starved again.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 1: The Iron Selection — **_The Bully_**

- **State:** Ria is the antagonist in the bunkroom. She bullies Angelica because Angelica represents everything Ria hates: weakness that survives on luck.

- **The Dynamic:** She establishes dominance by stealing resources (boots/food). She forces Angelica to serve her.

- **The Crack:** In the Arena (Chapter 18), when the Chimera attacks, Ria summons Titan. She expects to be the hero. Instead, she gets pinned. Angelica saves her using Time-Magic. This humiliates Ria. She realizes she isn't the strongest in the room. Her **Envy** spikes to murderous levels.

- **The Climax:** In the finale, she tries to kill Angelica for the bonus. She is weeping while she does it. "I can't go back," she sobs. When Angelica spares her (The Silt Broadcast), Ria doesn't feel gratitude; she feels debt. And she hates debt.

### Book 2: The Cipher of Sins — **_The Bounty Hunter_**

- **State:** Ria is recruited by the Crown as a "Freelancer" (Warden). She justifies working for the enemy as "Diligence." It's a job. It pays.

- **The Hunt:** She hunts Angelica through the Mid-Levels. She has upgraded her gear with Zenith tech. She rams Angelica's hover-bike in Chapter 10.

- **The Turning Point:** In Chapter 29, during the Broadcast, Ria watches a Zenith Warden beat a child who looks like Jax. The facade cracks. She realizes she has become the thing that killed her brother. She crushes the Warden's skull. She switches sides not for Angelica, but for Jax.

### Book 3: The Game of Gears — **_The Butcher_**

- **State:** She becomes "General Ria." She leads the violent faction of the Silt Rebellion.

- **The Conflict:** She demands Angelica assassinate Duke Grey. Angelica wants diplomacy. Ria calls her a coward. "You play princess, I play soldier."

- **The Tactic:** Ria uses **Helium-3 Mining Drills** to breach the Palace. She executes prisoners on live stream. She wants the Zenith to fear the Silt.

- **The Betrayal:** At the **Obsidian Banquet** (Obsidian Banquet), when the crossbows fire, Ria grabs a waiter and uses him as a human shield. She survives while Leo (Angelica's brother) dies. She looks Angelica in the eye and mouths, "Survival of the fittest." It is the ultimate betrayal of their friendship.

### Book 4: The Stone Season — **_The Rusty Knight_**

- **State:** In the apocalypse, Ria's metal skin begins to rust. Without Zenith maintenance, her body is failing. She needs oil and high-calorie fuel.

- **The Decline:** She is in constant pain (or rather, the phantom sensation of pain where her nerves used to be). She becomes surly and aggressive.

- **The Dynamic with Corinne:** She bullies Corinne relentlessly. But when Corinne saves her from a Viral using a high-heel, Ria gains a grudging respect. "You're useless, but you're sharp."

- **The Hive Mind:** Ria shoots Dr. Aris when he tries to merge with the Mother. She rejects the Hive Mind because she refuses to share her mind. "My head is the only place I own."

### Book 5: The Silent Void — **_The Fighter_**

- **State:** On the Ship, Ria aligns with the "Fighters" faction. She wants to use the ship's weapons to blast the Aliens.

- **The Conflict:** She tries to seize the Armory. She fights Kaelen (The Hider). It is a brutal stalemate—Shadow vs. Steel.

- **The Realization:** When the Gravity Well (Chapter 8) eats Aris, Ria realizes that brute strength cannot punch physics. She feels small for the first time. She accepts that she needs Angelica's mind to survive. She becomes Angelica's bodyguard, not out of love, but out of necessity.

### Book 6: The Architect of Time — **_The Absence_**

- **State:** Angelica is in the past. Ria is in the future timeline, holding the line on the bridge against the Aliens.

- **The Legend:** We only see glimpses of her through the Time-Window. She is older, scarred, and completely encased in metal. She has become a statue of war, holding the door for 20 years while waiting for Angelica to return.

### Book 7: The Final Resonance — **_The Redemption_**

- **State:** The reunion. Ria is barely human. She speaks through a vocoder because her throat is partially calcified.

- **The Tragedy:** She cannot feel Angelica's touch when they hug. She cries, but she can't feel the tears on her face. "I won," she says, "but I don't know if the prize is real."

- **The Climax:** In the Hull Battle, the Aliens breach the airlock. Ria Merges fully with Titan, fusing her consciousness with the metal forever. She becomes a living bulkhead, holding the vacuum back with her own body.

- **The End:** In the new world (Earth Two), the magic dissolves. Ria is separated from Titan. She is flesh again. She lies in the grass, weeping, because she can feel the blades of grass against her skin. It is painful, overwhelming, and beautiful. Her arc ends with her finally having enough—enough food, enough safety, enough sensation. The Envy dies because the need is met.

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Angelica (The Shadow and The Sun)

This is the core emotional spine of the series outside the romance.

- **The Dynamic:** **Talent vs. Effort.** Angelica is the "Chosen One." Ria is the "Earned One."

- **The Friction:** Ria hates that Angelica pays no cost. "I gave my hands for this strength. You just woke up with it." Ria constantly challenges Angelica to prove she can bleed.

- **The Connection:** They are the only two who remember the smell of Sector 12. In the high courts of the Zenith, they share a secret language of poverty. They are sisters who hate each other.

- **The Resolution:** In Book 7, Angelica admits, "I could never have held the door. Only you could do that." Ria finally receives the validation she craved—not that she is _better_ than Angelica, but that she is _necessary_.

### 2. With Corinne (The Princess and The Pauper)

- **The Dynamic:** **Bully and Victim** turned **Partners**.

- **The Friction:** Ria hates Corinne's softness. Corinne hates Ria's smell. Book 3 is full of Ria terrorizing Corinne.

- **The Shift:** In Book 4, Corinne sews up a wound on Ria's back (where the metal hasn't covered). Corinne doesn't flinch at the gore. Ria realizes Corinne has "soft hands, but a hard stomach."

- **The End:** They become an odd couple. Corinne teaches Ria how to read (she was illiterate); Ria teaches Corinne how to use a knife.

### 3. With General Ironwood (The Toxic Father)

- **The Dynamic:** **Mentor and Weapon.**

- **The Seduction:** Ironwood tells Ria she is special. He gives her rank. He feeds her Envy, directing it at the Zenith.

- **The Break:** Ria realizes Ironwood doesn't care about the Silt people; he only cares about winning the war. When he orders a suicide charge of child soldiers, Ria kills him. "I don't sacrifice Runts," she says, echoing her protection of her brother. She takes his coat and becomes the General.

### 4. With Zephyr (The Rats)

- **The Dynamic:** **Thieves' Honor.**

- **The Interaction:** They bicker constantly. Zephyr tries to sell her gear; she threatens to bend his cyber-arm.

- **The Respect:** They both know what it's like to be bottom-feeders. When Zephyr dies in Book 7, Ria is the one who retrieves his body. She welds his gold tooth into her armor so he "keeps his value."

## VIII. Key Quotes & Internal Monologues

- _"You think you know hungry? Hungry isn't skipping lunch. Hungry is looking at your brother and wondering how many calories are in his arm. Don't talk to me about morality, Princess. Morality is for people with full bellies."_ (Book 1)

- _"I don't want to change the world. I want to own it. I want to sit in the chair and put my boots on the table and know that no one can move me."_ (Book 2)

- _"I can't feel the rain. It looks cold, but it's just... data. I'm forgetting what cold feels like. Is that victory? Or am I just dead already?"_ (Book 4)

- _"Hold the line! If they want this ship, they have to chew through me first! And I taste like iron!"_ (Book 7)

- _"It hurts. The grass... it scratches. It itches. It's the best thing I've ever felt."_ (Epilogue)

### 4. The Vanguard Unit

Ria is a soldier's soldier. She leads a squad of elite shock-troops who would die for her. They have a bond forged in blood and mud that Angelica, the "Commander" who sits in the back, can never understand.

- **Sergeant "Knuckles":** A brawler who cleans his gun while listening to Ria. He calls her "Boss" with genuine love. He looks at Angelica with suspicion. "You give the orders, Princess. We do the dying."

- **Medic "Stitch":** The squad medic who patches Ria up after every fight. There is a tenderness in how he bandages her hands. He scowls at Angelica. "You're working her too hard. She's flesh and blood, not clockwork like you."

- **Sniper "Ghost":** A silent watcher who covers Ria's six. She never speaks to Angelica. She only speaks to Ria. The telepathic-like coordination between them on the battlefield leaves Angelica feeling like a third wheel.

- **Private "Rookie":** A young kid Ria is mentoring. He looks at Ria like she's a goddess of war. He is terrified of Angelica. He hides behind Ria when Angelica approaches. Ria ruffles his hair, a gesture of affection she never gives Angelica.

| Book 4 | Chapter 06 | Moment | **Ria** — Displays no fear, viewing the battle as a purely mechanical problem of "flow control." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 07 | Moment | **Lady Corinne** — Attempts to pull rank on Ria, demanding to be escorted to the "proper authorities." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 07 | Key Event | Ria ignores Corinne’s orders and begins stripping the escape pod for parts (batteries, oxygen canisters). |
| Book 4 | Chapter 07 | Moment | **Ria** — Treats Corinne's status with absolute indifference, focusing only on the pod's technical specs. |

| Book 4 | Chapter 09 | Moment | **Ria** — Already planning violence, viewing Vane as a target rather than a force of nature. |

| Book 4 | Chapter 33 | Key Event | The hatch is frozen shut by centuries of vacuum-seal and structural shifting; Ria (still paralyzed) suggests using her internal core as a localized heat source. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 33 | Moment | **Ria** — Offers to "burn out" her remaining functional logic boards to provide the thermal expansion needed to crack the seal. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 33 | Key Event | Ria’s core glows white-hot, and with a thunderous groan of metal, the hatch seal shatters, allowing the group to pry the door open. |

| Book 7 | Chapter 04 | Moment | **Ria** — She puts a hand on the wall and feels it vibrating. It feels cold, like ice. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 05 | Key Event | The senior staff (Kaelen, Ria, Angelica) debate the meaning. |

| Book 7 | Chapter 09 | Moment | **Ria** — She vomits. The violence is so clean, so mathematical, it is more horrifying than gore. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 10 | Key Event | Ria removes the safety limiters on Titan. If they are going to fight flat objects, they need kinetic density. She prepares for a spacewalk. |

| Book 7 | Chapter 12 | Moment | **Ria** — She works the tactical map, ordering the sealing of sections even though she knows stragglers are still inside. She chooses the many over the few. |

| Book 7 | Chapter 13 | Key Event | Ria fully merges with Titan. Her skin turns gunmetal grey. She becomes a walking tank. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 13 | Key Event | The Shards try to flatten Ria, but her density is too high. She catches a 2D shard and snaps it—it shatters like glass. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 13 | Moment | **Ria** — She laughs, a harsh metallic sound. The simple act of smashing something restores her confidence. |

| Book 7 | Chapter 32 | Key Event | Ria punches the tactical table, denting the steel. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 35 | Key Event | Kaelen and Ria follow her. They beg her not to do it. The Interface burns out the mind of anyone who isn't augmented (like Vane was). |
| Book 7 | Chapter 36 | Key Event | Kaelen and Ria take up guard positions at the door. They know the Entity might send physical drones to kill her body while her mind is away. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 50 | Key Event | **Ria** is human. She rolls in the grass, laughing and crying at the sensation of itching skin. |
