### Scene 1: The Bridge / Interface Throne

- **Key Event:** Angelica approaches the Interface Throne, discovering that it is not a seat of power but a specialized cockpit that biologically fuses the pilot to the ship's neural architecture.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Realizes that her entire bloodline was engineered by the Founders to be "components" or "biological hardware" rather than true rulers.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's not a throne. It's a socket."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are hardware, my dear. Beautiful, biological hardware. You are the key."

- **Key Event:** Vane explains that the neural load will melt a normal brain and that the pilot can never truly "unplug" without losing their mind, making it a one-way transformation.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Volunteers to take the throne instead, but is rejected by Vane because he lacks the "imagination" and "resonance" of the Sangreal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "I'll do it. Let me die doing something useful."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are a hammer, Ironwood. We need a scalpel."
