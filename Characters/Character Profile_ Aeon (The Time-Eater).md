# Character Profile: Aeon (The Time-Eater)

**Archetype:** The Living Artifact / The Clockwork God / The Observer **True Sin:** SLOTH (He exists outside of urgency. He has watched the universe die a billion times. He perceives the struggle of the characters as a fleeting entertainment, like a TV show he has seen before. He is slow to act because he knows the ending). **Virtue Mask:** PATIENCE (To Angelica, he appears wise and deliberate. He claims he is waiting for the "Critical Moment" to intervene, masking his profound indifference to linear time).

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Golden Paradox

Aeon is not a biological dragon. He is a piece of the universe's source code given physical form.

### 1. The Clockwork Anatomy

- **Scale:** He is small, the size of a large raven or hawk. He perches on Angelica's shoulder, his weight surprisingly heavy (density of a neutron star in a small package).

- **Composition:** He is made of **living metal**. His scales are not keratin; they are plates of gold filigree that shift and click like the tumblers of a safe. Underneath the scales, one can see gears spinning, pistons pumping light, and springs winding.

- **The Sound:** He does not breathe. He _ticks_. In quiet moments, the sound is soothing, like a grandfather clock. In moments of danger, the ticking accelerates into a high-pitched whine, like a bomb counting down.

- **The Eyes:** His eyes are not biological. They are apertures—camera lenses made of sapphire glass. When he "blinks," the shutter spirals closed. Inside the lens, you can see the reflection of events that haven't happened yet.

### 2. The Lack of Heat

Aeon is room temperature. He does not radiate body heat. When he sits on Angelica's shoulder, he feels like a piece of jewelry, not a pet. This lack of warmth disturbs **Kaelen**, whose shadow-beast is freezing cold, and **Ria**, whose gorilla is burning hot. Aeon is neutral.

## II. Mechanics and Ticks

Aeon interacts with the world through **consumption of entropy**.

- **The Diet:** He does not eat meat. He eats **Time**.

  - _The Visual:_ When he is hungry, he bites an object—an apple, a stone, a gun. He does not chew it. The object instantly turns to dust, aging ten thousand years in a second. He absorbs the temporal energy released by the decay.

  - _The Utility:_ Angelica uses this to dispose of evidence (Book 2) or rust locks (Book 3).

- **Telepathy:** He speaks in Angelica's mind. His voice is not a whisper; it is an echo. It sounds like her own voice, but spoken by an old woman in a cathedral.

- **The Sleep Mode:** When inactive, Aeon curls into a perfect sphere. His legs and head retract into his shell. He looks exactly like an ornate, oversized pocket watch. Angelica often holds him in this form when she is stressed, rubbing his smooth casing like a worry stone.

## III. Narrative Arc & Growth

**The Observer (Books 1-3):** Aeon is passive. He offers cryptic advice ("The gear must break to stop the machine"). He saves Angelica in the Arena not out of love, but because if she dies, the "Show" ends. He is bored.

**The Participant (Book 4-5):** In the Stone Season, Aeon changes. He sees Angelica kill **The Mother** to save free will. This defies his calculations. He realizes Angelica is creating a timeline he hasn't seen before. He starts "eating" bad outcomes—nudging probability to keep her alive.

**The Sacrifice (Book 7):** In the final negotiation with the **Entity**, Angelica needs to offer something of infinite value. She offers Aeon.

- _The Twist:_ Aeon accepts. He realizes that "Ending" is the only thing he hasn't experienced. He allows Angelica to deconstruct him. His gears unravel, becoming the raw physics needed to terraform the new planet. His final thought is not profound; it is simple: _"Finally. Quiet."_
