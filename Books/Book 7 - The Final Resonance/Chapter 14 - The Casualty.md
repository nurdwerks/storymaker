## Chapter 14: The Casualty

### Scene 1: The Ambush

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron, led by Ria, is engaged in a zero-gravity skirmish on the external hull of the *Aeterna*. They are fighting "Shards"—two-dimensional slices of matter projected by the Entropy Fleet.
- **Detailed Description:** The hull of the generation ship is a vast, curved plain of grey metal, scarred by centuries of micrometeoroid impacts. Ria and her squad move using magnetic boots, their steps heavy and deliberate. The stars above are blocked by the massive, geometric shapes of the enemy fleet. The Shards are terrifying because they are nearly invisible edge-on. They look like razor-thin lines of black light. When they turn, they are flat, featureless planes of void. They slice through cover, weapons, and armor with zero resistance. A Shard passes through a communications array, and the metal tower simply falls apart, the cut surfaces perfectly smooth.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria feels a cold sweat inside her sealed suit. She is used to fighting things she can hit. She can't hit these. Her bullets pass through them. Her fists find no purchase. She feels clumsy and obsolete, a relic of a physical war in a mathematical battle. She barks orders to her squad, her voice tight with suppressed panic. "Keep moving! Don't let them align! Flank them!"

- **Key Event:** A larger Geometric Shape (a Dodecahedron) lands behind Squad Iron. It unfolds, revealing a gravity-manipulation core.
- **Detailed Description:** The Dodecahedron lands silently, its magnetic clamps locking onto the hull. It opens like a flower made of obsidian. Inside, a core of violet light pulses rhythmically. The gravity on the local section of the hull spikes instantly.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria is slammed to the deck. Her suit's servos whine in protest. The readout on her HUD flashes red: "GRAVITY ALERT: 50G." She can't breathe. Her chest feels like it is being crushed by a hydraulic press. She watches helplessly as her squad is pinned around her like insects on a board.

### Scene 2: The Sacrifice of Knuckles

- **Key Event:** "Knuckles," Ria's second-in-command and oldest friend, is pinned nearest the Dodecahedron. He realizes the gravity field is directional and focused on the group.
- **Detailed Description:** Knuckles is a bear of a man, his armor reinforced with extra plating. Even he is flattened, his faceplate cracking under the pressure. He looks at Ria. He sees she is struggling to reach her EMP grenades. He looks at the Dodecahedron. He knows he is the only one close enough to reach it. He knows it will kill him.
- **Internal Conflict:** Knuckles doesn't have a deep internal monologue. He is a soldier. He sees the problem, and he sees the solution. He loves Ria. She saved him in the Undercity. He decides to pay her back.

- **Key Event:** Knuckles manages to prime a gravity-grenade. He can't throw it. He has to crawl.
- **Detailed Description:** With a roar that tears his throat lining, Knuckles forces his arm to move. Bones snap. He drags himself inch by inch toward the alien device. The pressure is liquefying his organs. Blood sprays the inside of his helmet. He reaches the base of the Dodecahedron. He jams the grenade into the unfolding mechanism.
- **Key Event:** The Dodecahedron targets him. A Planar Beam flattens him instantly.
- **Detailed Description:** The alien machine reacts. A beam of white light shoots down. Knuckles doesn't explode. He becomes two-dimensional. His armor, his body, his grenade—everything is compressed into a flat image on the hull plating. For a second, he is a painting of a screaming soldier. Then, the grenade detonates. The explosion disrupts the gravity core. The pressure wave vanishes.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Knuckles** — In the split second before the beam hits, he manages to raise his hand. He gives a thumbs up. It is his signature move. It is goofy, defiant, and heartbreaking. The image of that thumbs up is burned into the hull forever.

### Scene 3: The Retreat

- **Key Event:** The gravity lifts. Ria screams.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria scrambles to her feet. She runs to the spot where Knuckles was. There is nothing there but a scorch mark and the 2D image. She tries to grab it, but her gloves just scratch the metal. She howls, a sound of pure, animal grief that distorts the comms channel. She turns toward the Dodecahedron, which is smoking and damaged but still active. She activates her Titan-Form, her skin turning to steel. She wants to tear it apart with her bare hands.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria is blinded by rage. She has lost control. She forgets the mission. She forgets the retreat order. She only wants to kill the thing that took her brother.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen, watching from the airlock, realizes she is going to get herself killed. He uses a Shadow-Whip to drag her back.
- **Detailed Description:** A tendril of solid darkness shoots out from the airlock. It wraps around Ria's waist. She struggles, digging her boots into the hull, carving deep furrows in the metal. "Let me go! I can kill it!" she screams. Kaelen hauls her in, his face grim. He drags her through the airlock door just as the Dodecahedron fires another beam, slicing the empty space where she just was.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Let me go! I can kill it! He's right there! He's right there!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "He's gone, Ria! He's gone! We have to move! Don't make his death meaningless!"

- **Key Event:** The airlock cycles. Ria collapses, sobbing.
- **Detailed Description:** As the pressure normalizes, Ria stops fighting. She curls into a ball on the floor. Her armor is dented, her knuckles bloody from punching the floor. Kaelen stands over her, breathing hard. He doesn't offer comfort. He just stands guard, watching the door, knowing that they just lost their best soldier, and the war hasn't even really started.
