# Character Profile: Private "Rookie"

**Archetype:** The Student / The Innocence of War
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for glory, for battle, and for Ria's maternal approval).
**Virtue Mask:** ADMIRATION (His fear of Angelica is his shield against the unknown).

## I. Role in the Story

Private "Rookie" is a young soldier Ria is mentoring. He represents the next generation of the Vanguard, being shaped by Ria's "Iron" philosophy.

- **The Fear:** He is terrified of Angelica, viewing her as a "goddess of war" or a monster. He hides behind Ria when she approaches.
- **The Sting:** Ria ruffles his hair—a simple, warm gesture of affection she never gives to Angelica. This kindness toward the "Rookie" makes Angelica's own isolation feel even more profound.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Violent Loss of Innocence / Death. **Location: Book 4, Chapter 11 (The Fight).** During a raid on a cannibal camp, Rookie hesitates to shoot a child attacker. The hesitation costs him his life. He dies in Ria's arms, hardening her resolve.
  **Quote:** _"I couldn't... he was just a kid."_
- **Impact on Ria:** Ria is devastated. She blames herself for "allowing" a boy like Rookie into the Vanguard. Her leadership becomes colder and more focused on survival at any cost, as she tries to ensure no one else dies because of "softness."
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Moral Compass" is gone. The unit's lightheartedness dies with him. The remaining members become more cynical and ruthless, losing the last bit of humanity that Rookie’s presence provided to the squad.
