## Chapter 14: The Revelation

### Scene 1: The Capture / The Gallery, Museum of Pre-History

- **Key Event:** Angelica is pinned. Vane's nano-swarm holds her against the pedestal. She is bleeding from a cut on her forehead.
- **Key Event:** A drop of her blood falls. It hits the gold casing of the Cylinder.
- **Key Event:** _HUM._
- **Key Event:** The sound isn't audible; it's felt in the teeth. The Cylinder vibrates. The gold casing splits open like a blooming flower.
- **Key Event:** A beam of pure, golden light shoots up, hitting the ceiling. The light is warm, organic—completely unlike the cold blue neon of the Zenith.
- **Key Event:** The nano-swarm recoils. The tiny machines shriek and dissolve on contact with the light.
- **Key Event:** Vane shields his eyes, stumbling back. "What... what keeps this?"
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her blood acts as a catalyst for a power far older than the Zenith’s current technology, marking a turning point in the conflict.

### Scene 2: The Scan / The Gallery

- **Key Event:** The light expands, forming a hologram. It fills the room.
- **Key Event:** It isn't a map. It's a room. A bridge. The command deck of a massive starship.
- **Key Event:** A scanner beam sweeps over Angelica.
- **Key Event:** _Computer Voice:_ **"DNA MATCH CONFIRMED. SEQUENCE: ALPHA-ONE. WELCOME BACK, CAPTAIN."**
- **Key Event:** Angelica stares at the ghost of the bridge. She sees the chair. The empty Captain's chair.
- **Key Event:** She realizes with a jolt that the chair... fits her. The height. The armrests. It was made for someone her size. Her mother.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Seeing her mother in a position of original command bridge authority finally links her Undercity identity to her inherited legacy.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Cylinder:** "Welcome back, Captain."

### Scene 3: The Voice / The Hologram

- **Key Event:** A figure appears in the chair. A woman. She looks like Angelica, but older, sadder. She wears a blue uniform with gold piping.
- **Key Event:** **Elena Valerius.**
- **Key Event:** The recording plays.
- **Key Event:** "My name is Captain Elena Valerius. If you are watching this, then I failed. The mutiny... it succeeded."
- **Key Event:** The hologram flickers. "They want you to believe this is a city. That we are on a planet. It's a lie. The _Zenith_ is a ship. A Generation Ship. We left Earth three hundred years ago."
- **Key Event:** Angelica falls to her knees. The ground... isn't ground. It's a deck plate.
- **Key Event:** "There is no planet beneath us," Elena's ghost says. "Only the void. We are drifting. And the Architects... they killed us all to seize the bridge."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Elena Valerius** — Her message provides the definitive proof of the "Founders'" crime, revealing that the entire world of the Zenith is an illusion.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elena Valerius:** "The Zenith is not a city. It is still a ship. We are still in space... The 'ground' doesn't exist. There is nothing beneath us but the void."

### Scene 4: The Reaction / The Gallery

- **Key Event:** The recording ends. The golden light fades, leaving only the humming Cylinder.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at Vane.
- **Key Event:** Vane is on his knees. He isn't angry. He is... weeping.
- **Key Event:** He looks at the Cylinder with religious awe. Then he looks at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** "The blood of the Captain," he whispers. "It flows in the gutter. In _you_."
- **Key Event:** He laughs. A broken, maniacal sound.
- **Key Event:** "Sacrilege," he says, standing up. His face twists from awe to murderous intent. "And miracle. I must worship the blood... by destroying the vessel."
- **Key Event:** He raises his hand. The nano-swarm reforms, darker now. Sharper.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — His religious mania is revealed as he reconciles his worship of the "Captain" as a god with his intent to murder the living heir.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "The blood of the Captain flows in the gutter... Sacrilege and miracle."
