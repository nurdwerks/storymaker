## Chapter 17: The Null Raid

### Scene 1: The Breach

- **Key Event:** The Time.
- **Detailed Description:** It is 0300 hours. The "Zero Hour." The Scrapyard is quiet, save for the rhythmic, mechanical hum of Hatcher's recyclers processing waste in the distance. The camp is asleep.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** A noise comes from the North Gate. It isn't a bang or a crash. It is a hiss. A sharp, sustained sound of escaping pressure.
- **Key Event:** The Alert.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher, sleeping in his chair in the control booth, wakes up instantly. He checks the perimeter monitor. Static.
- **Key Event:** The Confirmation.
- **Detailed Description:** He switches to thermal. He sees the heat signatures.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** (Into the radio) "Movement. Sector 4. Perimeter breach. Wake up! We have guests!"
- **Key Event:** The Method.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks out the reinforced window. He sees the sparks. High-pressure plasma cutters. They are slicing through the three-inch reinforced bulkheads like butter.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher goes pale.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "They're not using guns. They're using the ship against us. They've tapped into the main plasma conduits. They've bypassed the safety valves! They're cutting us open with our own plumbing!"
- **Key Event:** The Entry.
- **Detailed Description:** The massive steel door glows cherry red, then white. It falls inward with a deafening _CLANG_.
- **Key Event:** The Invasion.
- **Detailed Description:** Shadows flood in through the smoke. Silent. Organized. Deadly.

### Scene 2: The Silence

- **Key Event:** The Defense.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen Night is the first to intercept. He drops from a crane gantry, his sword drawn, landing in a crouch between the invaders and the refugee tents.
- **Key Event:** The Expectation.
- **Detailed Description:** He expects shouts. Panic. Identifying war cries. The chaos of a raid.
- **Key Event:** The Reality.
- **Detailed Description:** Silence. Absolute, terrifying silence.
- **Key Event:** The Enemy.
- **Detailed Description:** The attackers—the **Nulls**—move in perfect unison. They wear sleek, black armor that absorbs light. No insignia. Their faces are covered by smooth, blank masks made of black glass.
- **Key Event:** The Combat.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen parries a strike from an electro-baton. The attacker doesn't grunt with effort. He doesn't flinch.
- **Key Event:** The Resilience.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen kicks the Null in the chest with enough force to crack ribs. No reaction. The Null recovers instantly, mechanics adjusting.
- **Key Event:** The Sense.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen feels a chill unlike anything he's felt before. Usually, he can sense his opponent's intent. Their fear. Their rhythm.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** (Yelling to Angelica) "There's no heartbeat! No rhythm! It's like fighting a door!"
- **Key Event:** The Flank.
- **Detailed Description:** **The Mongrel**, a fierce scavenger warlord who joined their alliance, holds the left flank. He is huge, swinging a massive pipe wrench.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mongrel:** "For the heap!"
- **Key Event:** The Kill.
- **Detailed Description:** The Mongrel roars and charges. A Null steps inside his guard with mathematical efficiency.
- **Key Event:** The Death.
- **Detailed Description:** _Thunk._ A pneumatic spear drives through the Mongrel's chest.
- **Key Event:** The Counter.
- **Detailed Description:** The Mongrel gasps. He brings the wrench down, crushing the Null's skull in a spray of sparks and fluid.
- **Key Event:** The End.
- **Detailed Description:** They both fall. Silent. The Mongrel is dead. The Null is deactivated.

### Scene 3: The Loss

- **Key Event:** The Swarm.
- **Detailed Description:** The raid is overwhelming. More Nulls pour in. They ignore the fighters when they can. They are targeting the civilians. They are swarming the refugee tents.
- **Key Event:** The Abduction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica fires her rifle, taking down a Null. She sees another one grab a child—a young girl with blue hair.
- **Key Event:** The Horror.
- **Detailed Description:** The girl screams. The Null clamps a gloved hand over her mouth. It drags her toward a waiting transport sled, moving with the indifference of a machine loading cargo.
- **Key Event:** The Choice.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica raises her rifle. She aims.
- **Key Event:** The Hesitation.
- **Detailed Description:** Too many civilians in the crossfire. If she misses, she hits a refugee.
- **Key Event:** The Plea.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria grabs her arm.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We have to help them! We have to stop them!"
- **Key Event:** The Command.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the tactical situation. They are flanked. Outnumbered.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We can't! They're taking them for harvest! If we stay, we all get taken! We have to save who we can!"
- **Key Event:** The Trap.
- **Detailed Description:** The vents overhead are closing. The Nulls are sealing the exits.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We have to go! Do you hear me? GO!"
- **Key Event:** The Sacrifice.
- **Detailed Description:** She grabs a fuel canister. She tosses it into the path of the Nulls. She shoots it. A wall of fire erupts, separating them from the captured refugees. She has to leave the child behind. The scream is cut off by the closing blast door.

### Scene 4: The Evacuation

- **Key Event:** The Escape.
- **Detailed Description:** They reach the emergency gravity shaft. It is their only exit.
- **Key Event:** The Status.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher punches the code into the keypad.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Bunker's compromised. They're in the walls."
- **Key Event:** The Destruction.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks back at his Scrapyard. His kingdom of rust. A Null throws an incendiary grenade into his main workshop.
- **Key Event:** The Explosion.
- **Detailed Description:** _BOOM._ Years of collection. His servers. His history. Gone in a fireball.
- **Key Event:** The Stoicism.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher doesn't flinch. He turns away.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "It’s just metal, kid. Metal can be replaced. Blood can’t. Keep moving."
- **Key Event:** The Jam.
- **Detailed Description:** A laser shot hits the console next to them. Sparks shower down.
- **Key Event:** The Hero.
- **Detailed Description:** **Scrap**, the little repair droid, beeps frantically. The shaft controls are jammed. A "Logic-Spike" virus is eating the code.
- **Key Event:** The Upload.
- **Detailed Description:** Scrap plugs his interface jack into the port. He uploads his own consciousness to override the virus. It is a suicide run for an AI.
- **Key Event:** The Opening.
- **Detailed Description:** The shaft door opens.
- **Key Event:** The Death of the Machine.
- **Detailed Description:** Scrap's lights go dark. He slumps over, an empty shell.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Scrap!"
- **Key Event:** The Push.
- **Detailed Description:** Aris pushes them into the shaft.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "No time! Jump!"
- **Key Event:** The Fall.
- **Detailed Description:** They jump. The darkness swallows them as they fall into the depths of the Undercity.
- **Key Event:** The Analysis.
- **Detailed Description:** As they fall, Aris speaks.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "They were perfectly synchronized. That wasn't a squad. That was a hive mind. Vane has achieved a local mesh network. We are outmatched."
- **Key Event:** The Grief.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher holds the lifeless metal body of Scrap against his chest.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "He's not a mesh. He was a friend."

### Scene 5: The Mandate

- **Key Event:** Imperial protocol invoked.
- **Detailed Description:** In the chaos of the retreat, Aris pulls up the Null unit's command log on a scavenged datapad. She finds the authorization code: a directive from the old Imperial archive, signed by **The Emperor** himself before his death—a standing order for the "reclamation of unauthorized population centers." Vane has been invoking the Emperor's old emergency protocols to justify the harvesting raids. The Emperor's legacy is being weaponized against the very people he once claimed to protect. Aris's face goes pale as she realizes the scope of what they're fighting.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "The authorization code... it's from the Emperor's archive. 'Directive 7: Reclamation of Unauthorized Populations.' Vane isn't acting alone. He has legal cover—from a dead man."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "The Emperor's been dead for years. His laws died with him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Try telling that to the Null units. They don't know he's dead. To them, the order is still active."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **The Emperor** — Even in death, his authoritarian legacy enables atrocities; his emergency protocols provide the legal framework Vane uses to justify genocide.
