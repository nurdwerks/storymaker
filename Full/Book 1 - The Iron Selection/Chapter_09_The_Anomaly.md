# Chapter 9: The Anomaly

The Observation Deck of the Spire was a place where silence was manufactured.

It was located at the very apex of the Academy's central tower, a spherical room of glass and steel that offered a 360-degree view of the Zenith. But the windows were polarized to a deep, opaque black. The only light came from the holographic tactical tables that dominated the center of the room, casting the faces of the men standing there in a wash of ghostly blue.

Headmaster Thorne paced the perimeter. He was a small man, nervous, his robes too heavy for his frame. He looked less like a leader of a military academy and more like an accountant who had discovered a rounding error that would cost him his head.

"It is a breach," Thorne muttered, his hands wringing together behind his back. "A Class-1 containment breach. We should have terminated the session immediately. We should have vented the chamber."

Prelate Vane did not look up.

He stood motionless over the main console, his gloved hands resting on the edge of the display. The screen showed a real-time biometric feed of Candidate Ward. Her heart rate was steady. Her cortisol levels were dropping. And overlaying her silhouette was a secondary signature—a complex, jagged waveform of mechanical resonance that shouldn't exist.

"Vent the chamber," Vane repeated, his voice smooth, like oil pouring over cold stone. "And destroy a unique data point? That would be... wasteful, Headmaster."

"It is heresy!" Thorne hissed, stopping his pacing to point a trembling finger at the screen. "That machine... that _thing_... it is Artificer tech. It is pre-Purge. It is forbidden by the Third Edict of the Iron concordat! 'Thou shall not grant false life to the inanimate.'"

Vane zoomed in on the image. On the screen, the gryphon sat on the girl's shoulder, its head swiveling to track a threat that the cameras couldn't see.

"The Edicts were written to prevent the rise of another Machine God," Vane said, tapping a key. "They were written to stop the creation of autonomous intellects. But look at the telemetry, Thorne. Look closer."

Thorne hesitated, then leaned in. He squinted at the scrolling lines of code cascading down the side of the display.

"Sync rate... 100%," Thorne read, his eyes widening. "That's impossible. Even the Gold Squad alphas only hit 85% with the bio-beasts. A 100% sync implies..."

"Total neural integration," Vane finished. "She isn't commanding it, Headmaster. She is _wearing_ it. She has bypassed the biological interface requirement entirely. She didn't use empathy. She used engineering."

Vane straightened up, a small, cold smile touching his lips.

"She found a backdoor in the universe," he whispered. "She is a Null with no magic, so she built her own."

Thorne looked terrified. "But the power source... Chrono-Gryphons require a Temporal Core. The Artificers destroyed the method of making them fifty years ago. That thing should be a paperweight. What is powering it?"

"That," Vane said, turning his gaze to the empty throne at the far end of the room, "is the question."

Lord Cromwell moved in the shadows near the throne. The Royal Observer had been so still that Thorne had forgotten he was there. The scratch of his mechanical quill against his ledger sounded like insect legs skittering on glass.

"The Emperor is watching," Cromwell's voice was dry, a whisper of parchment. "The Anomaly is noted. The deviation is... permitted. For now."

Thorne swallowed hard. If the Emperor was watching, then this wasn't just a school matter anymore. It was state policy.

"Permitted?" Thorne squeaked. "But the risk... if the Church finds out we are harboring a Class-X entity, they will burn the Spire down. The History of Ash is clear! 'That which eats time, eats God.'"

Vane sighed. He turned away from the console, walking slowly toward the terrified Headmaster.

"The History of Ash is a story we tell children to keep them afraid of the dark," Vane said softly. "The Artificers weren't destroyed because they were evil, Thorne. They were destroyed because they were competition."

Vane stopped in front of Thorne, towering over him.

"You see a monster," Vane continued, gesturing back at the screen. "I see a resource. The Zenith is failing. The energy grid is at 60% capacity. Our barriers are thinning. We are running out of traditional magic."

He leaned in close, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

"If this girl has found a new way to generate power—a way that doesn't rely on the genetic lottery of the Highborn—then she is more valuable than your entire Gold Squad combined."

Thorne trembled. "You sound like a radical, Prelate."

"I am a pragmatist," Vane corrected. "Radicals want to burn the world. I just want to keep the lights on."

He looked back at the screen, at the girl with the metal hawk.

"We will not burn her," Vane decided. "We will stress-test her. Increase the difficulty of her curriculum. Isolate her. Force her to rely on the machine."

"And if she breaks?" Thorne asked.

"Then she was flawed material," Vane said, dismissing the Headmaster with a wave of his hand. "We will observe. We will test. We will see if she controls the machine, or if the machine consumes her."

"Let us see what it eats," Vane mused. "Hunger always reveals the truth."

---

The morning lecture was a lesson in humility.

Professor Halloway stood at the front of the amphitheater, a diagram of a Wyvern's digestive tract floating in the air behind him. The room was tiered, with Squad Gold at the bottom, closest to the knowledge, and Squad Iron at the very top, closest to the door.

"Resonance," Halloway lectured, tapping the holographic stomach with his cane, "is not merely a connection of minds. It is a biological imperative. The beast must _need_ you. It must see you as a provider, a pack-leader, or a parent."

He looked up, his eyes scanning the rows until they landed on the top tier.

"Or, in some unfortunate cases," he sneered, "a paperweight."

The class laughed. It was a practiced, synchronized laugh, mostly from the lower tiers.

Angelica didn't react. She sat with her back straight, a datapad open on her desk. Aeon sat on the edge of the desk, perfectly still. He was powered down, in 'Statue Mode' as she called it, to conserve fuel.

"Cadet Ward," Halloway barked. "Since your construct seems to be absent from the realm of the living, perhaps you can enlighten us. What is the primary cause of Resonance Failure in Class-4 bonded pairs?"

Angelica stood up. "Incompatibility of delta-wave frequencies, Professor. If the pilot's cortisol levels are too high, the beast perceives them as prey, not a partner."

"Textbook," Halloway dismissed. "But incomplete. The primary cause, Cadet, is _fear_. The beast smells it. It tastes the weakness in your sweat."

He walked up the stairs, the tap-tap-tap of his cane echoing in the silence.

"Tell me, Ward. Does your machine smell fear? Does it have a nose? Or does it simply process data until it realizes that its pilot is a statistical error?"

He stopped at her desk. He leaned in, peering at the dormant gryphon.

"It's cold," Halloway noted, hovering his hand over Aeon's head. "Room temperature. No heartbeat. No breath. It's dead, Ward. You're carrying a corpse."

Angelica felt a spike of anger. Not for herself, but for Aeon.

_Threat detected,_ a sleepy voice whispered in the back of her mind. _Proximity alert._

"He's not dead," Angelica said quietly. "He's waiting."

"Waiting for what? Rust?" Halloway laughed. He reached out to tap Aeon's beak with his cane.

_Don't,_ Angelica thought violently. _Do not engage._

Aeon's eyes flashed—just for a microsecond. A flicker of red. The gears in his neck shifted with a sound like a cocking gun.

Halloway pulled his hand back, startled. He looked at the bird, then at Angelica.

"It moved," he accused.

"Gravity, sir," Angelica lied smoothly. "Loose joint. I need to tighten the cervical bolts."

Halloway narrowed his eyes. He stared at the gryphon for a long moment, searching for a sign of life. But Aeon was a statue again. Metal. Cold. Dead.

"Fix your toy, Ward," Halloway spat, turning around. "Or throw it in the smelter. We don't train statues here."

He walked back down the stairs. Angelica sat down, letting out a breath she didn't know she held.

_He smells like sulfur,_ Aeon noted privately. _And anxiety. Consumption recommended._

"No eating teachers," Angelica whispered.

---

Angelica didn't know she was being watched by the most powerful men in the city. She only knew that she was hungry.

The Mess Hall was a cavernous space, a brutalist cathedral of concrete and noise. Three thousand cadets sat at long metal tables, segregated by Squad. The air smelled of overcooked vegetables, industrial disinfectant, and the specific, sweaty musk of teenagers who had spent the morning fighting for their lives.

Angelica sat at the far end of the Iron table. She was alone.

Technically, there were empty seats on either side of her, but no one sat in them. There was a visible perimeter of exclusion, a three-foot radius of "don't look at her" that the other Iron cadets strictly enforced.

It wasn't because she was a Null anymore. It wasn't because she was Silt-trash.

It was because of the thing on her shoulder.

Aeon sat there, motionless. He didn't look like a pet. He looked like a statue forged from bronze and midnight. His feathers were perfectly still, his head held high. But his eyes—those glowing blue apertures—were constantly moving. _Whirr-click. Whirr-click._ Focusing. Scanning. Assessing threat levels.

Angelica looked down at her tray. A scoop of grey protein paste. A side of boiled synth-greens. A cup of water.

"Eat," she whispered, nudging the tray toward her shoulder.

Aeon looked at the paste. He leaned down, sniffed it—a sharp intake of air through his vents—and then straightened up. He made a sound like a printer jamming.

"I know," Angelica muttered, stabbing the paste with her fork. "It smells like wet cardboard. But it's calories."

Aeon clicked his beak. He didn't want calories. Angelica could feel it through the bond—a gnawing, hollow sensation in the pit of her stomach that wasn't hers. It was a hunger for something else. Something... energetic.

"What do you run on?" she whispered, taking a bite of the paste and trying not to gag. "Batteries? Solar? I can try to steal a power cell from the maintenance shed tonight."

Aeon ignored her. His head snapped to the left.

"He's looking at something," Ria said, sliding into the empty seat next to Angelica. She ignored the exclusion zone. She put her tray down—a mountain of protein paste and three nutrient bars.

"He's scanning," Angelica corrected. "Ria, you shouldn't sit here. The others..."

"The others are cowards," Ria said, taking a massive bite of paste. "Besides, I want to see the Tin-Can work. Does he do tricks? Can he open bottles?"

Jax sat down on the other side, his massive frame blocking out the light. "My Tiger won't even look at me today," he grumbled. "It just sleeps. I think it's depressed."

"It's conserving energy," Angelica said. "It's waiting for a threat."

"Well, tell it to hurry up," Jax muttered. "Halloway says if we don't get a sync score of 10% by Friday, we're on latrine duty."

Aeon hissed. It was a low, dangerous sound.

"Whoa," Ria laughed. "Feisty. What's his problem?"

"He's hungry," Angelica said.

Angelica followed his gaze.

Two tables over, at the Squad Gold table, a girl was peeling an apple.

It wasn't a synth-apple. It was real. Waxy, bright red, impossibly round. It was a luxury item, something grown in the hydroponic gardens of the upper spire, reserved for the sons and daughters of Dukes.

Aeon stared at the apple. The blue light of his eyes pulsed.

_Target. Energy density high. Volatile._

The voice in Angelica's head was faint, a whisper of static.

"No," Angelica hissed. "That's theft. Theft gets us the Box."

_Consumption required,_ the static insisted. _Systems critical._

Angelica looked at the apple. Then she looked at the Gold cadet—a girl with perfect ringlets and a uniform that looked like it had been tailored that morning. The girl wasn't even eating it. She was just holding it, talking to her friends, using it as a prop.

Angelica looked at her own grey paste.

"Fine," she whispered.

She stood up. "Tray return," she announced to no one.

She walked toward the disposal chutes. Her path took her past the Gold table. She kept her head down, her eyes on the floor.

"Watch it, Silt," a boy sneered as she passed.

Angelica didn't flinch. She just kept walking. And as she passed the girl with the ringlets, she stumbled. Just a slight trip, a mastery of clumsiness she had learned in the crowded markets of the Silt to pick pockets.

Her hand lashed out to steady herself against the table.

In one fluid motion, the apple was gone. Palmed. Accidental. Invisible.

"Watch where you're going, Null!" the girl snapped, brushing off her sleeve.

"Sorry," Angelica mumbled. "Clumsy."

She kept walking, the cool wax of the fruit pressed against her wrist, hidden inside her sleeve. She reached the disposal chute, dumped her untouched paste, and turned back to her table.

She sat down. She checked the perimeter. No one was looking.

She slipped the apple out of her sleeve and placed it on the table in front of Aeon.

Aeon didn't peck at it. He didn't bite it.

He lowered his head until his beak was hovering a millimeter above the red skin.

Angelica felt the resonance spike. It was a strange sensation—like static electricity building up on the back of her neck, but internal. It tasted like copper and ozone.

The air around the apple shimmered. It warped, like heat haze rising from asphalt.

_Initiating Chronal consumption,_ the voice staticked.

A faint _hiss_ emerged from the gryphon's throat. Not a biological hiss. Useable white noise.

The apple changed.

It happened in five seconds, but to Angelica, it felt like she was watching a time-lapse video.

One second: Brown spots bloomed on the perfect red skin, spreading like ink in water.
Two seconds: The skin wrinkled, collapsing inward as the moisture evaporated.
Three seconds: The flesh turned to brown mush, softening and rotting.
Four seconds: The rot dried out, turning grey and brittle.
Five seconds: Dust.

The apple didn't just rot. It _ended_. It went from fresh fruit to a pile of grey ash in the time it took to blink.

Aeon lifted his head. He fluttered his wings, the metal feathers clinking together. The gears in his chest spun faster, a revving sound of an engine hitting high RPM.

_Fuel intake: 0.04% capacity. Insufficient._

Angelica stared at the pile of dust. "Oh god," she whispered.

The Mess Hall had gone silent.

It started at her table and spread outward like a ripple. 100 cadets turned to look. Then 500. Then the whole room.

Halloway—the real Halloway this time, the Professor, who was monitoring lunch from the high table—stood up. His face was pale.

"What..." a Gold cadet near them stammered, pointing a shaking finger at the pile of ash. "What did it do? That's... that's necrosis! It killed it!"

Ria, who was sitting three seats down, leaned in. Her eyes were wide.

"Ward," she whispered. "What the hell is that thing?"

Angelica looked at the dust. Then at Aeon. Then at the hundreds of terrified faces staring at her.

If they knew, it was over. If they knew he ate _time_, they would disassemble him rivet by rivet. They would see him as a weapon of mass destruction, not a bond-beast.

She swallowed the fear. She forced her face into a mask of annoyance.

"Digestion," she said, her voice loud enough to carry. "He has a fast metabolism. Inefficient waste processing. He runs hot."

She swept the pile of dust onto the floor with her hand.

"It's just a prototype engine," she lied, looking straight at Halloway. "High thermal output. It cooks the food before intake. Basic thermodynamics."

Halloway narrowed his eyes. He didn't look convinced. But he sat back down. Thermodynamics was science. Science was safe. Necromancy was not.

"Just a prototype," Angelica repeated, petting Aeon's neck. Her hand was shaking.

Aeon leaned into her touch. _Deception detected,_ the voice noted. _Tactical necessity acknowledged._

Angelica grabbed her tray and stood up. "Come on," she muttered to the gryphon. "We're leaving."

She walked out of the Mess Hall. She felt the eyes on her back. They weren't just looking at the Null anymore. They were looking at the girl with the monster.

---

The corridor outside the Mess Hall was empty, or at least it should have been.

Angelica turned the corner, heading for the lifts, when a shadow detached itself from the wall.

It was the Gold Cadet. Lydia. The owner of the apple. She was flanked by two boys from Squad Silver—Calculus and a massive, thick-necked brute named Tor.

"You think you're clever, don't you?" Lydia said, stepping into Angelica's path. She crossed her arms. Her uniform was pristine, but her face was twisted into a sneer that ruined the perfection.

"I don't know what you mean," Angelica said, clutching her tray-bag tighter. Aeon shifted on her shoulder, his claws digging into the fabric of her jacket.

"The apple," Lydia snapped. "I saw you. You bumped into me, and then _poof_. Gone. And then your little scrap-pile turns it into dust."

She took a step closer. The two Silver boys moved to block the retreat.

"That apple cost ten credits," Lydia hissed. "That's more than your family makes in a month down in the Silt. I want it back."

"I can't give it back," Angelica said, backing up until her heels hit the wall. "It's... processed."

"Then you pay for it," Tor grunted. He cracked his knuckles. "Or we take it out of your hide."

_Threat Assessment: Active,_ Aeon's voice whispered. It wasn't sleepy anymore. It was sharp. _Target 1: Biological Female. High adrenaline. Target 2: Biological Male. High muscle density. Target 3: Biological Male. Calculation: Violence imminent._

"I don't have ten credits," Angelica said.

"Then give me the bird," Lydia demanded. She reached out, her hand glowing with a faint golden aura—a manifestation of her latent magic. "My father collects antiques. Maybe he can melt it down for scrap."

She touched Aeon's wing.

_Contact._

Aeon didn't just hiss. He shrieked. A sound like metal tearing against metal. His wings flared, expanding to twice his body size. The feathers, razor-sharp blades of vanadium alloy, locked into combat position.

His eyes cycled from blue to red.

_Protocol: Defense,_ the voice roared in Angelica's head. _Initiating Counter-Measures._

The air in the corridor grew heavy. The lights overhead flickered.

Lydia gasped, pulling her hand back as if burned. "It's... it's hot!"

_Target Locked,_ Aeon broadcasted. _Chronal Drain pending._

"No!" Angelica shouted, grabbing Aeon's body with both hands. "Stand down! Aeon, standby!"

The gryphon struggled against her grip. He wanted blood. Or rather, he wanted the time contained within their blood.

"He's going to eat us!" Tor yelled, stumbling back.

"Control your mongrel, Silt!" Lydia shrieked, her golden aura faltering.

Angelica looked at them. She saw the fear in their eyes. Real fear. Not the social anxiety of the classroom, but the primal terror of prey facing a predator.

She could let him go. She could let Aeon take a "sip." It would be so easy.

"Get out of my way," Angelica said. Her voice was cold. It was the voice of someone who held the leash of a monster.

Lydia hesitated, then stepped aside. The two boys scrambled to clear the path.

Angelica walked past them. She didn't look back. She kept her hand firmly on Aeon's chest, feeling the reactor core thumping against her palm like a captive heart.

_Disappointment,_ Aeon staticked. _Target was ripe._

"Shut up," Angelica whispered.

---

She didn't go to her next class. She went to the Library.

The Archives were located in the basement of the Spire, a labyrinth of dust and data-tapes that smelled of old paper and ozone. Most cadets avoided it. They preferred the combat sims or the gym. But for Angelica, this was home.

She found a secluded corner behind a stack of "Pre-War Agrarian Logistics" and sat down on the floor.

She knew the code. Everyone in the Silt knew that "Agrarian Logistics" was Academy code for "Things We Don't Want You To Read But Can't Bring Ourselves To Burn."

She pulled a heavy, dust-covered tome from the shelf. The spine crackled as she opened it. The pages weren't paper; they were sheets of thin, flexible polymer that had yellowed with age.

"Okay," she whispered, scanning the index. "Let's see who you really are."

She bypassed the chapters on crop rotation and irrigation. She flipped to the back, to the Appendix marked _Section X: Biomechanical Synthesis._

There were diagrams. Hand-drawn schematics of things that looked like nightmares made of clockwork.

_Figure 12: The Iron-Strider._ A walker unit used for heavy infantry support.
_Figure 14: The Whisper-Wasp._ A surveillance drone the size of a fingernail.

And then, on page 402, she found it.

_Figure 19: The Chrono-Gryphon (Class-X)._

"Class-X," Angelica murmured, running her finger over the faded ink. "Experimental. Sentient. Unstable."

She read the text.

> _Commissioned by the Artificer Guild, Year 204 of the Golden Era. Purpose: Temporal Reconnaissance and Tactical Entropy Manipulation._ > _The Chrono-Gryphon is not a biological entity. It is a closed-loop paradox engine housed in a kinetic chassis. It does not require food, water, or sleep. It requires Chronal Potential._ > _Warning: Unit is prone to Logic-Lock if not bonded to a stabilizer. Previous handlers have reported symptoms of acute psychosis, rapid aging, and localized time dilation._

"Localized time dilation," she whispered. "That's why the apple rotted. You sped up its timeline."

She turned the page. There was a handwritten note in the margin, scrawled in red ink.

> _Project Terminated. The hunger cannot be sated. They eat the future to power the present. Destruction of all prototypes ordered by the High Council._

"They missed one," Angelica said, looking at the small metal bird perched on the table.

Aeon preened his wing, ignoring the history of his own genocide.

"And they missed it because it was broken," she realized. "They threw you in the scrap pile because your logic core was seized. You survived because you were trash."

She looked back at the book. There was a schematic of the fuel system. It showed the Gryphon consuming a variety of sources: refined isotopes, high-yield batteries, and... _Organic Life Force (Not Recommended)._

"Not recommended," she scoffed. "Understatement of the century."

She closed the book. The dust motes dancing in the air seemed to freeze for a second, then accelerate, swirling in a chaotic vortex around Aeon's head. He was leaking potential. Even sitting still, he was warping the physics of the room.

She put Aeon on the table.

"Okay," she said, looking him in the eye. "We need to talk."

Aeon tilted his head. _Query?_

Angelica pulled a datapad from her bag. She brought up a calculator app.

"You ate that apple in five seconds," she said. "An apple takes about three weeks to rot naturally. That's... let's say 21 days. So, 500 hours."

She typed the numbers in.

"You consumed 500 hours of entropy in five seconds," she murmured. "That's your fuel source. You don't eat matter. You eat duration."

Aeon clicked his beak. _Affirmative. Chronal potential is energy. Matter is merely the vessel._

Angelica looked at him. She felt cold.

"If you bit a person," she whispered. "What would happen?"

Aeon didn't answer immediately. His shutters zoomed in and out.

_Biological entities possess higher chronal density,_ he staticked. _Estimated consumption rate: 70 years per minute. Target would expire instantly._

Angelica dropped the datapad. It clattered on the floor.

"You're not a pet," she said, her voice trembling. "You're an executioner. You could age a man to dust in a heartbeat."

_I am a tool,_ Aeon corrected. _A weapon is defined by its target. I have no target._

"Yet," Angelica said.

She looked at his claws. They were sharp enough to cut steel. But his real weapon was his hunger.

She should turn him in. She should go to Halloway right now and say, _'I made a mistake. I woke up a nightmare.'_

But then she looked at his eyes. They weren't cold anymore. They were watching her with a strange, intense curiosity. He was broken. He was dangerous. He was an outcast.

Just like her.

"You promise," she said, pointing a finger at his beak. "You promise you never eat anything living. Not a mouse. Not a bug. And definitely not a person. You stick to apples and... I don't know, old furniture. Okay?"

Aeon paused. He seemed to be processing the command.

_Protocol: Pacifist,_ he finally agreed. _Dietary restriction accepted. Awaiting input, Mechanic._

Angelica let out a breath she didn't know she was holding. She reached out and touched his wing. It was warm now. The engine was running.

"Okay," she whispered. "We have a deal."

---

The dorms were quiet.

It was 0200 hours. The ventilation system hummed with a low, rhythmic thrum that was designed to induce sleep, but to Angelica, it sounded like a dying engine.

She lay in her bunk, staring at the underside of the concrete slab above her. The room was dark, lit only by the faint green strip-lights along the floor. Eleven other cadets were sleeping around her. She could hear them—Jax's heavy, snoring breath; Ria's restless shifting; the soft murmur of Kila talking in her sleep.

Aeon sat on the foot of her bed.

He hadn't powered down. His eyes were dimmed to a low-level infrared, glowing like dying coals in the dark. He was watching the door.

_Target: Ria. Delta-wave activity detected._

The voice in her head was louder now with the silence. Clearer.

_She is dreaming of violence,_ Aeon noted. _High cortical output. Tasty._

He turned his head, swiveling toward the bunk on the left.

_Target: Jax. Subject is replaying a memory loop. Combat simulation failure. High anxiety markers. The flavor is... sour. Metallic._

Aeon's lenses zoomed in on the sleeping boy.

_Anxiety creates rapid chronal vibrations. It wastes time by replaying the past. I could eat that loop. He would wake up refreshed, with no memory of the failure._

"No," Angelica thought. "You don't touch their memories."

_It is waste heat,_ Aeon argued. _It is inefficient._

He looked at the bunk across the room.

_Target: Kila. Deep REM cycle. Subject is constructing a fantasy scenario. Flight. Safety. The energy signature is sweet. High caloric density._

He leaned forward, his beak opening slightly.

_Just a sip, Mechanic. Just the excess._

"Stop it," Angelica thought, projecting the words as hard as she could. "We talked about this. No eating dreams."

_Inefficient,_ Aeon grumbled. _The energy is radiating wastefully. I could skim the edges. One year of her subjective timeline would sustain my core for a month._

"And it would leave her lobotomized," Angelica countered. "We are not eating Squad Iron."

_Query: Squad Gold?_

"No."

_Query: Squad Silver? The blonde male attempted to damage the containment unit._

"No eating people, Aeon. Any people."

Aeon clicked his beak softly. It sounded like a padlock snapping shut. _Constraint acknowledged. Hunger remains._

Angelica rolled onto her side, looking at him. In the shadows, he looked less like a machine and more like a gargoyle pulled from a gothic cathedral. He was terrifying. And he was hers.

"Why me?" she whispered. "Why did you wake up for me? Halloway said you killed the others."

Aeon shifted. The gears in his neck whirred.

_The others were Noise,_ he staticked. _They pushed. They demanded. They projected 'Command' and 'Obey'. Loud. Incoherent._

He hopped closer, his metal talons gripping the blanket.

_You projected 'Fix'._

He tilted his head, his lenses focusing on her face.

_You looked at the broken parts and saw the whole. You are not a Pilot. You are a Mechanic. Mechanics build. Pilots merely drive._

Angelica reached out and touched his head. The metal was cool now, the reactor core settled into a steady idle.

"I don't know if I can fix you," she admitted. "I don't even know what you are."

_I am the Archivist,_ Aeon said. _I keep the seconds. I eat the moments you waste._

He looked toward the door, his head swiveling 180 degrees like an owl.

_And we are being watched._

Angelica froze. "What?"

_Proximal sensor alert. Heartbeat detected outside barrier. Range: 5 meters. Stealth protocols active._

Angelica sat up slowly. She looked at the door. There was no shadow in the crack. No sound of footsteps. But if Kaelen Night was out there, there wouldn't be.

"Is it a threat?" she asked.

_Target is... observing,_ Aeon analyzed. _No hostile intent detected. Curiosity._

Angelica lay back down. Kaelen. Of course. He had defended her in the Menagerie. He knew something about the old tech.

"Go to sleep, Aeon," she whispered. "Conserve energy."

_Sleep is for the biological,_ Aeon replied, but he tucked his head under his wing. _Standby mode engaged._

Angelica closed her eyes. But she didn't sleep.

She lay there in the dark, listening to the hum of the ventilation and the ticking of the clockwork monster at her feet. She realized the magnitude of what she had done. She hadn't just bonded with a beast. She had handed a loaded gun to a toddler.

She was holding a time bomb. Literally.

"He eats seconds," she whispered to herself, the words barely audible. "He is the most expensive pet in the universe. And I have to feed him before he feeds on me."

Angelica slipped out of her bunk. Her feet hit the cold floor silently. She moved to the door, listening.

Aeon was right. Someone was breathing on the other side.

She pressed the release panel. The door hissed open, sliding into the wall with a soft hydraulic sigh.

Kaelen Night was leaning against the opposite wall of the corridor. He wasn't hiding. He was reading a book—a real, paper book—by the light of the emergency strips.

He looked up. His monocle reflected the green light, turning his left eye into a glowing orb.

"You're loud," he said simply.

"I didn't say anything," Angelica whispered, glancing back at the sleeping cadets.

"Not verbally," Kaelen corrected. He closed his book. "But your mind is shouting. The psychic feedback from that... thing... is broadcasting on a wide-band frequency. It's giving me a migraine."

Angelica stepped into the corridor, letting the door slide shut behind her. "You can hear him?"

"I can feel him," Kaelen said. "It feels like a clock ticking inside my skull. It's annoying."

He pushed himself off the wall and walked toward her. He stopped a foot away, invading her personal space. He smelled of old ink and ozone.

"You need to shield your thoughts, Ward," he murmured. "If I can hear it, Vane can hear it. And if Vane hears it, he will dissect both of you to see how the transmission works."

"I don't know how to shield," Angelica admitted. "I'm a Null. I don't have psychic training."

"Then learn," Kaelen said. "Or die. The Curriculum doesn't care which."

He handed her the book he was holding. It was a heavy, leather-bound manual titled _Cognitive Ramparts: A Guide to Psionic Defense._ The cover was worn, the leather cracked from age, and the title was embossed in peeling gold leaf. It smelled of libraries that had burned down centuries ago.

"Read Chapter 4," he said. "It deals with suppression of non-biological resonance. It's technically forbidden reading for First Years, but I accidentally left it in the corridor. If you happen to pick it up, that's hardly my fault."

Angelica took the book. It was heavier than it looked. She could feel a faint hum coming from the pages, a residual psychic charge from whoever had written it.

"Why are you helping me?"

Kaelen adjusted his monocle. "Because you are the only interesting variable in this entire facility, Angelica. And I would hate to see you wasted on a dissection table before I figure out what you are."

He turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows of the corridor.

Angelica stood there for a moment, holding the book. She realized she was trembling.
