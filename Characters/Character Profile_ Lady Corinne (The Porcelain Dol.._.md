# Character Profile: Lady Corinne (The Porcelain Doll)

**Archetype:** The Influencer / The Socialite / The Spy **True Sin:** SLOTH (Not physical laziness, but *Spiritual Apathy*. A refusal to exert emotional effort, to care about the suffering of others, or to acknowledge the ugly reality of the world. She wants the world to be soft so she doesn't have to be hard). **Virtue Mask:** HUMILITY (She plays the "Silly Girl." She weaponizes incompetence and fragility so that no one expects anything from her, and thus, she is never blamed for anything. "Oh, I couldn't possibly understand politics, I'm just a girl").

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Artificial Flower

Corinne is the pinnacle of Zenith aesthetic engineering. She is designed not to function, but to be looked at. She is a living ornament, and maintaining that illusion is a gruesome, full-time job.

### 1. The Zenith Perfection

- **The Canvas:** Corinne is petite, standing 5'3", with a bone structure that is mathematically symmetrical. Her skin is poreless, airbrushed by genetic sequencing to look like alabaster. It has a slight, pearlescent sheen that reflects light flatteringly. She looks breakable.

- **The Hair:** She possesses a **Fiber-Optic Weave**. Her hair is not biological; it is a semi-organic filament grown from her scalp that can change color based on her mood or the ambient lighting. Usually, it is a pale, starlight platinum. When she is angry, it flushes pink. When she is terrified, it goes dead white.

- **The Eyes:** Her eyes are a startling, unnatural violet—a color that does not exist in nature, signaling her status as a "Designer Baby." They are wide and perpetually innocent, trained to look up through lashes that are long enough to cast shadows on her cheekbones.

### 2. The Cracks in the Porcelain (Physiological Toll)

Corinne’s magic requires the sacrifice of **Youth**. This means her appearance is a constant war between her natural age (19) and the supernatural aging she inflicts upon herself.

- **The Flash-Aging:** When she activates her Bond to charm a room or distract a guard, the cost is immediate. Crows-feet explode from the corners of her eyes. Her skin sags. Her hands develop liver spots. Her hair thins. For ten minutes of "Glamour," she might age five biological years.

- **The "Morning Face":** Before her treatments, she looks like a woman in her forties—tired, grey, and lined. She never lets anyone see her like this.

- **The Tremor:** Maintaining the illusion requires immense caloric energy. She often has a low-blood-sugar tremor in her hands, which she hides by holding a fan or a wine glass with both hands.

### 3. The Transformation (The Apocalypse Look)

- **Book 1-3:** Pristine, untouched, glowing.

- **Book 4 (The Stone Season):** Without access to her "Rejuvenation Baths," the aging becomes permanent. She is a 19-year-old girl trapped in the body of a weathered 40-year-old. Her hair goes brittle. Her skin dries out. She becomes a visual representation of the Zenith's decay.

- **Book 7:** She stops trying to hide it. She wears her grey hair and lines with a new kind of dignity. She looks like a Matriarch, not a doll.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Corinne does not wear clothes; she wears costumes. Every outfit is a strategic move in the social warfare of the Court.

- **Restrictive Couture:** Corinne dresses to emphasize her helplessness.

  - **The Hobble Skirts:** She wears skirts so tight she can only take three-inch steps. This forces men to wait for her or carry her.

  - **The Gravity Heels:** Her shoes have no heels; they float on miniature anti-grav repulsors. They are unstable and require constant balance, making her look like she is always about to swoon.

  - **The Fabrics:** She wears fabrics that cannot be touched without ruining them—spun sugar-glass, holograph-mesh, and whisper-silk. This discourages physical contact (which she hates) while inviting the gaze.

- **The Fan:** Her primary weapon. It is made of razor-sharp bio-glass slats. She uses it to hide her mouth (when the aging hits her teeth), to whisper secrets, and in Book 4, to slit a Viral's throat.

- **The Mirror:** A small, compact mirror that is actually a high-end sensor suite. She uses it to check her "Aging Status" and to spy on people behind her.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Corinne is a master of "Weaponized Incompetence."

- **The "Silly Me" Laugh:** She has a practiced, musical laugh that she uses to deflect serious questions. If someone asks about the Silt riots, she laughs and says, "Oh, politics gives me wrinkles!" It is a defense mechanism to avoid taking a stand.

- **The Pill Popping:** Corinne is addicted to **Vita-Gummies**—chewable narcotics shaped like little stars. They numb the physical pain of rapid cellular decay. She pops them like candy during conversations.

- **The Self-Documentation:** She is constantly recording. Her contact lenses are cameras. She streams her life to the Zenith "Cloud." In Book 1, she treats the Rebellion like a fun new trend to blog about. Even as the world ends in Book 4, she instinctively tries to "frame" the apocalypse for an audience that no longer exists.

- **Touching Surfaces:** She runs her fingers over furniture, walls, and fabrics. She is checking for dust. She is obsessed with cleanliness because she feels "dirty" and "old" inside.

## IV. The Bond: Spectra and The Vanity Toll

Corinne’s magic is soft power. It is manipulation, distraction, and social engineering.

- **The Beast:** **Spectra** (The Siren-Construct).

  - **Appearance:** Spectra is not a solid animal. It is a floating, shifting construct of light and glass feathers, resembling an abstract Peacock or a Bird of Paradise. It is blindingly beautiful and hard to look at directly.

  - **Personality:** Spectra is vain and jealous. It preens constantly. It feeds on attention. If Corinne is ignored, Spectra dims.

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Covert Manifestation:** **The Glamour**. Corinne can bend light around her to look more beautiful, more trusting, or more terrifying. She can release pheromones that make people want to please her.

  - **Overt Manifestation:** **The Flash**. Spectra can detonate a flash-bang of pure light, blinding enemies permanently.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Youth (Cellular Decay).**

  - *The Cost:* To bend light, Corinne burns her telomeres. Every second of magic shortens her lifespan and ages her phenotype.

  - *The Horror:* She spends her nights in a **Rejuvenation Tank**, a coffin-like medical pod that painfully strips away the dead, aged skin and regrows it. It is a nightly flaying. She endures torture to look pretty for breakfast.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

Corinne is the granddaughter of **Joyce** (The Assassin/Spy Master).

- **The Grandmother:** Joyce raised Corinne after her parents died in a "Shuttle Accident" (assassination). Joyce terrified Corinne. Joyce taught her: * "The nail that sticks out gets hammered. Be the cushion, not the nail."*

- **The Strategy:** Corinne realized early on that smart women in the Zenith get killed (like her mother). Powerful women get targeted. But *stupid*, pretty women? They get protected. They get married to Dukes. They survive.

- **The Lady Vesper Rivalry:** Corinne’s life is defined by her feud with **Lady Vesper**. Vesper represents "Overt Power"—she is mean, sharp, and political. Corinne represents "Covert Power." They fight over party invitations, dress designers, and proximity to the Emperor. It seems petty, but in the Zenith, social standing determines who gets the best Rejuvenation treatments. Losing status means literally dying faster.

**The Inciting Incident (Book 1):** Corinne targets Angelica not because she hates her, but because Lady Vesper expressed interest in the Silt girl. Corinne intends to "claim" the new toy first to deny Vesper the asset.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 1: The Iron Selection — ***The Mean Girl***

- **The Action:** She befriends Angelica to use her as a prop. She dresses Angelica in the "Traitor's Red" dress.

- **The Twist:** She expects Angelica to cry and run. Instead, Angelica owns the look. Corinne is impressed. She realizes Angelica understands the game of symbols. She shifts from "Bully" to "Manager," helping Angelica navigate the press to annoy Vesper.

### Book 2: The Cipher of Sins — ***The Bystander***

- **State:** Angelica is a fugitive. Corinne publicly denounces her to protect her own status ("Sloth").

- **The Secret:** Privately, Corinne leaks the patrol routes of the Seekers to the dark web, allowing Angelica to slip through. She does this not out of bravery, but because the chaos is "exciting."

- **The Interaction:** When Joyce (her grandmother) is revealed as an assassin, Corinne’s world shatters. She realizes her "harmless" grandmother is a monster.

### Book 3: The Game of Gears — ***The Assassin***

- **State:** Corinne is Angelica’s handler in the Palace. She sees the brutality of Duke Grey.

- **The Shift:** Vesper threatens to expose Corinne’s "Rejuvenation Addiction" (claiming she is actually 50 years old). Corinne realizes the "Game" is lethal.

- **The Climax:** At the **Crimson Banquet**, Corinne is tasked with ensuring Angelica drinks a sedative. Instead, Corinne spots a poisoned cup meant for Angelica (placed by Vesper). Corinne swaps the cups. Vesper’s ally drinks it and dies. Corinne winks at Angelica. She has killed for the first time. She feels a rush of adrenaline that replaces her apathy.

### Book 4: The Stone Season — ***The Victim***

- **State:** The Dome cracks. Civilization ends. Corinne is useless. Her heels break. Her dress tears. She cannot walk in the mud.

- **The Rock Bottom:** **Ria** bullies her relentlessly. Ria forces Corinne to carry heavy water jugs. Corinne cries, begs, and tries to trade her jewelry for rest. No one cares. She experiences **True Suffering** for the first time.

- **The Turning Point:** A Viral attacks Ria. Ria is pinned. Corinne screams, grabs a jagged piece of metal (a broken high heel), and stabs the Viral in the eye. She saves Ria. She ruins her manicure. She doesn't care.

### Book 5: The Silent Void — ***The Survivor***

- **State:** On the Ship, Corinne adapts. She stops trying to be pretty. She starts trying to be *clean*. She organizes the sanitation and medical wings.

- **The Skill:** She realizes her social skills translate to "Logistics." She knows how to manage people’s egos to get things done. She becomes the Diplomat of the survivors, mediating disputes between Kaelen’s and Ria’s factions.

- **The Aging:** Without the tanks, she ages rapidly. She looks 40. She smashes her mirror so she doesn't have to see it.

### Book 6: The Architect of Time — ***The Matriarch***

- **State:** Angelica is gone. Kaelen is fighting. Corinne becomes the "Mother" of the ship.

- **The Role:** She raises the children born on the drift. She teaches them history, manners, and survival. She becomes the keeper of culture.

- **The Wisdom:** She realizes that "Sloth" was just fear of pain. Now that she is in constant pain (aging), she finds she is stronger than she thought.

### Book 7: The Final Resonance — ***The Saint***

- **State:** The final battle. The Aliens attack.

- **The Action:** Corinne does not fight with a gun. She goes to the medical bay. She sits with the dying. She holds their hands so they don't die alone.

- **The Climax:** When the **Planar Collapse** wave hits, Corinne stands on the bridge. She uses her Bond—not to charm, but to **Comfort**. She projects a massive field of calm, allowing the crew to face their end with dignity.

- **The End:** In the new world, Corinne is an old woman. She opens a school. She never wears makeup again. She is content to just *be*.

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Angelica (The Prop and The Idol)

- **The Dynamic:** *The Star and the Agent.*

- **The Evolution:** Initially, Corinne thinks she owns Angelica. "I made you." By Book 3, she fears Angelica. By Book 5, she worships her.

- **The Connection:** Angelica is the only one who knows Corinne’s secret (the aging). Angelica never mocks her for it. This kindness buys Corinne’s loyalty forever.

### 2. With Ria (The Beauty and The Beast)

- **The Dynamic:** *Mutual Disgust turned to Sisterhood.*

- **The Friction:** Ria represents everything Corinne fears: Ugliness, Poverty, Struggle. Ria hates Corinne because Corinne represents Waste.

- **The Change:** In Book 4, Ria carries Corinne when she can't walk. In Book 5, Corinne stitches up Ria’s wounds. They realize they are both "Body Horror" victims—Ria losing feeling, Corinne losing youth. They bond over the trauma of their magic.

### 3. With Joyce (The Shadow)

- **The Dynamic:** *Fear.*

- **The Truth:** Corinne spent her life trying to be "harmless" so Joyce wouldn't see her as a threat or a tool.

- **The Resolution:** When Joyce dies in Book 4 (defending the group), she gives Corinne her knitting needles (which are stilettos). "You were never silly, Corinne. You were just waiting."
