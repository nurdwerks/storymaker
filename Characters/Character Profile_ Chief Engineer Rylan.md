# Character Profile: Chief Engineer Rylan

**Archetype:** The Grimy Genius / The Technician
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views the Generation Ship as his own personal domain and "his" engine).
**Virtue Mask:** DILIGENCE (He frames his shouting and arguments as "Essential Maintenance").

## I. Role in the Story

Rylan is a grimy, brilliant engineer who argues with Torin about thrust ratios. He represents the spirit of cooperation and mechanical passion of the original Generation Ship.

- **The Technical Intimacy:** He and Torin wave blueprints and shout over engine noise, sharing a passion for the machine that Angelica can never share.
- **The Tourist:** Their shared laughter and "tech-talk" make Angelica feel like a tourist in her own history—someone who uses the technology but doesn't understand its soul.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** **The Reactor Breach.** **Location:** Book 6, Chapter 25 ("The Melt"). During a critical pre-launch test of the Warp Core, a seal fails. Rylan manually seals the breach to save the ship, but his legs are crushed and boiled by the steam.
- **Impact on Torin:** Torin is paralyzed by the realization that "his" ship is dying before it even launches. Rylan's injury is a physical manifestation of Torin’s failure. He stops being the optimistic architect and becomes a grim survivalist.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Spirit" of the deck is broken. The engineering team loses their boisterous, confident leader. The deck turns into a place of sterile, desperate repairs.
