## Chapter 15: The Dance

### Scene 1: The Tension

- **Key Event:** Angelica stands near the refreshment drone feeling exposed. The room is divided by invisible power lines: House Aurum (Gold) center, House Ignis (Fire) south, House Night (Shadow) in corners.

- **Key Event:** Corinne confronts Angelica with two sycophants, wearing a dress of woven light-filaments shifting to sharp, aggressive diamond-white.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "You're contaminating the aesthetic, Vance."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I wasn't aware 'pretentious' was a protected species."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Return to the gutter. Before I melt that scrap-metal dress to your skin."

### Scene 2: The Rescue

- **Key Event:** Corinne forms a small plasma orb at her fingertip, pretending to stumble as she aims it at Angelica's face.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night intercepts with a black-gloved Null-Field that absorbs the plasma.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Your control is slipping, Corinne. Discharging plasma in a crowded room? How plebeian."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I collect useful things. You, on the other hand, are merely decorative."

### Scene 3: The Waltz

- **Key Event:** Kaelen asks Angelica to dance. She resists but accepts. He leads with absolute authority while she matches his rhythm using combat training.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I don't dance."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It is a waltz, Vance. It is physics. Momentum, torque, and trajectory."

- **Key Event:** During the waltz, Kaelen explains why he helped: the Selection begins tomorrow, and he needs her functional—as his "wrench" to break the arena's gears.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "The arena is a machine, Vance. It will try to grind us into paste. I need someone who knows how to break the gears."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Do not mistake protection for affection. If you slow me down, I will leave you behind."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "And if you try to use me as bait, I'll weld your door shut."

### Scene 4: The Spell

- **Key Event:** After the dance, Corinne casts an Aging Curse at Angelica's back—a beam that would age her cells by forty years instantly.

- **Key Event:** Aeon (disguised as a silver hairpin) senses the chronal disturbance. He opens a tiny singularity that eats the spell, then feeds the excess energy into Angelica (caffeine-like jitters).

- **Key Event:** A nearby vase of flowers turns to dust from the displacement. Kaelen notices the Resonance spike but doesn't probe deeper.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance (thinking):** "Good bird."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "Delicious seconds."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Let the Selection begin. I'm ready to break something."
