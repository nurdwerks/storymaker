## Chapter 1: The Golden Cage

### Scene 1: The Palace / Sector 1, Imperial Suite

- **Key Event:** Angelica wakes up. The sheets are silk. The pillows are down. The air smells of lavender, not recycled ozone and rust.
- **Key Event:** She sits up instantly, her heart hammering.
- **Key Event:** She is in a room larger than her entire barracks block. Walls of white marble. Gold fixtures.
- **Key Event:** She isn't dead. She won.
- **Key Event:** But she doesn't feel like a winner. She feels like a trophy.
- **Key Event:** She checks the door. Locked. No handle on the inside.
- **Key Event:** She checks the windows. Armored glass. Outside, the gleaming spires of Sector 1 stretch up into the smog layer.
- **Key Event:** She checks the corners of the ceiling. Micro-cameras. The red LEDs blink lazily.
- **Key Event:** "A cage is still a cage," she whispers, pacing the room like a tiger. "Even if the bars are gold."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Despite the gilded surroundings, she immediately searches for exits, weapons, and surveillance devices.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "A cage is still a cage, even if the bars are gold."

### Scene 2: The Video Call / Palace Suite

- **Key Event:** The wall screen chimes. It activates automatically.
- **Key Event:** A face appears. Leo.
- **Key Event:** Angelica rushes to the screen. "Leo! Are you okay?"
- **Key Event:** Leo is sitting in a medical bed. He looks clean. His color is better.
- **Key Event:** "I'm fine, Angie," he says. His voice is clear, not wheezing. "They're treating me really well. The doctors... they have medicine we've never even heard of. The food is great."
- **Key Event:** He smiles. But his hand moves to his chest.
- **Key Event:** He presses three fingers against his heart.
- **Key Event:** The "Silt Bow." A gesture from their childhood games in the slums. It means: _I am captured. Enemy territory._
- **Key Event:** Angelica freezes. Her relief turns to ice.
- **Key Event:** "That's good, Leo," she says, forcing a smile. "Eat up."
- **Key Event:** The screen cuts to black.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stares at her reflection. "He's telling me to run," she whispers. "Which means I have to stay. They have him."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She recognizes the signal instantly, her relief at seeing him alive turning to cold fury.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo Ward:** "I'm fine, Angie. They're treating me really well. The food is great." _(His eyes flick down to his three fingers)_
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (to herself):** "He's telling me to run. Which means I have to stay."

### Scene 3: The Observation / Throne Room Antechamber

- **Key Event:** In a darkened room, Prelate Vane watches multiple screens.
- **Key Event:** He sees Angelica pacing. He sees her checking the vents. He sees her testing the glass with a heavy vase.
- **Key Event:** He smiles. It is a sterile, scientific smile.
- **Key Event:** "She searches for weakness," he murmurs to his aide, Magister Solon. "Good. The strong ones always do. They're easier to break because they think they can't be broken."
- **Key Event:** "Is she the one?" Solon asks nervously.
- **Key Event:** "The genetic markers are promising," Vane says. "But the spirit... that is what matters. The Vessel must hold the Architect's mind without shattering. She has fire."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Views Angelica purely as a scientific specimen and political tool, not a person.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "She searches for weakness. Good. The strong ones always do. They're easier to break."

### Scene 4: The Terms / Palace Dining Hall

- **Key Event:** The door opens. Wardens escort Angelica to the dining hall.
- **Key Event:** Vane is waiting. He eats a perfectly seared steak.
- **Key Event:** "Sit, Angelica," he says.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sits. She doesn't eat.
- **Key Event:** "Where is my brother?" she demands.
- **Key Event:** "Safe," Vane says. "Receiving the best care in the Zenith. But that care is expensive. And it requires... maintenance."
- **Key Event:** He leans forward. "Your brother's lungs are failing. It's genetic. We can save him. We can give him a new pair, grown in a lab. All you need to do is... cooperate."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the steak knife. She calculates the distance to his throat. Eight feet. Too far with the guards.
- **Key Event:** "Define 'cooperate'," she says coldly.
- **Key Event:** "Be the symbol," Vane says. "Be the winner. Smile for the cameras. And when the time comes... be the Vessel."
- **Key Event:** Angelica leans back. She picks up her fork. She eats.
- **Key Event:** It is an acceptance of the war, not the peace.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She accepts the terms without flinching, already planning how to turn captivity into advantage.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Your brother's lungs are failing. We can save him. All you need to do is... cooperate."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Define 'cooperate.'"
