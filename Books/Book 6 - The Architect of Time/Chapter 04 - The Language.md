## Chapter 4: The Language

### Scene 1: The Listening

- **Key Event:** The State.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica has been in the bamboo cage for three days. The novelty has worn off. She is dehydrated, her lips are cracked, and her skin is burnt from the relentless sun. The boredom is worse than the hunger.
- **Key Event:** The Guard.
- **Detailed Description:** Her guard is a young spear-man who sits cross-legged nearby. He stares at her constantly, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and fascination, as if she might explode or vanish.
- **Key Event:** The Strategy.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica decides to change tactics. Screaming brought her nothing. Threats were ignored. She needs data. She stops moving. She closes her eyes. She shuts out her own discomfort and focuses entirely on her auditory senses.
- **Key Event:** The Soundscape.
- **Detailed Description:** She listens to the village. The ambient noise becomes a map. She hears women weaving nets by the fire. The rhythmic _scrap-scrap_ of men sharpening stone spears. The squeals of children chasing a pig.
- **Key Event:** The Analysis.
- **Detailed Description:** She tracks the phonemes. The cadence. The rhythm of their speech. At first, it sounds like gibberish. Grunts, clicks, and sharp exhales. A primitive tongue.
- **Key Event:** The Breakthrough.
- **Detailed Description:** Then, she hears it. A pattern. A woman is scolding a child near the cage.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Woman:** "Na go da Zoon! Radz deir! Bad juju!"
- **Key Event:** The Translation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica replays the sounds in her mind, stripping away the accent, the slurry pronunciation.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ _Na go da Zoon. Na... No. Go... Go. Zoon... Zone? Radz... Rads?_
  - _Internal Monologue:_ "No go the Zone. Rads there."

- **Key Event:** The Shock.
- **Detailed Description:** Her eyes snap open. Her heart hammers against her ribs.

### Scene 2: The Pattern

- **Key Event:** The Focus.
- **Detailed Description:** She listens harder now, desperate for confirmation. She filters every conversation.
- **Key Event:** The Hunter.
- **Detailed Description:** A hunter returns from the jungle with a small deer over his shoulder. He greets a friend.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hunter:** "Big Flux today. Gud Eet."
  - _Internal Monologue:_ _Flux. Change? Movement? Good Eat._

- **Key Event:** The Teacher.
- **Detailed Description:** **Elder Corinne** (simply **Corinne** to these children), the Keeper of the Weave, points to the sky where the clouds are gathering. She is teaching a group of children, her voice raspy but clear.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elder Corinne:** "Ops watching. Make Comms."
  - _Internal Monologue:_ _Ops. Operations? Comms. Communications?_

- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica starts to laugh. It is a quiet, stunned sound.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ It's English. But it is English that has been chewed up, swallowed, digested, and spit out over five thousand years of devolution. It has lost its grammar, its structure, its elegance. But the roots remain.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Specifically, it's _Navy_ English. The slang of a starship crew. "Flux" for movement. "Rads" for danger. "Ops" for the gods—the ones who watch from above. "Comms" for prayer.

- **Key Event:** The Deduction.
- **Detailed Description:**
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering) "They aren't aliens. They aren't natives. They're crew."

### Scene 3: The Theory

- **Key Event:** The History.
- **Detailed Description:** The pieces of the puzzle slam into place. She remembers the history logs from the Academy. The _Vanguard_. The lost colony ship from the 23rd Century. It vanished in a wormhole anomaly. Presumed destroyed.
- **Key Event:** The Hypothesis.
- **Detailed Description:** They didn't die. They crashed _here_. Thousands of years ago. The survivors... they lost the technology. The machines broke. The batteries died. But they kept the words. The Emergency Manuals became scripture. The Captain's orders became commandments.
- **Key Event:** The Observation.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the guard with new eyes. He isn't a savage. He is the great-great-great-grandson of a flight engineer or a marine. He is wearing the rags of her own civilization.
- **Key Event:** The Fear.
- **Detailed Description:** For a second, a cold fear grips her.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Is this Earth? Did I travel forward in time? Is this the future of humanity?
  - _Action:_ She checks the moon. It's too small. The gravity is slightly off—lighter. No. This is another planet. But the lineage is human.

### Scene 4: The Conclusion

- **Key Event:** The Action.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up. She holds onto the bamboo bars. She waits for the guard to look at her.
- **Key Event:** The Gesture.
- **Detailed Description:** She points to the water skin hanging on his belt.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Guard:** (Grunting and shaking his head) "Na."

- **Key Event:** The Attempt.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica takes a deep breath. She shapes her mouth carefully, trying to mimic their thick, guttural accent.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Giv... Wota."

- **Key Event:** The Reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** The guard freezes. He drops his spear in shock. He scrambles back, staring at her with wide eyes.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Guard:** "U spek?"

- **Key Event:** The Command.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica nods slowly. She adopts a tone of authority.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I spek. Giv Wota. Ops command."

- **Key Event:** The Result.
- **Detailed Description:** The mention of "Ops" terrifies him. He trembles. He fumbles with the skin and passes it through the bars with shaking hands.
- **Key Event:** The Relief.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica drinks. The water is warm and tastes of mud, but it is the best thing she has ever tasted. It tastes like victory.
- **Key Event:** The Plan.
- **Detailed Description:** She wipes her mouth. She smiles at the guard. It is a sharp, dangerous smile.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Language is just code with bad syntax. I can crack this. I just need more data. And if I can talk to them, I can manipulate them.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Teacher?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Guard:** (Bowing his head) "Teacher."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Class is in session."
