# Character Profile: Pixel

**Archetype:** The Digital Youth / The Runner
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for the "cool" of the underground and for Lisbet's approval).
**Virtue Mask:** INNOCENCE (She claims her insults are just telling the truth).

## I. Role in the Story

Pixel is a young girl who works as a "runner" for data chips in the Underground. She worships Lisbet and represents the community that Angelica can never join.

- **The Scorn:** She sticks her tongue out at Angelica and calls her "The Glitchless," identifying her as someone who doesn't belong in the "real" (digital) world.
- **The Devotion:** She brings Lisbet candy and drawings, showing a simple, uncomplicated love that highlight's Angelica's own complex and lonely existence.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Forced Reality / Maiming. **Location:** Book 2, Chapter 8 (The Runner). Pixel’s cybernetic "eye" (her primary artistic tool) is forcibly removed by a Silt-gang who wants her digital art credits. She is left "blind" to the digital world she spent her life in.
  **Quote:** _"It's just hardware."_
- **Impact on Lisbet:** Lisbet offers to replace the eye with a standard Zenith surveillance model, but Pixel refuses, realizing that she has become a "vessel" for the very system she fought. Pixel’s cynicism turns into a quiet, suicidal despair.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Laughter" stops. The Underground loses its artistic voice, turning from a vibrant community of rebels into a cold, transactional network of hackers who no longer care about the "message."
