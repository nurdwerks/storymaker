## Chapter 05: The "Noise" Warning

### Scene 1: The Decode

- **Key Event:** Lisbet plays the decoded signal in the briefing room. It is a screeching, dissonant sound that causes physical pain.
- **Key Event:** The ship's AI translates the mathematical pattern into understandable concepts: "ENTROPY EXCEEDED. AMPLITUDE TOO HIGH. CEASE FUNCTION."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica** — She recognizes the specific cadence. It’s the same "voice" she heard in the Mindscape in Book 6.

### Scene 2: The War Room

- **Key Event:** The senior staff (Kaelen, Ria, Angelica) debate the meaning.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen realizes "Amplitude" refers to Life/Magic. The Entity is telling them they are too loud.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen** — He slams his fist on the table, cracking the holomap. The warrior in him wakes up.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "It's not waiting for an answer. It's a Cease and Desist order. For existence."

### Scene 3: Vane's Absence

- **Key Event:** The staff realizes Vane is not at the meeting. He has locked himself in the Command Spire.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Good. He would only try to sell us out."
