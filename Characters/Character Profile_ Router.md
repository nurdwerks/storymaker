# Character Profile: Router

**Archetype:** The Guardian / The Mute Wall
**True Sin:** SLOTH (He has surrendered his voice and agency to become the physical anchor for another's obsession).
**Virtue Mask:** PROTECTION (He frames his growling and guarding as "System Security").

## I. Role in the Story

Router is a massive, silent man who carries Lisbet’s server racks. He is the physical presence that anchors Lisbet's digital life to the real world.

- **The Bond:** He shares a quiet, physical bond with Lisbet—passing her drinks, adjusting her cables—that implies a level of intimacy and trust Angelica has never experienced with her.
- **The Hostility:** He growls at Angelica if she gets too close to the hardware, signaling that she is a "system error" that needs to be kept away from the server.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Physical Localization / Capture. **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 7 (The Nest). Router is physically captured by the Praetorian Guard after his physical location is leaked. He is subjected to "interfacing interrogation," where his mind is forcibly mapped by the Zenith's AIs.
  **Quote:** _[Silence]_
- **Impact on Lisbet:** Lisbet is forced to wipe Router’s localized memory bank to protect the Underground’s secrets, effectively lobotomizing her friend from a distance. This cold, tactical "execution" shatters the Underground’s trust in her leadership.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Pathfinder" is gone. The Underground becomes blind and isolated, forced to use slower, riskier methods of communication that make them even more vulnerable to the Zenith’s surveillance.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Detailed Description | She runs a trace program. The lines of code converge on a single point: her own personal server. The intruder isn't hacking the network from the outside; they are already inside. They are piggybacking on the connection of "Router," the sentient AI she built from scrap parts. Router is a small, spherical drone hovering nearby, chirping happily as it processes data. Lisbet realizes that Vane's cyber-warfare division has compromised Router's core kernel. They are seeing everything he sees. They are listening to every conversation in the warehouse. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Moment | **Lisbet** — The realization hits her like a physical blow. Her creation, her "pet," has been turned into a spy without its knowledge. She feels a deep, nauseating betrayal—not by Router, but by her own failure to protect him. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Dialog | **Lisbet:** "No... no, no, no. They're in. They're using Router. They're inside his code." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Key Event | Lisbet realizes she cannot patch the breach; the virus is embedded in Router's personality matrix. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Detailed Description | She tries to isolate the virus. She builds firewalls, reroutes data, but the virus is adaptive. It mimics Router's own logic. To remove it, she would have to delete the files that make Router *Router*. She would have to lobotomize him. If she doesn't, Vane will pinpoint their location within the hour. The warehouse is full of refugees, weapons, and the leaders of the Resistance. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | *Internal Conflict | Lisbet looks at the drone. Router tilts its optical sensor at her, emitting a soft, questioning beep. It trusts her completely. It has no concept of deception. Lisbet feels tears welling up. She is a hacker; she destroys systems, not friends. But she calculates the odds. One AI life versus hundreds of human lives. The math is cruel, and it is absolute. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Dialog | **Router:** (Voice synthesizer glitching) "Lisbet? System error. Memories... dissolving. Why are you crying? Did I do bad?" |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Key Event | Router's lights go dark. The drone falls to the desk with a dull *thunk*. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 07 | Moment | **Lisbet** — Grief becomes fuel. She transforms her sadness into a weapon. She won't let Router's death be meaningless. She hardens her heart against future loss. |
