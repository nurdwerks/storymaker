### Scene 1: The Bi-Core (The Womb of the Ship)

- **Key Event:** The group enters the Central Bi-Core.
- **Detailed Description:** The blast doors to the Bi-Core do not slide open; they are pulled apart by the group's combined strength, tearing through layers of organic webbing that have sealed the entrance. The room beyond is vast, a cylindrical cathedral running the height of the ship's spine. The air is hot, humid, and smells of copper, ozone, and amniotic fluid. The walls are not metal; they are lined with pulsing, translucent tubes pumping nutrient slurry. In the center of the room, suspended by thick cables and biological arteries, hangs a massive, throbbing mass of tissue—**The Mother**. It resembles a human heart the size of a shuttlecraft, but with a vaguely human face emerging from the crimson tissue. Wires and fiber-optics run directly into the exposed brain matter of the creature.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a physical sickness in her gut. The room resonates with a frequency that vibrates in her bones. It is the resonance of her own DNA. She feels a psychic "pull" from the mass, a sense of twisted familiarity. It feels like home, but a home that has rotted and gone wrong. She fights the urge to drop her weapon and walk into the mass.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother (Through Speakers):** "Welcome home, Daughter. I have been waiting for the cycle to complete. You are late."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "What are you? You aren't a computer."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "What are you? You aren't a computer."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "I am the Architect. I am the Gardener. I am You."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** (Staring at the pulsing cables) "It's a weave. Look at the patterns. Arteries knit into fiber-optics. It's not distinct; it's a tapestry. A horrible, bloody tapestry. I've never seen stitch-work like this."

### Scene 2: The Revelation (Elena's Legacy)

- **Key Event:** The Mother reveals her identity as Elena Ward.
- **Detailed Description:** A holographic interface flickers to life above the flesh-mass. It displays archival footage dated three hundred years ago. The grainy video shows Dr. Elena Ward entering this very room. She looks sick—hair falling out, skin lesions from radiation poisoning. She is dying. She climbs into the open bio-tank voluntarily, hooking herself up to the ship's mainframe. The footage speeds up, showing her body dissolving, expanding, and integrating with the computer. The face in the flesh-mass opens its eyes—eyes that match Angelica's exactly.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica's world shatters. The monster she came to kill is her own mother. The "Pathogen" wasn't an accident or an alien attack; it was a deliberate attempt by Elena to force the crew to evolve to survive the radiation leaks. Elena sacrificed her humanity to save the species, but in the isolation of the void, she lost her mind. She became a cancer.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **The Mother** — Displays a horrific, distorted love for her "offspring," viewing the Blighted as her "successful experiments" and the uninfected survivors as "failures" who are too weak to survive.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "The Pathogen is not a disease. It is a refinement. I was making you strong enough to face the void. Zenith was too soft. Skin is weak. Bone is brittle. I gave you iron and hunger."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You made them monsters. You took their souls!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "I made them survivors. Look at them. They do not freeze. They do not despair. They only feed. That is purity."

### Scene 3: The Hunger (Assimilation Attempt)

- **Key Event:** The Mother attempts to absorb the group.
- **Detailed Description:** The floor plates shift as tentacles of flesh erupt from the grating. The Mother decides that conversation is inefficient; she wants to "reclaim" her lost children. She targets Ria first, sensing the compatibility of her cybernetics. The tentacles wrap around Ria's legs, lifting her into the air. They try to drag her into the central vat of bio-sludge. Simultaneously, the Blighted drop from the ceiling ducts, hissing. They form a perimeter, cutting off the exit. They do not attack to kill; they herd the group toward the Mother.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria fights panic. The idea of being absorbed—of losing her individuality to a hive mind—is her greatest fear. She activates the plasma torch in her arm, burning the flesh that holds her. The smell of cooking meat fills the air. She screams in rage, refusing to be eaten.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I'm not on the menu tonight, Mother! My metal doesn't digest! Get off me!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "Join the chorus. Silence is lonely. Here, we are all one. No more pain. No more cold."

### Scene 4: The Resistance (Psychic Warfare)

- **Key Event:** Angelica engages in psychic warfare.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica realizes physical weapons won't kill a building-sized organism that controls the room. She spots a neural interface headset on a nearby console—left there by Elena centuries ago. She puts it on. The needles slide into her temples. She jacks directly into the ship's wi-fi. She attacks the Mother on the digital plane. Her mind slams into the Hive Mind. It is a tsunami of voices—millions of screaming, hungry thoughts from every Blighted on the ship.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica is drowning in the data. She feels the hunger of every monster. She feels the cold of space. She feels Elena's three centuries of loneliness and madness. She has to build a wall around her own mind to keep from being washed away. She uses her memories of Leo, of the Undercity, of her own name as anchors.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Connects directly to the Mother's mind, suffering the sensory overload of a thousand years of ship-memory. She uses her own stubbornness as a weapon.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I can hear the ship. I can hear the stars. It’s too much... it’s all screaming!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "Embrace the scream. It is the sound of the universe. Let go, Angelica. Be the ship."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. I am not the ship. I am the Captain. And I am relieving you of duty."

- **Key Event:** The Broadcast.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica finds the frequency the Mother uses to control the Blighted. She inverts it. She broadcasts a "Wake Up" signal. It doesn't cure them, but it breaks the hive mind. The Blighted in the room stop. They look around, confused. The coordination vanishes. The Mother screams—a psychic blast that shatters glass across the deck.
