  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **The Mother** — Displays a horrific, distorted love for her "offspring," viewing the Blighted as her "successful experiments."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "The Pathogen is not a disease. It is a refinement. I was making you strong enough to face the void. Zenith was too soft."

### Scene 3: The Hunger

### Scene 4: The Resistance

- **Key Event:** Angelica uses her neural headset to broadcast a counter-signal, temporarily paralyzing the Mother's influence over the local Blighted.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Connects directly to the Mother's mind, suffering the sensory overload of a thousand years of ship-memory.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I can hear the ship. I can hear the stars. It’s too much... it’s all screaming!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "Embrace the scream. It is the sound of the universe."
