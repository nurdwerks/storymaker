## Chapter 13: Mental Shielding

### Scene 1: The Lesson

- **Key Event:** The setting.
- **Detailed Description:** It is midnight. The location is Kaelen Night's private study in the House Night dormitory wing. The room is oppressive—dark wood, heavy velvet drapes that block all light, colder than the rest of the station. Shadows seem to pool in the corners, moving even when nothing casts them. Kaelen sits in a high-backed chair. Angelica sits opposite him on a wooden stool.

- **Key Event:** The attack.
- **Detailed Description:** There is no physical contact. Kaelen stares at her. Angelica feels a sensation like a cold needle being pushed into the center of her forehead. It is invasive, sharp, and violates her sense of self. It slides past her conscious thoughts and begins sifting through her surface memories like someone rifling through a file cabinet.

- **Key Event:** The critique.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen speaks without breaking eye contact. His voice echoes slightly in her mind.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Your thoughts scream, Ward. You project everything: fear, insecurity, calculus. A telepath could track you across the sector just by listening to the noise."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm trying to block you!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Trying is noise. Doing is silence."

- **Key Event:** The failed defenses.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica tries to visualize defenses. She imagines a brick wall. Kaelen smashes through it instantly; she feels the psychic debris scatter. She imagines a firewall of complex code. Kaelen bypasses it like a hacker with a master key.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Too rigid. Bricks break. Code dictates patterns. Patterns are predictable."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "A shield must be fluid. It must be water, not stone. Stones crack. Water displaces and returns."

### Scene 2: The Breach

- **Key Event:** The intensification.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen pushes harder. The needle becomes a drill. He bores deeper, past the surface thoughts, aiming for the Core Memories—the things that define who she is. Angelica gasps, clutching the seat of the stool. She feels him passing her childhood, her time in the Silt, her academic records.

- **Key Event:** The target found.
- **Detailed Description:** He finds it. A memory of Leo. They are in the Undercity. Leo is eight, sick with radiation fever, lying on a dirty foam mattress. He is shivering, pale, his eyes too big for his face. He whispers, _"Angel, I'm hungry."_ Angelica feels the crushing weight of her own helplessness, the desperate, terrifying love she has for her brother. It is her primary motivator. It is her greatest weakness.

- **Key Event:** The leverage.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen pauses, lingering on the memory. He tastes the emotion.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "A sibling. Leo. That is your weakness. That is the leverage point. If I wanted to break you, I wouldn't torture you. I would just show you him dying."

### Scene 3: The Backlash

- **Key Event:** The snap.
- **Detailed Description:** Something breaks in Angelica. It isn't fear anymore; it is protective rage. How dare he? How dare he touch that memory? It is sacred. The rage gives her focus. She doesn't build a wall. She grabs the needle.

- **Key Event:** The reversal.
- **Detailed Description:** In the psychic plane, Angelica mentally grabs the tendril of Kaelen's consciousness. Instead of pushing it out, she pulls it. She uses the connection he established—and the dormant blood pact between them—to surf the link back into his own mind. She floods the channel with her own Resonance.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "No! Do not—"

### Scene 4: The Vision

- **Key Event:** Entering Kaelen's mind.
- **Detailed Description:** The scene shifts violently. Angelica is no longer in the study. She is standing in a dark room that smells of copper blood and sweet gardenias. It is a memory. Kaelen is there, but he is a child—maybe eight years old. He is strapped to a chair.

- **Key Event:** The Matriarch.
- **Detailed Description:** A woman stands over the boy. She is tall, beautiful, and terrifying. Her eyes are solid black pools. This is Matriarch Lilith Night. She holds a soldering iron. Note: It is not a metaphor. It is a literal tool. The tip glows cherry-red.

- **Key Event:** The torture.
- **Detailed Description:** Lilith speaks to the boy with a chilling, affectionate tone.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Matriarch Lilith Night:** "You are too emotional, Kaelen. You cried for the puppy. Emotion is a leak in the hull. It sinks the ship. We must accept the necessary corrections."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Matriarch Lilith Night:** "I will cauterize the leak."
  - **Action:** She presses the iron to the boy's chest. The boy screams. Angelica screams with him, feeling the phantom pain of the burn. She realizes Kaelen isn't emotionless by nature; he was tortured into silence.

- **Key Event:** The ejection.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen roars. He throws Angelica out of his head with a blast of telekinetic force. The physical world returns. Angelica is thrown backward off the stool. She hits the floor hard. Kaelen is standing, shaking, clutching his chest where his mother burned him. His face is pale, his eyes wide with shock and fury.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Get out."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I saw her. Your mother. She... she tortured you. That's why you're like this."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "GET OUT!"

- **Key Event:** The shift in power.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up. She is shaken, but she isn't afraid of him anymore. She understands him. And she holds a weapon now. She knows his secret. Shadows cannot exist if you shine a light on their source.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Stay out of my head, Night. Or I will remove yours. Lesson learned."
