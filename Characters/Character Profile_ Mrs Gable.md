# Character Profile: Mrs. Gable

**Archetype:** The Fragile Citizen / The Weaponized Victim
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Choosing comfortable ignorance over the reality of the violence around her).
**Virtue Mask:** INNOCENCE (She frames her fear as "Protecting Peaceful Society").

## I. Role in the Story

Mrs. Gable is a sweet-faced old woman who knits alongside Joyce in the retirement home. She is the "perfect" cover for an assassin.

- **The Tactic:** Whenever Angelica enters, Mrs. Gable clutches her purse and looks at her with wide, fearful eyes.
- **The Label:** This reaction prompts Joyce to "protect" her friend from the "scary silt-girl," reinforcing the idea that Angelica is a monster whose mere presence is a threat to peaceful citizens.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Violent Awakening / False Flag. During a peaceful demonstration at the retirement home, Mrs. Gable is "accidentally" killed by a Silt-side protester (who was actually an operative hired by the Zenith to discredit the resistance).
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce’s "fragile grandmother" mask shattered. Her grief turns into a cold, focused rage. She stops being a retired citizen and starts being an active assassin again, hunting down the "Silt-scum" she blames for her friend’s death.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Peaceful Society" is revealed as a lie. The remaining residents of the home are terrified, turning the sewing circle into a group of grieving, paranoid elders who now view everyone from the Silt as a potential murderer.

## III. Book 4 Integration

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 22
- **Scene:** "The Protest" (The False Flag)
- **Role:** The Innocent Victim
- **Quote:** "Oh dear. They sound upset. Someone should talk to them."
