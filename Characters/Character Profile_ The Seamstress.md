# Character Profile: The Seamstress

**Archetype:** The Artist of Pain / The Maker
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for the "beauty" of the Night, and the visceral thrill of sewing it into reality).
**Virtue Mask:** ARTISTRY (She claims her creation of painful, beautiful garments is the highest form of "Love").

## I. Role in the Story

The Seamstress is a woman who creates the intricate, often painful garments and ceremonial armor for the Night family. She views the body as a canvas for the family's glory.

- **The Viewpoint:** She looks at Angelica with clinical detachedness, discussing how to "hide the Silt-birth" through draped fabrics.
- **The Pain:** She represents the physical cost of being a Night—the idea that beauty and status require suffering, a concept Angelica is forced to confront when she is "fitted" for her role.

## II. Book 3 Integration: The Broken Canvas

- **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 13 (Nightfall).
- **The Scene:** Scene 3: The Broken Canvas.
- **The Event:** During the seizure of the estate, The Seamstress tries to stop the guards from entering the wardrobe. She pleads to finish a hem on a silk dress.
- **The Fate:** A guard crushes her hands with a mace. "No further production authorized."
- **Status:** **Maimed / Useless.** Her hands, the source of her value and the Night's visual glory, are destroyed. She is kicked aside like trash.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Detailed Description | In the weaving room, he sees a guard smashing the loom of "The Seamstress," an old woman who has made the family's clothes for generations. The guard laughs as he stomps on her hands—the hands that wove the silk of Kaelen's first uniform. The Seamstress does not cry out; she just stares at her broken fingers. The cruelty is casual, pointless. It teaches Kaelen that power without compassion is just sadism. |
