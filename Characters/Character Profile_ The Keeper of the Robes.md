# Character Profile: The Keeper of the Robes

**Archetype:** The Wardrobe Master / The Technician of Illusion
**True Sin:** SLOTH (He aids in the maintenance of a comfortable, grand lie rather than facing the truth of the Emperor's status).
**Virtue Mask:** DILIGENCE (He fusses over the Emperor’s "image" with performative care).

## I. Role in the Story

The Keeper of the Robes is a servant responsible for the Emperor's clothes—and, more importantly, the holographic emitters that maintain his image. He is a key player in the Zenith's theater of power.

- **The Task:** He fusses over the Emperor's image as if it were biological reality, maintaining the illusion of a living, breathing ruler.
- **The Scorn:** He sneers at Angelica’s utilitarian Silt-wear, viewing her practical clothes as an affront to the "divinity" of the Imperial image he works so hard to project.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 30](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md)
- **Defining Quote:** "His hand still clutching a datapad that contained a broadcast code he never sent." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: SLOTH/FAILED REDEMPTION)

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 1 | Chapter 02 | Detailed Description | Standing on the catwalk, right where she lowered herself from, is a figure. He is tall, gaunt, and draped in the pristine, flowing white robes of the High Ministry. His face is a mask of terrifying serenity, but his eyes—his eyes are replaced by Multi-Spectral Oculars, glowing with a soft, predatory blue light. It is Prelate Vane. He isn't accompanied by guards. He is alone. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 02 | Detailed Description | Vane raises his hand. The skin of his palm ripples. A tiny, silver beetle—a nano-construct—crawls out from his tear duct, skittering across his ocular lens before disappearing into his robes. He is not just a mage; he is a host. The Legion Swarm lives beneath his skin. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 02 | Moment | **Prelate Vane** — Represents Gluttony (Minister of Charity). He consumes everything—information, power, biology—while pretending to give back crumbs. He is a black hole in white robes. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 02 | Detailed Description | Vane reaches into his robes and produces a single, crystal vial. Inside, a blue liquid swirls with bioluminescent light. It is the Grade-A Steroid solution. The cure. He walks to the waste chute—the incinerator shaft that drops straight to the planet's core. He dangles the vial over the edge. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 02 | Detailed Description | Vane tosses the vial. It arcs through the air. Angelica lunges, catching it inches from the floor. She clutches it to her chest, breathing hard. Vane turns to leave, his robes swirling. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 03 | Detailed Description | Prelate Vane watches from the entryway, unimpressed by the frantic display of affection. He stands tall, his robes immaculate amidst the dust. He raises a gloved hand with the casual motion of a conductor. A cloud of black micro-drones—the Legion Swarm—erupts from his wrist gauntlet. They swarm Angelica like angry insects, forming magnetic bands around her wrists and ankles. With a magnetic pulse, they snap together, slamming her face-first onto the cold metal floor. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 07 | Detailed Description | Lecture Hall 1 is a cavernous amphitheater built of polished marble and acoustic stone. It is designed to make the speaker sound like a god and the students feel like insects. The air is cold, conditioned to a sterile dryness. Professor Halloway stands at the podium. He is a relic of the old regime—skin as thin as parchment, milky eyes that see only what they want to see, dressed in the gold-threaded robes of a High Archivist. He taps a cane against the floor for silence. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 09 | Detailed Description | Aeon introduces himself. He is not a pet. He is an Archivist. A keeper of timelines. |
| Book 1 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | The center of the obsidian platform glows. A hologram generator spins up, projecting a fifty-foot-tall image of Headmaster Vane. He looks impeccable in his white robes, a stark contrast to the dirty, bloodied, and freezing candidates. Around the hologram, virtual screens flicker into existence, showing the broadcast feed. Millions of Highborn citizens are watching from the comfort of their floating cities. The "Iron Selection" is the highest-rated show of the year. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 02 | Detailed Description | **Angelica Ward** sits at the end of a long, obsidian table. She is dressed in the white silk robes of a "Candidate," but the fabric feels like a shroud. She is eating mechanically—a nutrient-rich algae soup that has been flavored to taste like roasted avian, but the texture is slimy and cold. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 13 | Key Event | Prelate Vane enters. He is wearing his pristine white surgical robes. He is pulling on a fresh pair of latex gloves, the _snap_ echoing in the silent hall. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | Behind them, the dust cloud in the gallery swirls. Vane steps out of the debris. He is untouched. Not a speck of dust on his white robes. He walks calmly, stepping over the shattered crystal. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | Vane stands at the edge of the shattered window. The wind whips his robes. He isn't firing. He isn't pursuing. He is watching. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | A section of the wall slides open silently. Vane enters. He is wearing pristine white robes, contrasting with Angelica's filthy, torn flight suit. He carries a datapad. He does not shout or threaten. He speaks with the calm, reasonable tone of a teacher correcting a student. He pulls up a holographic chair and sits down, crossing his legs. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | On the screens, they see chaos. Aristocrats in silk robes are stumbling in the dark, screaming for their servants. **Zephyr** watches the feed on a stolen datapad, cackling. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 30 | Detailed Description | The Chamberlain, an old man in velvet robes, cowers behind a pillar. The blast doors to the Throne Room have been breached. Through the smoke, he sees the "Emperor"—the figure he has served for fifty years. The stasis tank is shattered by a stray round. The preservation fluids leak out onto the floor. The body inside is revealed. It is not a sleeping god. It is a withered, desiccated corpse, dead for decades, hooked up to machines that simulate life signs. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 34 | Detailed Description | **Lord Cromwell**, the former master of industry, is now 'Laborer Class 4'. He is sweating in the humid recycling center, sorting twisted metal scraps by alloy type. His velvet robes are gone, replaced by a grey jumpsuit that is too tight. He grumbles, but he works. He knows the alternative is the airlock. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 09 | Moment | **Prelate Vane** — He enters the room not as a monster, but as a savior. He wears tattered robes that float around him, his movements graceful and precise. He walks through the crowd of infected, touching them, blessing them. They recoil in ecstasy at his touch. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | It is a community. Scavengers, outcasts, people who rejected the Emperor's rigidity and Vane's cruelty. They look up as Hatcher enters. They don't bow like subjects; they nod like equals. Among them, **Baron Gilded** sits hunched in a corner, wearing borrowed rags instead of his usual gold-threaded robes. His wealth is useless here—currency for a world that no longer exists. He stares at the floor, muttering calculations to himself, unable to accept his fall. Nearby, **General Ironwood** stands ramrod straight by the entrance, organizing the handful of Praetorian Guards who survived the collapse into a defensive rotation, giving the ragged survivors at least a semblance of military structure. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 38 | Detailed Description | It is **Prelate Vane**. But he is changed. He is no longer just a man in robes. He is wired into the ship's mainframe. Cables run into his spine. His eyes glow with the same blue light as the core. He is not angry; he is ecstatic. He smiles, a beatific, terrifying expression of pure joy. He has achieved what he always wanted: unity with the machine. He sees them not as enemies, but as lost children. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 04 | Detailed Description | Vane stands in the center of the room, wearing a heavy, rubberized butcher's apron over his ceremonial robes. His hands are gloved in black polymer, stained with fluids that iridescently shift color. He is working on a dissection table, moving with the manic, precise energy of a conductor. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Kaelen Night:** "A lighthouse warns you of rocks. Or, if the keeper is a bastard, it guides you to the wreckers. That isn't a map, General. It's a mouth. Friendly neighbors don't send logic bombs with their invitations." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 41 | Detailed Description | The cloud coalesces into a shape. It resolves into the digital avatar of **Prelate Vane**. But he is not alone. Drifting in the white static around him are the shattered, glitching fragments of **The Emperor**—golden shards of code that scream in silence. Vane is distorted, his robes made of scrolling red error messages. He swipes at the Imperial shards, trying to consume them for stability, but they are too corrupted. He has no legs, only a trailing tail of data cables that dissolve into nothingness. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 04 | Detailed Description | **Elder Corinne** (simply **Corinne** to these children), the Keeper of the Weave, points to the sky where the clouds are gathering. She is teaching a group of children, her voice raspy but clear. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 32 | Detailed Description | The enemy flagship fires a high-yield plasma torpedo. It detonates just off the starboard bow, overloading the ship's external sensors and flooding the bridge with blinding white light. The blast shields fail for a microsecond. Starla, staring directly at the navigation feed, screams. The intense radiation sears her retinas. She falls back in her chair, clutching her eyes, as the smell of ozone and burnt hair fills the air. Lady Corinne rushes to her side, her silk robes dragging in the dust, her hands steady as she checks Starla's vitals, but the damage is done. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 45 | Detailed Description | **Lady Corinne** steps forward. She is no longer the "Porcelain Doll." She has let her hair go fully grey, wearing it in a complex, regal braid. She wears simple, functional robes, and she is holding a toddler on her hip—one of the ship-born children. She looks at Angelica with deep, ancient recognition. They are the only two "Old Women" in the room now. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 01 | Detailed Description | In the council chamber, the atmosphere is tense. Vane sits at the head of the table, wearing his ceremonial robes, trying to maintain the illusion of control. He looks tired, his robes fraying slightly at the cuffs—a symbol of the ship's decay. Lisbet projects the sensor data onto the central table. The black void is stark against the star map. "The silence is approaching," she says. **Lady Corinne** sits to Vane's right, sipping tea from a chipped porcelain cup. She is the only one who looks composed, though her knuckles are white as she grips the saucer. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 03 | Detailed Description | The broadcast overrides every screen on the *Aeterna*, from the massive displays in the Promenade to the personal datapads of the crew. Vane appears in his full ceremonial regalia, the gold and white robes of the High Council. The image is crisp, filtered to remove the sweat from his brow and the dark circles under his eyes. He stands before a stylized backdrop of the ship's logo, projecting an image of absolute stability. He addresses the "anomaly" (the Sphere) not as a threat, but as a "Traveler" or a "Test." He claims he is in active negotiations with the entity and that the silence is merely a "cultural difference," a pause before the exchange of wisdom. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Vane's face appears on the main viewscreen. He is no longer the composed scientist. He is frantic. His white robes are stained with the blue blood of a dissected alien. Behind him, the Biolab is in chaos, with his assistants packing samples into crates. He screams at Angelica, his voice distorted by the static of the jamming field. He demands she open the blast doors so his "specimens" can be moved to the bridge for safety. He claims his research is the only thing that matters, that the crew are expendable "biomass." |
| Book 7 | Chapter 20 | Detailed Description | The Engineering Deck is a labyrinth of steam pipes, coolant tanks, and massive power conduits that hum with the energy of the ship's reactor. The Tech-Priests, their robes stained with grease and their eyes glowing with the blue light of the control chips, move with synchronized efficiency. They do not use computer overrides; they use thermal lances. They gather around the primary power trunk line that feeds the Command Spire. With no hesitation, they ignite their lances. The superheated plasma slices through the thick insulation layers, melting the copper and gold filaments inside. Sparks shower the deck like fireworks. The hum of the reactor pitch-shifts into a groan as the load becomes unbalanced. Alarms begin to scream, but the Priests ignore them, continuing to sever the "arteries" of the ship until the main conduit hangs loose, sparking and dead. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | The corridor outside the bridge is a scene of industrial violence. Vane, usually pristine in his white robes, is now a figure of chaotic purpose. He holds the heavy, two-handed plasma torch with unnatural ease, his cybernetic strength compensating for the recoil. The beam of the cutter is blindingly bright, turning the reinforced tritanium of the blast doors into molten slag. Sparks cascade over him, singing his robes, but he ignores them. The sound is a deafening, high-pitched scream of metal being vaporized. Behind him, his Loyalist Peacekeepers stand nervously, weapons trained on the door, terrified of the man they are following. The heat in the hallway is intense enough to blister paint, but Vane does not sweat; his internal cooling systems are running at maximum. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | Vane enters the bridge. He drops the plasma cutter, the heavy tool clanging on the deck. He spreads his arms wide. He looks less like a conqueror and more like a messiah who has walked through hell to bring good news. His robes are ruined, his skin is grey and translucent, and his eyes are wide, unblinking orbs of milky white. He is unarmed, save for the swarm of nano-machines buzzing invisibly around him. He smiles—a stretched, rictus grin that exposes his teeth. The smoke from the breach swirls around him like a halo. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 23 | Detailed Description | Vane enters. He is unarmed. He wears his ceremonial white robes, but they are stained with coolant, oil, and the black residue of his Nano-Swarm. He looks manic, his eyes wide and unblinking, his skin translucent and stretched tight over his skull. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 23 | Detailed Description | His robes fall to the floor in a heap, empty. His cybernetic implants clatter to the deck plates—metal without a master. The Nano-Swarm, suddenly leaderless, goes inert, falling like black dust. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | Vane screams, a sound that is cut short as his vocal cords disintegrate into static. The process is not painful in the biological sense; it is a rapid, systematic disassembly. His skin, translucent and scarred by Prima-Materia, peels away in layers of binary code—literally 1s and 0s of blue light that float upward into the vacuum. His bones, reinforced with carbon-fiber, turn into perfect geometric shapes—triangles, circles, squares—before vanishing. The Nano-Swarm inside him, sensing the host's destruction, attempts to flee. Millions of microscopic machines burst from his pores, but the violet light catches them. They freeze, their tiny wings vibrating, before they too are converted into raw data and absorbed by the Cube. Vane's ceremonial robes fall to the deck, empty and pristine, as the man inside them ceases to exist. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 24 | Key Event | The bridge falls silent. There is no ash, no blood, no body. Just the empty robes and the hum of the Cube. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | The Zealots, heavily modified soldiers with blue-glowing eyes, stand frozen. Their neural chips were linked to Vane's "Hive Queen" apparatus. With the Queen destroyed, their chain of command is severed. They look at the empty robes, then at each other. Confusion replaces fanaticism. Some drop their weapons, the clatter loud in the silence. Others fall to their knees, clutching their heads as the neural feedback from Vane's death hits them. One soldier rips his helmet off, vomiting clear fluid. They are no longer an army; they are broken toys. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 24 | Moment | **Angelica Ward** — She walks out from cover. She doesn't shout. She doesn't celebrate. She simply walks to the center of the room, stepping over the discarded plasma cutter. She looks at the empty robes. She feels... nothing. No triumph. Just the exhaustion of a long, ugly job finally finished. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 24 | Moment | **Ria** — She lowers her weapon. She walks over to Vane's robes and kicks them. There is nothing inside. She spits on the fabric. It is a gesture of supreme disrespect, but also of closure. The monster is gone. |
