## Chapter 25: The Monster

### Scene 1: The Decontamination

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron is separated at the Zenith processing center—blindingly white, sterile, the opposite of the Arena.

- **Key Event:** Angelica is pushed into a decontamination pod. When she tries to hide Aeon, a robotic arm reaches for him. She screams and tries to bite the arm. Sedative gas knocks her unconscious.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't touch him!"

---

### Scene 2: The Audience

- **Key Event:** Angelica is thrown into Headmaster Vane's glass office in a grey jumpsuit. Kaelen (pristine black uniform) and Ria (gleaming chrome polish) are already there.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Where is Aeon?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "The toy is being analyzed. It is harmless. You, however... are not."

- **Key Event:** Vane reveals he watched her broadcast. The ratings were the highest in Zenith history.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It... it was still a show?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "Everything is a show, Miss Ward. The struggle. The defiance. The hope. It's all part of the narrative. The Highborns love a rebel... especially one they own."

### Scene 3: The Truth

- **Key Event:** Vane explains the Selection's true purpose: not to find the strongest, but to CREATE them.

- **Key Event:** Vane points out what each has become: Kaelen was a soft tactician, now a killer; Ria was a scared girl hiding behind armor, now she IS the armor; Angelica was nothing, now commands loyalty of a Night heir and a Cyborg.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "I didn't want survivors. I wanted monsters. And look at you. You are beautiful."

---

### Scene 4: The Badge

- **Key Event:** Vane tosses three heavy dark iron badges—Iron Rank. They are now Zenith citizens with rations, quarters, and power.

- **Key Event:** Leo has been moved to Priority Alpha care. As long as Angelica serves, he lives.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "As long as you serve... he lives."

- **Key Event:** All three take the badges—feeling like shackles.

---

### Scene 5: The Epilogue

- **Key Event:** Angelica stands on the Observation Deck with Aeon returned to her shoulder. The Zenith is beautiful but she now knows it's a cage.

- **Key Event:** Vane thinks he bought them, thinks he made controllable monsters. He is half right—he made monsters. But monsters don't have masters.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "What now?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We rest?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. We survived the game. Now... we break the board."
