# Character Profile: Mr. Henderson

**Archetype:** The Suitor / The Relic of Normality
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views the world through a lens of outdated social rules and refuses to see the violence beneath the surface).
**Virtue Mask:** CHIVALRY (He ignores anything "unseemly" to maintain the illusion of a peaceful courtship).

## I. Role in the Story

Mr. Henderson is a retired clockmaker who plays chess with Joyce in the park. He represents the "normal" life that Joyce uses as a shield.

- **The Normalcy:** He brings Joyce flowers and ignores Angelica entirely, creating a domestic "bubble" that Angelica cannot enter.
- **The Contrast:** The gentle, domestic normalcy of their relationship is a sharp, painful contrast to the violence and isolation of Angelica’s life, making her feel like a ghost looking in at a party.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Discovery of the Lie. Mr. Henderson accidentally discovers Joyce’s hidden weapon cache while looking for a lost chess piece. He doesn't report her, but the "bubble" of their romance is permanently burst. He looks at her with fear, not love.
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce realizes she can never have a "normal" life. The one man who loved the "human" version of her now fears her as a monster. She pushes him away, choosing the cold isolation of her profession over the pain of his rejection.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Domesticity" is gone. Their dates in the park stop. The other neighbors notice the rift and begin to gossip, turning the social atmosphere around Joyce into one of suspicion and quiet judgment.

## III. Book 4 Integration

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 21/22
- **Scene:** "The Discovery" (Finding the Weapons)
- **Role:** The Disillusioned Suitor
- **Quote:** "The game is over, Joyce. You cheated."

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | The parlor is warm and cozy, filled with overstuffed armchairs and shelves of real books. A fire—holographic but convincing—crackles in the hearth. Around a low table, a group of elderly residents sit, sipping tea and working on various crafts. There is Mr. Henderson, a man with shaking hands and a hearing aid; Mrs. Gable, who is dozing off; and others. They smile and nod at the newcomers. The survivors are given porcelain cups of Earl Grey tea and plates of synthetic biscuits. The juxtaposition of their combat armor and the delicate china is absurd. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | *Internal Conflict | Dr. Aris scans the room, his eyes narrowing. He notices details that others miss. The way Mr. Henderson holds his teacup—with a grip strength that belies his tremors. The way Mrs. Gable's "nap" allows her to watch the door through slitted eyes. The "knitting needles" that are sharpened to a monofilament point. He realizes this is not a retirement home; it is a sanctuary for retired monsters. These are the elite of the criminal underworld, the ones who survived long enough to grow old. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Key Event | The illusion is shattered when Henderson drops a bag. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | Henderson stands up to get more sugar, his "frail" movements exaggerated. He bumps into a side table, knocking over Joyce’s large knitting bag. It hits the floor with a heavy, metallic _clank_ that no yarn should make. The contents spill out across the Persian rug. Instead of wool, out rolls a jagged combat knife, a handful of high-yield flash-bang grenades, and a compact sub-machine gun with the serial numbers filed off. The silence in the room is absolute. The "seniors" stop their activities instantly. Mrs. Gable's eyes snap open, clear and cold. Henderson straightens up, his tremors vanishing, his posture shifting into a combat crouch. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Dialog | **Henderson:** "Whoops. Butterfingers." |
