# Chapter 1: The Vacuum

---

### Scene 1: The Void / Mid-Air Descent

- **Key Event:** The world ends in silence. One moment, the Golden Palace is a fortress of light and music; the next, the gravity dampeners scream and die.
- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward wakes up falling.
- **Key Event:** It isn't a dream. The air is rushing past her ears with a roar like a jet engine.
- **Key Event:** She is spinning. The centrifugal force presses blood into her eyes, turning her vision red.
- **Key Event:** Debris floats around her—a cloud of diamonds that was once a chandelier, a silk tapestry fluttering like a dying bird, a guard's helmet spinning lazily.
- **Key Event:** Her heart flutters. Arrhythmia. The childhood defect from the toxic air of the Undercity.
- **Key Event:** She clutches her chest. "Not now," she gasps. The air is thin, cold.
- **Key Event:** She forces herself to focus on a fixed point. A large piece of structural beam falling parallel to her.
- **Key Event:** "I am alive," she whispers, the wind tearing the words from her mouth. "I am broken, but I am here."
- **Key Event:** She checks her limbs. Left arm numb. Right leg responding.
- **Key Event:** She looks down. Below her, the clouds are parting.
- **Key Event:** She sees the Spire. The massive, golden needle of the upper city has snapped. It is tilting, falling in slow motion toward the darkly glittering expanse of the Undercity.
- **Key Event:** It is the "Great Fall" the prophets whispered about in the slums.
- **Key Event:** "It wasn't a metaphor," she realizes, watching a thousand-ton slab of marble pulverize a Sector 4 hab-block. "It was physics."

### Scene 2: The Anchor / Debris Field

- **Key Event:** Something tugs at her waist. A cable.
- **Key Event:** She follows the line. It stretches taut through the debris field, disappearing into a cloud of dust.
- **Key Event:** She pulls on it. There is resistance.
- **Key Event:** Use the cable. Climb.
- **Key Event:** She hauls herself hand over hand, her muscles screaming.
- **Key Event:** She emerges from the dust cloud.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr is there. Hanging upside down.
- **Key Event:** His magnetic boots are locked onto a twisted iron girder.
- **Key Event:** He is unconscious. Blood trickles from his nose, defying gravity to float in red spheres around his head.
- **Key Event:** His cybernetic arm—the "gold and brass masterpiece" he spent ten years of bounties to buy—hangs uselessly, sparking intermittently.
- **Key Event:** Angelica grabs his combat harvest. She shakes him.
- **Key Event:** "Wake up, you shiny idiot," she hisses.
- **Key Event:** He doesn't stir.
- **Key Event:** She slaps his face. Hard.
- **Key Event:** "Come on. I can't do this alone. Wake up."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr coughs. He opens one eye. It is bloodshot.
- **Key Event:** He looks at her. Then he looks at the emptiness around them.
- **Key Event:** "Princess?" he croaks. "Did we win?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica laughs. It is a sharp, jagged sound.
- **Key Event:** "Look down, Zeph."

### Scene 3: The View / The Girder

- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks down. He pales.
- **Key Event:** The entire skyline of the Zenith is inverted. They are falling with the wreckage.
- **Key Event:** "That's... the frantic sector," Zephyr whispers. "And that's... my favorite bar."
- **Key Event:** He watches a floating island crumble into dust.
- **Key Event:** "There goes my tab," he mutters.
- **Key Event:** Angelica pulls herself onto the girder next to him. They sit there, two tiny figures on a piece of metal, falling through the sky.
- **Key Event:** "The engine stopped," Angelica says. "The resonance engine. I felt it. The heartbeat of the ship... it just stopped."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr taps his mechanical arm. "Systems are dead. My HUD is static. We're blind."
- **Key Event:** "We're not blind," Angelica points to the fires burning below. "We have plenty of light."
- **Key Event:** She watches the destruction with a strange sense of detachment. The Golden Cage is gone.
- **Key Event:** "We didn't fall from grace," she says, her voice steel. "We fell from orbit."

### Scene 4: The Realization / The Descent

- **Key Event:** The wind is picking up. The air is getting thicker. They are hitting the lower atmosphere of the ship.
- **Key Event:** "We need to move," Angelica says. "This beam is going to impact in Sector 12. If we stay on it, we're paste."
- **Key Event:** "Jump?" Zephyr asks. "Into that?"
- **Key Event:** He points to the swirling vortex of smoke and fire.
- **Key Event:** "Gravity damps might still be active near the floor," Angelica theorizes. "Or the trash nets. Either way, it's better than riding a meteor."
- **Key Event:** She looks at him.
- **Key Event:** "Ready to go home, rat?"
- **Key Event:** Zephyr grins. It's his old grin. Sharp. Predatory.
- **Key Event:** "Ladies first, Princess."
- **Key Event:** Angelica unclips her tether.
- **Key Event:** She stands up on the beam. She spreads her arms.
- **Key Event:** She leans forward.
- **Key Event:** Gravity takes her. She dives into the dark.
