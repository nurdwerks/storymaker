| :------------- | :--- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Angelica Vance | 1    | 1/2     | The profile states she was caught hacking in Chapter 1. In the text, she decides to hack in Chapter 1 but is actually caught and blackmailed by Vane in Chapter 2. This is a minor timing discrepancy.                                                                                               |
| Angelica Vance | 1    | 24      | The profile mentions the "Berry Gambit" and a threat to blow up the arena. The chapter summary describes a broadcast and a system hack, but does not explicitly mention "berries" or an explosion threat.                                                                                            |
| Angelica Vance | 3    | 24      | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** The profile states Duke Grey kills Leo Vance in Chapter 24 (The Slaughter), causing Angelica to snap and unleash "The Carving," liquefying the palace and crushing Grey. The chapter summary for Ch 24 describes a fight with cyborgs and Captain Thorne's sacrifice instead. |
| Angelica Vance | 3    | 25      | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** The profile implies Leo's death at the Palace triggers her transformation. Chapter 25 summary (Leo's End) has Leo die from a sniper shot while holding a door in Sector 10. "The Carving" is not mentioned.                                                                   |
| Leo Vance      | 3    | 24/25   | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** Profile says Duke Grey kills him with a sword at a "Red Wedding" (Palace). Text has him killed by a sniper while holding a door (Sector 10).                                                                                                                                  |
| Angelica Vance | 4    | 28      | **DISCREPANCY:** Profile says "The Mother" offers a world without pain/Utopia. Chapter summary depicts "The Mother" as a horrific biological mass attempting to "absorb" the group for combat data.                                                                                                  |
| Kaelen Night   | 1    | 5       | **TIMING DISCREPANCY:** The profile refers to the bridge incident (saving Angelica) as a "Pre-Book 1" inciting incident. In the text, this occurs in Chapter 5.                                                                                                                                      |
| Kaelen Night   | 1    | 25      | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** The profile states Kaelen kills the Headmaster in Book 1.

| Kaelen Night   | 3    | 24      | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** Profile describes Kaelen snapping during the "Red Wedding," ripping off his gorget, and slaughtering his own House guards to save Angelica. The text (Chapter 24 summary) only mentions Captain Thorne sacrificing himself to cover their retreat.                            |
| Kaelen Night   | 4    | 23      | **ALIGNMENT:** Confirmed Kaelen's physical collapse from anemia and the intimate scene where Angelica feeds him her blood to satiate the Umbra bond.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Kaelen Night   | 5    | 25      | **ALIGNMENT:** Confirmed Kaelen's desperate plea for Angelica not to take the throne, preferring a doomed fight over losing her to the machine.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Kaelen Night   | 6    | 14-45   | **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:** Profile states Kaelen ages 20 years, becomes "The General," and fights a losing war in the future. The text (Chapters 14, 43, 45) shows _Angelica_ is the one who aged 20 years while building the ship, while Kaelen remained on the _Zenith_ and stayed young.              |
