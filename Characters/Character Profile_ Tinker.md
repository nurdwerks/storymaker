# Character Profile: Tinker

**Archetype:** The Scavenger Genius / The Maker
**True Sin:** ENVY (He hates the polished technology of the Zenith because he knows he could have made it better if he hadn't been born in the Silt).
**Virtue Mask:** COMPASSION (He claims his mechanical fixes are "Community Service").

## I. Role in the Story

Tinker is a one-armed mechanic who can fix anything with a piece of wire and a prayer. He represents the survivalist ingenuity of the Silt population.

- **The Tech-Bond:** He and Hatcher spend hours tinkering with Hatcher’s mechanical limbs, sharing a silent language of gears and grease.
- **The Contempt:** He scoffs at Angelica’s magic as "airy-fairy nonsense that doesn't fix a broken pipe," reinforcing the idea that in the Silt, only physical reality matters.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Absolute Failure / Maiming. Tinker attempts to fix a high-pressure primary conduit to save the crew’s camp. The pipe bursts, and Tinker loses his remaining arm in the explosion. He is left alive but permanently unable to practice his craft.
- **Impact on Hatcher:** Hatcher feels a deep, agonizing guilt. He realizes that Tinker’s mechanical genius was the only thing keeping them "alive" in the Silt. He becomes obsessed with finding a way to restore Tinker, leading him into a dangerous alliance with Prelate Vane.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Maker" is broken. Without Tinker to fix their gear, the Null Crew’s equipment begins to fail rapidly, turning their existence into a desperate, daily struggle against the encroaching silence of the Silt.

## III. Book 4 Integration (The Stone Season)

- **Location:** Chapter 16 ("The Scrapyard")
- **Scene:** "The Burst." Tinker loses his remaining arm trying to stabilize a pressure valve to keep the camp warm.
- **Role:** The Broken Maker. His maiming signifies the loss of Hatcher’s ability to "fix" things.
- **Quote:** _"I fixed it, Hatcher. The pressure is... stable."_
