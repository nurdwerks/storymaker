# Character Profile: Lady Septima

**Archetype:** The Matriarch / The Fossil
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Moral and social apathy; she refuses to acknowledge the reality of anyone outside her class).
**Virtue Mask:** MATERNITY (She poses as a doting mother figure to Grey).

## I. Role in the Story

Lady Septima is an elderly matriarch of a minor house who acts as a surrogate mother figure for Duke Grey. She is the keeper of "Old Blood" traditions and views the world through a lens of rigid class hierarchy.

- **The Erasure:** She treats Angelica as if she were a piece of furniture that spoils the room's decor, ignoring her completely in every conversation.
- **The Contrast:** Her warm, doting care for Valerius highlights the cold isolation Angelica suffers, reinforcing the idea that Angelica is an object to be used, not a person to be loved.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 15: The Game of Gears](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1270-1290)
- **Defining Quote:** "The past is an unnecessary weight." (Spoken by Grey upon her death, reveals flaw: SLOTH/APATHY toward the human connection)
