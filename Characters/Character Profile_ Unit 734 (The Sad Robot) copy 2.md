# Character Profile: Unit 734 (The Sad Robot)

**Archetype:** The Moral Compass / The C-3PO **True Sin:** SLOTH (He is a utility droid who has hacked his own governor chip to feel "Ennui." He resents every task. He wants to be in sleep mode). **Virtue Mask:** DILIGENCE (He does the work anyway, because his base code compels him. He is the most reliable character in the series, despite his complaints).

## I. Appearance: The Rust Bucket

Unit 734 is a "Service Droid Model 7," a common Undercity labor bot.

- **The Chassis:** Battered, dented, and covered in graffiti. He has one blue optical sensor and one red (a replacement from a security bot).

- **The Limbs:** His servos whine loudly. **Zephyr** refuses to oil him because "The squeak lets me know where you are."

- **The Graffiti:** Someone spray-painted "NOT SCRAP" on his chest plate.

## II. Role & Dynamics

- **With Zephyr:** 734 is Zephyr’s conscience. When Zephyr wants to leave Angelica, 734 calculates the odds of her survival as "Zero." Zephyr stays just to prove the math wrong.

- **With Lisbet:** Lisbet treats 734 like a grandfather. She patches his code. She gives him better subroutines. In return, he lets her use his battery to charge her deck.
