## Chapter 12: The Signal

### Scene 1: The Radio / The Peak

- **Key Event:** The wind howls at the top of the jagged peak.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sits cross-legged on the stone. Her fingers are raw and bleeding.
- **Key Event:** In front of her is a monstrosity of engineering. A "spark-gap transmitter."
- **Key Event:** She built it from cannibalized suit servos, copper from the escape pod, and lemon-acid batteries she harvested from the local fruit.
- **Key Event:** It looks like garbage. It is the most advanced piece of technology on the planet.
- **Key Event:** She taps the key. _Dit-dit-dah._
- **Key Event:** A spark jumps the gap. Blue and angry.
- **Key Event:** "S... O... S..." she whispers.
- **Key Event:** She repeats it. Again. Again.
- **Key Event:** "This is Flight Officer Angelica Ward. _Aeterna_ Survivor. Please respond."
- **Key Event:** The words dissolve into the wind.

### Scene 2: The Static / The Peak

- **Key Event:** She puts on the headset—two cracked speakers held together with vines.
- **Key Event:** She listens for a reply.
- **Key Event:** What she expects: A rescue beacon. A friendly voice. "We read you, Ward."
- **Key Event:** What she hears: _Hiss. Pop. Whine._
- **Key Event:** Cosmic background radiation. The scream of the sun. The atmospheric noise of a chaotic, young world.
- **Key Event:** No pattern. No logic. just chaos.
- **Key Event:** She checks the frequency. It's clear.
- **Key Event:** "The ionosphere," she realizes. "It's too thick. The solar radiation is bouncing everything back. My signal isn't leaving the atmosphere."
- **Key Event:** She cranks the power. The battery acid bubbles.
- **Key Event:** "Can anyone hear me?" she screams into the mic.

### Scene 3: The Isolation / The Peak

- **Key Event:** Three days pass.
- **Key Event:** She hasn't slept. She hasn't eaten. She just taps.
- **Key Event:** _Dit-dit-dah._
- **Key Event:** On the third night, the moon rises. It looks huge. Closer than she remembers.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the stars. They are different. The constellations are wrong.
- **Key Event:** The realization hits her like a physical blow.
- **Key Event:** Even if the signal got out... who would hear it?
- **Key Event:** The Zenith won't exist for five thousand years. Her brother wasn't born yet. Her friends are dust—or unborn potential.
- **Key Event:** She is sending messages to ghosts. To the future.
- **Key Event:** A profound loneliness settles over her. Heavier than gravity.
- **Key Event:** She is the only human being on Earth who knows what a radio is. She is the only one who knows math. Who knows poetry.
- **Key Event:** If she dies here, human history ends before it begins.

### Scene 4: The Acceptance / The Cliff Edge

- **Key Event:** Angelica stands up.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the transmitter. Her lifeline. Her hope.
- **Key Event:** It is a crutch. It is a plea for help that will never come.
- **Key Event:** She kicks it.
- **Key Event:** It clatters over the edge of the cliff. It falls, smashing into pieces on the rocks below.
- **Key Event:** Silence returns to the mountain.
- **Key Event:** "No," she says. Her voice is clear. Strong.
- **Key Event:** "Just me. Okay. Fine."
- **Key Event:** She wipes the dirt from her face.
- **Key Event:** "I don't need a rescue. I'll save myself."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the jungle below. The green hell.
- **Key Event:** "If you won't come for me," she tells the uncaring universe, "I'll come for you. I'll build a door, and I'll kick it down!"
- **Key Event:** She starts the climb down. She isn't a survivor anymore. She is the Architect. And she has work to do.
