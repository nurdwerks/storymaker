## Chapter 24: The Silt Broadcast

### Scene 1: The Interface

- **Key Event:** Ria rips the maintenance hatch door off its hinges. Inside is crystalline circuitry and ancient copper wiring—old world fused with Highborn modifications.

- **Key Event:** Angelica modifies Aeon's beak into a data-jack and plugs in. The hardline connection causes her eyes to roll back—she sees Code as Light and fractals.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "She's seizing."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "She is interfacing. Hold the line. They are coming."

- **Key Event:** Ria and Kaelen fight the spiders—fifty units inbound.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Spiders:** "Targets acquired."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Come and get some, you scrap-heap rejects!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Angie! Hurry up!"

### Scene 3: The Signal

- **Key Event:** Inside the virtual world, Angelica shatters the Red Ice firewall by calculating its resonant frequency.

- **Key Event:** The system demands Highborn bio-signature authorization. Angelica overwhelms it instead, feeding in her hunger, fear, rage, and love for Leo.

### Scene 4: The Broadcast

- **Key Event:** The Spire whines at a glass-shattering frequency. Spiders freeze and fall. Every screen in the Zenith goes to static, then shows Angelica's distorted, violet-burning face.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (broadcast):** "We are not your entertainment. We are the Iron Selection. We survived your poison. We survived your traps. We survived each other. We are not leaving. And you are not winning. We are changing the game."

### Scene 5: The Response

- **Key Event:** The timer hits 00:00. Angelica collapses. The shuttle doesn't take off.

- **Key Event:** A massive Extraction Claw descends from the Zenith—industrial grapple meant for heavy cargo. It grabs the entire Spire platform and rips it from the tower.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Did... did it work?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It worked. We got their attention."

- **Key Event:** They rise—not as winners, but as prisoners.
