# Chapter 6: Squad Iron

Angelica's shallow, ragged breath echoed back at her from the brushed steel walls of the Assembly Hall, a space so cavernous it felt as though it possessed its own weather system. She looked down at her hands, the grease-stained skin turning a sickly, corpse-like grey under the pallid blue light filtering from the lumin-panels suspended far above.

Around her, thousands of other candidates stood in rigid, shivering lines. The air recyclers blasted a freezing, ozone-scented draft that cut through her thin tunic, but the cold was nothing compared to the bone-deep exhaustion weighing on her limbs. Every muscle in her body ached from the Span, a dull throb that kept pace with the rhythmic, mechanical hum of the hall’s foundations.

She stood amongst the "Iron" cohort, her synthetic grey tunic—rough and ill-fitting—stamped with the molecular symbol _Fe_. Above them, on balconies of white marble bathed in artificial sunlight, the "Golds" looked down with bored amusement, their skin glowing with the health and privilege of the sky.

High above the floor, a floating platform drifted into the center of the hall. A man with a mask of cybernetic silver stood at its edge, his sensors glowing blue as he scanned the sea of potential assets below. He didn't need a microphone; the hall’s geometry was engineered to amplify his every word into a resonant, inescapable boom.

"Welcome," the Headmaster said, his voice as cold as the air. "You have ascended. You have left the Silt behind. You are now part of the Mechanism."

The floor beneath Angelica’s feet shuddered. With a heavy, industrial groan, the entire Iron section dropped a full foot. _Clang._ The impact rattled her teeth, a physical reminder that in the pyramid of the Zenith, she was the base intended to bear the weight.

It was a literal demotion. A physical manifestation of their place in the hierarchy.

"You are the shield," the Headmaster continued, looking down at them from his floating perch. "You are the wall. You are the sword. You are expendable."

He said it without malice. It was just a fact. A variable in an equation.

"Squad Iron, proceed to branding."

---

The branding was efficient. It was industrial.

There was no ceremony. Just a conveyor belt of bodies moving toward a sterile white podium in a side chamber. Ideally, a medical procedure room should be clean. This one smelled of ozone and... cooked meat.

It was the smell of a barbecue, but sickeningly sweet.

When Angelica's name was called—_Candidate 734, Ward_—there was a ripple of laughter from the line behind her.

"Look at it," someone whispered. "It's a twig. The branding laser is going to burn right through her neck."

"She won't survive the shock," another voice sneered.

Angelica ignored them. She walked to the podium, her face blank. She focused on her breathing. _Inhale for four. Hold for four. Exhale for four._

She stepped up to the line.

A Medical Drone hovered above her. It was a nightmare of chrome and plastic—a spider-like machine with too many arms and a single, red eye that cycled through focus lengths.

"State designation," the drone chirped. Its voice was cheerful, a stark contrast to the torture device attached to its manipulator arm.

"Iron," Angelica said. Her voice didn't shake.

"Compliance."

A metal clamp shot out, gripping the back of her head. It was cold and tight, immobilizing her skull against a headrest. She couldn't move. She could only stare at the wall ahead.

The laser probe extended. It hummed with a high-pitched whine that set her teeth on edge.

It touched the skin behind her right ear.

_Pain._

It wasn't a burn; it was an erasure. It felt like a hot needle was writing on her bones, vibrating through her skull. It was white-hot, blinding agony that spiked directly into her brain stem.

The smell hit her instantly. Burning skin. _Her_ skin.

Her vision blurred. Her knees buckled, but the clamp held her up.

_Don't scream,_ she ordered herself. _Screaming is data. It tells them you are weak. It tells them you are breakable._

She bit the inside of her cheek until she tasted copper. She focused on the pain, deconstructing it. _Nerve endings overload. Thermal damage to epidermis. Dermis cauterization._

It lasted three seconds. It felt like three years.

"Processing complete," the drone said, releasing her. "Next."

Angelica stepped away, swaying slightly. Her hand went instinctively to the spot. The skin was raised, tender, pulsing with a heat that radiated down her neck. She traced the lines with her shaking finger.

A barcode.

She was property now. Part of the inventory. Just another crate in the warehouse.

She walked back to the line, her eyes scanning the room through the haze of pain. She looked at her new "family."

Squad Iron. Twelve of them.

There was Ria, the giantess from the bridge, rubbing the fresh brand on her neck and scowling. She looked angry, not hurt. There was Jax, the brute, who looked like the burn only amused him. There was the 'Vampire', Subject 88, who was still twitching slightly from the shock at the door, but looking meaner for it.

They looked at her.

They didn't see a teammate. They saw a victim. They saw fresh meat.

_They're sharks,_ Angelica realized. _And I'm bleeding in the water._

Angelica lowered her hand. She didn't look away. She met their stares with a flat, dead-eyed gaze she had learned from the rats in the Silt.

_You think I'm weak,_ she thought. _Good. Underestimation is a variable I can exploit. Keep looking at the twig. You won't see the thorn._

---

Sector G-4 was a dungeon.

Located near the geothermal vents of the station's power core, down near the structural roots of the Academy, the barracks were a concrete box that smelled of sulfur, unwashed bodies, and despair. The walls sweated condensation that trickled down in slow, grey tears. The air cycler rattled constantly, sounding like a dying lung, struggling to filter the heavy, metallic air.

There were no windows. No view of the sky they had fought so hard to reach. Just harsh, flickering strip lighting that buzzed like an angry insect trapped in a jar.

Twelve metal bunk beds were bolted to the floor in two rows, facing each other across a narrow aisle that felt more like a kill-zone than a walkway. They were stripped bare of comfort—frames of cold steel with mattresses that looked more like yoga mats than bedding, thin enough that you could feel every weld seam in the frame beneath.

The room was designed for efficiency, not humanity. Every surface was hard angles and exposed metal. The walls were unpainted concrete, pockmarked with impact craters from previous occupants' frustrations. Water stains spread across the ceiling like dark continents on a decaying map, evidence of pipes that leaked somewhere in the infrastructure above. The floor was uneven, sloping slightly toward a drain in the center—a drain that reeked of chemicals and something organic that had died months ago and never quite decomposed.

There was a single window. It wasn't really a window—it was a narrow slit of reinforced poly-glass, eight inches wide and three feet tall, set high on the wall near the ceiling. Through it, you could see a slice of grey sky and the bottom edge of a ventilation tower. No stars. No nebula. Just industrial architecture and smog. It was a window designed to mock them with what they couldn't have.

"Home sweet home," Jax grunted, throwing his kit bag onto a bottom bunk near the heater vent. "I claim this one. Anyone has a problem with that, speak up."

He turned, cracking his knuckles. The sound was like a pistol shot in the small room. He looked around, daring anyone to challenge him.

No one spoke up. The hierarchy was already establishing itself. The big ate the small. The loud silenced the quiet.

It was a scramble for territory. The biggest cadets grabbed the bottom bunks, the most desirable spots because they were easier to get in and out of, and they offered a sense of ownership. Ria took the one opposite Jax. The Vampire claimed the one next to the door, his eyes darting around as if looking for an escape route.

Angelica moved quietly. She was a shadow in the corner of the room. She didn't fight for the prime spots. She went to the back, to the corner furthest from the door, near a dripping pipe.

Top bunk.

To the others, it was the worst spot. Heat rose. Ideally, it would be hotter up there. And climbing up meant vulnerability.

But to Angelica, it was high ground. It had a solid wall at her back. It gave her a clear field of view of the entire room and the single entrance. No one could sneak up on her.

She threw her bag up and climbed the ladder. The metal rungs were freezing against her palms.

The mattress was thin, barely an inch of foam over metal mesh. The pillow was a brick of compressed synthetic fiber.

She sat cross-legged on the bed, unpacking her meager belongings. A spare tunic. A toothbrush. A small tin of ration paste that she had saved from the elevator ride.

And one other thing.

She pulled a small, cracked holographic projector from her pocket. It was the size of a coin, the casing scratched and dented. She had scavenged it from the body of a dead junk-dealer in Sector 12, trading a week's worth of clean water filters for the battery to run it.

She cupped her hands around it, creating a dark space, and tapped the activation stud.

A flicker of blue light. A grainy, static-filled image hovered in her palm.

Leo.

He was smiling in the loop, a three-second capture she had taken the day before the Selection. He was holding up a piece of scrap metal he had found—a pristine copper coil—looking proud. His face was dirty, his hair a mess, but his eyes were bright.

"I found it, Angel!" he mouthed silently in the loop. "I found the good stuff!"

Angelica watched the loop three times. Her chest tightened. The silence of the image was louder than the buzzing lights.

She clicked it off.

She hid the projector under the thin pillow, tucking it deep into the fibers. It was her anchor. The only piece of soft humanity she had left in a world of hard edges.

_I'm here, Leo,_ she whispered in her mind. _I made it to the sky. I'll get the medicine. I promise._

"Hey, Runt."

The voice came from below. It was heavy, wet with amusement.

Angelica froze. She knew that voice.

She looked down over the edge of the bunk.

Ria was standing there. She was holding something in her massive hands.

A pair of boots.

Angelica's boots.

The Mag-Lock boots she had spent three months building. The ones she had scavenged parts for, rebuilt the servos on, and customized for silent running. The boots that had saved her on the bridge.

Ria was sitting on her own bunk, trying to jam her massive foot into one of them. She was stretching the leather, popping the seams. The sound of tearing fabric was excruciating.

"Nice tread," Ria sneered, looking up at her. "I accept these as rent."

"Rent?" Angelica asked, her voice quiet, barely a whisper.

"For letting you breathe my air," Ria said, shoving her heel down. "You're taking up space, Runt. Space is premium."

Jax chuckled from his bunk across the aisle. He was cleaning his fingernails with a knife. "Better thank her, Runt. Usually the rent is teeth. Or fingers. She's being generous."

Angelica looked at the boots. She saw the stress on the leather. She saw the delicate servo-mechanism in the heel being crushed under Ria's weight.

She looked at Ria. She saw the smirk. The challenge.

She ran the simulation in her head.

_Subject: Ria. Height: 6'2". Weight: 220lbs. Muscle density: High. Combat style: Brawler. Current State: Aggressive._
_Subject: Angelica. Height: 5'4". Weight: 110lbs. Combat style: None. Current State: Fatigue level 80%._

_Scenario A: Verbal Confrontation. Outcome: Escalation to violence. Probability of success: 5%._
_Scenario B: Physical Confrontation. Outcome: Severe trauma to cranial and thoracic regions. Probability of success: 0%._
_Scenario C: Compliance. Outcome: Loss of asset (boots). Retention of physical integrity._

The math was simple. Fighting now was illogical. It was suicide. The boots were valuable, but her hands were more valuable. She needed her hands to build the weapon that would defeat Ria.

Angelica stared at Ria for a long second. She forced her face to remain blank, hiding the rage that was boiling in her gut.

Then she lay back down on her bunk. She turned her back to the edge.

"Enjoy the fit," she said softly.

Ria laughed. It was a cruel, barking sound. "Mute and weak. You won't last a week, twigs. Enjoy the barefoot life."

She tossed the other boot onto her own bed and walked away toward the latrine, strutting like she owned the room.

Angelica stared at the ceiling. She listened to the hum of the lights. She listened to the sound of her own heartbeat, slow and steady.

_Variable added: Theft._
_Response required: Asymmetric._
_Timeframe: Immediate._

---

The barracks went dark at 2200 hours. The main lights died with a thudding clank, leaving only the dim, red emergency stips running along the floor.

The snoring started almost immediately. It was a cacophony of snorts, grunts, and wheezes—the sound of twelve exhausted bodies collapsing into unconsciousness.

Angelica lay awake. She waited.

She stared at the red glow of the emergency strip reflected on the metal mesh of the bunk above her. She slowed her breathing, matching it to the rhythm of the air cycler.

_Inhale. Rattle. Exhale. Rattle._

She checked her internal clock. _2300 hours._ Too early. The REM cycle hadn't set in yet.

_0100 hours._ Still shifting. Jax was tossing and turning. The Vampire was mumbling in his sleep.

_0200 hours._

Deep sleep. The room was heavy with it. The snoring had settled into a steady, rhythmic drone.

She moved.

She didn't make a sound. She slid down the ladder of her bunk like a ghost, her muscles controlling the descent so perfectly that the metal didn't even creak. Her bare feet touched the cold concrete floor. It was freezing, sucking the heat straight out of her soles, but she registered the cold only as data.

She went to her kit bag. She unzipped it slowly, millimeter by millimeter. She took out her spare tunic. She found the seam she had identified earlier—the one running along the collar where the heating element was thickest.

She used her teeth to rip the thread. She pulled out the wire. It was a thin filament of copper, coated in a polymer sheath.

_Length: 36 inches. Conductivity: High. Tensile strength: Low._

It wasn't a weapon. It was a component.

She moved to Ria's bunk.

The giantess was asleep on the bottom bunk, sprawled out on her back, her mouth open. She sounded like a combustion engine idling. The stolen boots were sitting on the floor by her head, gleaming in the red light like trophies.

Angelica stared at them. She could take them now. She could just pick them up and walk away.

_No,_ she thought. _Theft is petty. Theft implies weakness. I need to make a statement. I need to change the equation._

She looked up at the light fixture above Ria's bed. It was a heavy industrial unit, caged in wire mesh, bolted to the concrete pillar next to the bunk frame.

She climbed up the side of the bunk frame, silent as a spider. Her toes gripped the metal angle-iron. She reached up.

She didn't have a screwdriver. But she had fingers that had spent ten years picking locks in the Silt. She found the release catch on the wire cage. _Click._ It swung open.

Inside was the ballast and the capacitor. The capacitor was a cylinder the size of a thumb, wrapped in blue plastic. It held the charge for the starter capacitor. _220 volts. 50 amps peak discharge._

It was enough to kill a rat. It was enough to stop a heart if it hit the wrong rhythm. For a human of Ria's mass? It would be a sledgehammer to the nervous system.

Angelica worked quickly. She stripped the ends of the copper filament using her fingernails. She wrapped one end around the capacitor's positive terminal, twisting it tight to ensure a clean connection.

She ran the wire down the back of the bunk post, hiding it in the shadow of the metal leg. It was invisible in the dim light.

She reached the bottom. She found the metal frame of the bunk ladder—the exact spot where the paint was worn away. The spot where Ria would instinctively grab to pull herself out of bed.

She wrapped the other end of the wire around the bare metal.

It was a simple circuit. Ground to frame.

When the light switch was off, the circuit was open. The capacitor was dormant. Safe.

But at 0600 hours, when the reveille signal was sent... the main breaker would trip. The lights would surge on. The capacitor would fill. And if someone was touching the frame... it would dump the entire load into the path of least resistance.

Angelica finished the wiring. She checked the connections. Solid.

She replaced the light casing. She climbed back down.

She stood over Ria for a moment. She watched the rise and fall of her chest.

_You wanted rent,_ she thought. _I'm paying in electricity._

She went back to her own bunk. Her heart was hammering now, the adrenaline finally catching up with her. Her hands were shaking slightly—not from fear, but from the intensity of focus required to work silently in the dark with lives hanging in the balance.

She had just weaponized a light fixture. She had turned a piece of safety equipment into a trap designed to electrocute a human being. The realization settled over her like a cold blanket.

_This is who I am now,_ she thought, staring at her hands in the dim red light. _Not the girl who fixed broken drones. Not the girl who built water filters for sick children. I'm the girl who rigs traps._

She waited for guilt to arrive. For regret. For the soft, human emotions that should accompany crossing that line.

They didn't come.

Instead, there was only cold satisfaction. The equation had been balanced. Ria had stolen. Angelica had punished. Justice, delivered through applied physics.

She climbed up to her bunk and lay down, tucking her arms behind her head. She stared at the rust stains on the ceiling, mapping their patterns like constellations. Her mind was clear. Calm. The panic and fear that had gripped her earlier—when she'd watched Ria destroy her boots—had been transformed into something else. Something harder.

_Variable processed: Theft. Response executed: Asymmetric retaliation. Outcome pending._

_Sleep,_ she ordered herself. _Recharge. Tomorrow is a combat day. And every day after that._

---

At 0600 hours, the world ended.

The reveille klaxon blasted through the room, a deafening, discordant siren designed to induce immediate adrenaline response. It was loud enough to vibrate the teeth in Angelica's skull.

The main lights snapped on with a blinding white flash.

"Up! Up! Up!" a voice screamed over the intercom. "Movement! I want movement!"

The squad jumped out of bed, fueled by panic and training.

Ria, groggy and aggressive, sat up. She rubbed her eyes with one massive hand. She swung her legs out over the side of the bed.

Angelica watched from above. She held her breath.

Ria reached up. Her hand closed around the metal ladder of her bunk.

_Contact._

_Click._

The circuit completed.

_ZAP._

It wasn't a spark. It was a lightning bolt. A blue arc of electricity snapped through the room, lighting up the shadows with a strobe-like intensity.

Ria screamed.

It wasn't a normal scream. It was a guttural, choked noise—_HRK-KKKK!_—as 220 volts slammed into her nervous system. Her muscles locked instantly. Every tendon in her body snapped tight.

She convulsed, her back arching off the mattress, her body stiffening into a rigid plank. The current threw her backward. She flew off the bed, crashing into the metal lockers opposite with a deafening _CLANG_ that dented the steel door.

She hit the floor and lay there, twitching violently. Smoke rose from her palm where the skin had fused to the metal ladder before ripping free. Her eyes were rolled back in her head, showing only the whites.

The smell of ozone and burnt hair filled the room instantly, masking the smell of sulfur.

The room went silent. Even the klaxon seemed to fade away into the background.

Ten pairs of eyes stared at Ria. They were wide with shock. The Vampire was pressed against the wall, his hands up as if fending off an attack. Jax had his knife out, looking around for an enemy he couldn't see.

Slowly, tentatively, they looked at the bunk above the scorch mark.

Angelica sat up. She stretched her arms over her head. She yawned, a long, theatrical yawn that showed her teeth.

She climbed down the ladder. She moved slowly, deliberately. She walked across the room, her bare feet padding softly on the concrete.

She stepped over Ria's paralyzed legs. The giantess was still twitching, her nerves firing randomly, unable to process commands.

Angelica picked up her boots.

She sat down on the edge of Ria's bunk—right next to the smoking wire, but careful not to touch it. She put the boots on. She laced them up slowly, methodically. Left boot. Right boot. She tied the knots with precision.

She stood up. She stomped her heel, engaging the Mag-Lock. _Clack._

"The rent was too high," Angelica said. Her voice was calm, conversational. It cut through the silence like a scalpel. "I'm moving out."

Ria wheezed. She tried to lift her head, but her neck muscles wouldn't cooperate. She managed to roll her eyes toward Angelica. Her hands were curled into claws, the fingers blackened.

"Okay..." she rasped. Her voice was a broken croak. "You... have... teeth..."

She coughed, a spasm that shook her whole body.

"I like... teeth."

Angelica looked down at her. She didn't smile. She didn't frown. She just looked.

"You assume I'm prey because I'm quiet," she said. "A landmine is quiet until you step on it."

She leaned closer, her face inches from Ria's.

"Do not step on me again."

She turned and walked toward the door, leaving Squad Iron staring at her back. But as she reached the threshold, she paused. She turned, just slightly, enough to catch their eyes one more time.

The room had changed. The hierarchy had inverted in a single electric moment. Jax, the alpha male, was standing against the wall, his knife still half-drawn but forgotten. The Vampire was pressed into the corner, his yellow eyes wide with a new kind of respect. The others—whose names she hadn't bothered to learn yet—were frozen, watching her like she was a bomb that might go off.

And Ria. Ria was on the floor, still twitching, her massive frame reduced to a convulsing mass of misfiring nerves. The giant had fallen. The predator had become prey.

Angelica didn't smile. Smiling would imply emotion. This wasn't personal. This was mathematics.

_Variable X: Established dominance through asymmetric response._  
_Variable Y: Demonstrated technical capability._  
_Variable Z: Redefined threat perception._

_Outcome: Survival probability increased from 12% to... calculating..._

She let her eyes sweep the room one more time, meeting each gaze, logging each micro-expression. Fear. Uncertainty. Calculation. Good. They were learning.

"Training starts in twenty minutes," she said, her voice carrying the weight of someone who had just rewritten the rules. "I suggest you all find boots that fit."

She walked out into the corridor, the door hissing shut behind her with a pneumatic sigh.

---

The communal washroom for Sector G-4 was located down the corridor, a fluorescent-lit nightmare of stainless steel and rust. It smelled of industrial disinfectant and something organic that had gone bad in the drains.

Angelica walked in, her new boots clicking sharply on the tiled floor. The sound was satisfying. Solid. Weighted.

She went to one of the sinks. The mirror above it was polished steel, not glass—glass could be broken into shanks. The steel was scratched and dented, distorting her reflection like a funhouse mirror.

She looked at herself.

Her face was pale, smudged with grease from the light fixture. Her hair was a tangled mess of black wire. But it was the brand that drew her eye.

_FE-734._

It was red and angry against her skin. A mark of ownership.

She turned on the tap. The water came out sputtering and brown before clearing to a freezing grey stream. She cupped her hands and splashed her face. The cold was a shock, but it woke her up fully. It washed away the last of the sleep and the fear.

She scrubbed her skin until it was raw, trying to get the feeling of the Silt off her.

The door hissed open behind her.

Angelica didn't turn. She watched the reflection in the steel.

It was the Vampire. Subject 88.

He stood in the doorway, looking unsure. He was rubbing his chest where the blast door shock had hit him the day before. Up close, he looked younger than he had in the Assembly Hall. The sharpened teeth made him look fierce, but his eyes were wide and nervous.

He walked over to the sink next to hers. He didn't look at her. He turned on the water and started washing his hands, scrubbing them with a manic intensity.

"That was..." he started, then stopped. He cleared his throat. "That was 220 volts. I saw the capacitor."

Angelica dried her face with the rough paper towel from the dispenser. "Standard industrial starter capacitor. 50 amp discharge."

"It could have killed her," the Vampire said. He looked at her then, his yellow eyes evaluating. "If she'd been wet? Or if she'd grabbed with both hands? Cardiac arrest. Boom."

"She wasn't wet," Angelica said calmly. "And she grabs with her right hand. Muscle memory. I watched her climb up yesterday."

The Vampire blinked. "You watched her?"

"I watch everything," Angelica said. "Data is survival."

He let that sink in. He stopped scrubbing his hands.

"I'm Silas," he said. He didn't offer a hand—handshakes were dangerous in the Iron barracks—but he nodded. "From the Scrapyards in Sector 9."

"Angelica. Sector 12."

"The Silt?" Silas raised an eyebrow. "I heard stories. They say even the rats have knives down there."

"The rats are the nice ones," Angelica said.

Silas laughed. It was a nervous, skittering sound. "Yeah. I bet."

He looked back at the door. "Ria is going to kill you, you know. When she wakes up. When her nerves reset."

"She'll try," Angelica corrected. "But she's big. Heavy. Loud. I'll hear her coming."

"You can't trap the whole academy, Angel."

"I don't need to trap the whole academy," she said, tossing the paper towel into the recycler. "Just the parts that try to step on me."

She turned to leave.

"Hey," Silas called out.

She stopped.

"The wiring," he said. "The bypass you did on the light fixture. That was... clean. I know tech. That was good work."

Angelica looked at him. For the first time, she saw something other than a threat. She saw a potential asset. A fellow engineer.

"I know," she said.

She walked out, leaving him alone in the echo of the dripping taps.

---

High above the sweating concrete of Sector G-4, in the rarefied air of the Zenith, Lord Cromwell sat in his office.

It was not a sterile room like the Headmaster's Assembly Hall. It was a library.

The walls were lined with books—real books, made of paper and ink, bound in leather that smelled of age and animal skin. There were thousands of them, a collection that would be worth more than the entire gross domestic product of the Silt. There were artifacts, too. A pre-Collapse pistol. A fragment of a stained-glass window. A skull of a wolf, an animal that had been extinct for two centuries.

Cromwell sat at a desk made of mahogany, another extinct material. He was an old man, his skin like parchment paper stretched over sharp, aquiline features. He did not wear the cybernetic enhancements that were fashionable among the Zenith elite. He wore his age like a badge of honor. In a world of eternal youth and chrome, being old was the ultimate flex. It meant you were powerful enough to embrace decay.

A holographic display hovered above his desk, projecting a grainy, black-and-white feed.

It was the security footage from Barracks G-4.

Cromwell watched it with the intensity of a jeweler studying a diamond for flaws.

He watched the spark. The blue arc of electricity illuminating the dark room.

He watched Ria fly backward, her body rigid.

He watched the silence that followed.

And then, he watched the girl. Angelica Ward. Candidate 734.

He watched her sit up. He watched her yawn. He watched her walk across the room, stepping over the twitching body of her enemy with the casual indifference of someone stepping over a puddle.

He watched her put on the boots.

"Pause," Cromwell said. His voice was dry, cracking like old leaves.

The image froze. Angelica was mid-lace, her head bowed, her hands steady.

"Analysis," he commanded.

A soft, feminine voice—his AI, Mnemosyne—spoke from the hidden speakers. "Subject: Ward, Angelica. Age: 17. Origin: Sector 12, Silt. Psych Profile: Deviant. Intelligence: Top 1 percentile. Empathy: Suppressed."

"Suppressed," Cromwell repeated, testing the word. "Not absent. Suppressed."

"Correct, my Lord. Her physiological markers indicate high stress levels—cortisol and adrenaline were spiked during the theft. But her behavioral output remained flat. She feels fear, but she compartmentalizes it immediately."

Cromwell leaned forward, tapping a finger on the mahogany desk. "She feels fear. Good. Fear is a motivator. A fearless soldier is a dead soldier. I don't want berserkers. I want calculators."

He waved his hand, and the feed resumed.

He listened to her voice. _ "A landmine is quiet until you step on it."_

He smiled. It was a rare expression, one that crinkled the corners of his eyes but didn't quite reach his mouth.

"A landmine," he whispered. "Yes. That is exactly what she is. Small. Buried. Violent only when triggered."

He stood up and walked to the window. The view was breathtaking. The Academy spires pierced the clouds, gleaming in the morning sun. Far below, lost in the smog, was the Silt.

"Vane wants tanks," Cromwell said to the empty room. "He wants hammers to smash the Rebellion. He looks at Ria and sees a soldier. He looks at Jax and sees a warrior."

"Headmaster Vane's selection algorithms prioritize physical durability and aggression," Mnemosyne noted.

"Vane is a fool," Cromwell scoffed. "He thinks war is about hitting harder. He has forgotten that the most dangerous weapon in history wasn't a bomb. It was a spy. It was a saboteur. It was a virus."

He turned back to the screen. Angelica was walking out of the barracks, leaving a room full of terrified giants in her wake.

"This girl... she isn't a hammer. She's a scalpel. She sees the systems. She saw the social hierarchy of that room, analyzed the power dynamics, and dismantled the alpha predator without throwing a punch. She used the environment against her enemy."

He walked back to the desk and picked up a fountain pen. He opened a leather-bound ledger.

"Mnemosyne, flag her file."

"Flagging for disciplinary review?"

"No," Cromwell snapped. "Do not let the Wardens touch her. If they try to punish her for this, intervene. Override their protocols."

"Understood. What classification shall I assign?"

Cromwell wrote a single name in the ledger, his handwriting precise and archaic.

_Angelica Ward._

Next to it, he wrote a code. _Project: VELVET._

"Status: Asset," Cromwell said softly, watching the data stream populate next to her profile. "Potential recruit for the Shadow Directorate. Keep her in Iron. Let the pressure cook her. Let's see if she cracks... or if she turns into a diamond."

"The Shadow Directorate is currently at capacity, my Lord," Mnemosyne reminded him. "Funding is... restricted. The Council favors the heavy infantry program."

"The Council favors noise," Cromwell snapped, standing up. He walked to the window, his reflection ghostly in the glass against the backdrop of the sprawling Academy. "They want parades. They want giants in power armor marching down the boulevards of the Celestial City to make the citizens feel safe. They have forgotten that safety is an illusion."

He looked down at the tiny specks of the candidates moving in the courtyard far below.

"Real power isn't loud," he whispered. "Real power is the whisper that starts a riot. It's the knife in the dark that ends a dynasty. Vane is building an army to fight a war he doesn't understand. I am building the scalpel that will end it before it begins."

He turned back to the desk, his eyes alight with a cold, terrifying purpose.

"Project: VELVET is priority one. Redirect resources from the heavy weapons budget. Hide the transfer in the sewage maintenance logs. No one looks at sewage."

"Done," Mnemosyne said. "And if Subject Ward fails? If the pressure breaks her?"

Cromwell looked at the frozen image of Angelica's eyes—cold, hard, and terrifyingly intelligent.

"Then she was just another piece of slag," he murmured. "And we will sweep her away with the rest of the dust. But if she survives... if she keeps those boots..."

He smiled, a predators smile.

"Then she will change the world. Or burn it down. Either way, it will be spectacular to watch."

"The girl is a tripwire," he murmured, closing the book with a heavy thud. "And I have so many traps I need to set."

# End of Chapter 6
