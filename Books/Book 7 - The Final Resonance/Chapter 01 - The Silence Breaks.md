## Chapter 01: The Silence Breaks

### Scene 1: The Deep Eye Sensor Array

- **Key Event:** Lisbet is monitoring the long-range scanners during a graveyard shift. She observes the star-field data simply vanish from the screens—not obscured, but deleted.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She instinctively checks the hardware first, assuming a glitch, before realizing the code is perfectly functional. Her denial shifts to cold logic.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Sensors aren't offline. They're just... seeing nothing. The stars are gone."

- **Key Event:** She attempts to reboot the array, but the "Silence" spreads across multiple frequencies.

### Scene 2: The High Council Chamber

- **Key Event:** Vane dismisses the sensor report as a calibration error caused by the ship's aging systems.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He visibly hides a tremor in his hand. His dismissal is too quick, too loud. He knows what it is.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "The Aeterna is old. Ghosts in the machine, Lisbet. Nothing more."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen challenges Vane, noting that the "glitch" coincides with a drop in ambient Resonance levels.

### Scene 3: The Greenhouse

- **Key Event:** Angelica is pruning a withered plant. She feels a sudden, chilling draft that has no physical source. It is the psychic pressure of the Entity arriving.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She doesn't panic. She simply puts down her shears and accepts the inevitable.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "It's here. The bill has come due."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Then we pay it. Or we fight it."
