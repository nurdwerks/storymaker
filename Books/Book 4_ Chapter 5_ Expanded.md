### Chapter 5: The First Turn

#### Scene 1: The Corpse

The first encounter didn't happen inside the lab. It happened on the monitors.

Angelica was watching the external security feed, trying to gauge a path to the next sector. The camera showed the alleyway outside the module. It was littered with debris and bodies—a graveyard of the fall. The silence of the image was unnerving, a stillness that felt heavy and expectant. The wind howled through the broken skyscrapers, kicking up dust that swirled like ghosts.

One body in particular caught her eye. It was the "Noble" from the crash site—Lord Vermillion. He lay where they had left him, frozen in the mud, minus his boots. He looked like a discarded doll, his velvet coat stiff with frost, his bare feet blue and shriveled. He was a monument to the failure of the old world's hierarchy.

"He's dead," Zephyr said, looking over her shoulder, his voice tight. "Frozen stiff. Serves him right. Pride goeth before the frostbite."

"Wait," Angelica said, leaning closer to the screen. "Look at the thermal."

She switched the view to infrared. The landscape turned blue and grey, the cold dominating everything. But the body...

The body was glowing. Not the faint residual heat of a cooling corpse, but a bright, burning red. A fever spike. It was hotter than a living human should be. It was burning up from the inside, a reactor going critical.

"He's still alive?" Zephyr asked, horrified.

"No," Aris said, glancing at the screen. "He's incubating."

#### Scene 2: The Twitch

As they watched, the body moved. It wasn't a conscious movement. It was a spasm, a violent contraction that looked like he had been hit with a taser. The back arched violently, cracking the frozen mud around him.

Then, the broken leg—the one twisted at a ninety-degree angle—snapped. *Crack.*

Through the grainy audio pickup, they heard the bone grinding. The leg twisted back into place. It wasn't healed; it was forced. The muscles contracted so hard they pulled the shattered bone straight, ignoring the jagged edges tearing through the flesh. The sound was nauseating, wet and crunchy.

"That's impossible," Kaelen whispered, stepping back. "He's dead. I saw his eyes freeze. No one survives that."

"The virus reactivates the nervous system," Aris said from his desk, not looking up. "It jump-starts the engine. But there's no driver. It is purely mechanical. It repairs structural damage by sacrificing long-term viability. It burns the candle at both ends."

The body stood up. It moved jerkily, like a marionette with tangled strings. It swayed, then locked its knees with a mechanical click.

#### Scene 3: The Eyes

Vermillion turned slowly towards the security camera, as if he could sense them watching through the lens.

The face was a ruin. The frostbite had turned his nose and ears black. His skin was grey, pulled tight over his skull. But his eyes...

His eyes were gone. In their place were two pools of absolute void. No white, no iris. Just a wet, glossy blackness that seemed to absorb the dim light. His jaw hung open, slack, drooling a thick black ichor that steamed in the cold air. It wasn't blood; it was the overflow of the virus.

He didn't look like a man anymore. He looked like a sketch of a man drawn by a madman. He looked like a hollow thing filled with hate.

"Void Eyes," Angelica murmured. "Aris, what happens if they see us?"

"They don't see," Aris corrected. "They sense. Pheromones. Heat. Resonance. They are hunting dogs."

#### Scene 4: The Bite

A refugee, a young woman carrying a bundle of scavenged clothes, walked into the frame. She was shivering, eyes on the ground, looking for anything useful. She didn't see the monster at first. She saw a man in noble's clothes standing up.

"Sir?" she called out, her voice trembling. "Are you okay? Do you have food? I have... I have a coat I can trade."

Vermillion didn't answer. He didn't breathe. He just vibrated with tension, his head cocking to the side like a bird listening for a worm.

The refugee stepped closer, concern overriding her caution. "Sir?"

The attack was a blur. Vermillion didn't stumble. He launched himself. He covered the ten feet between them in a second, moving with a speed that defied physics. He tackled the woman, pinning her to the ground with inhuman strength.

It wasn't a fight. It was feeding.

He buried his face in her neck. Blood sprayed, black in the low light. The woman screamed, but the sound was cut short as he tore her throat out.

Angelica recoiled from the screen, covering her mouth. Zephyr looked away. Even Ria looked disturbed, her hand tightening on her shotgun.

"He's eating her," Zephyr choked out. "He's actually eating her."

"Fuel," Aris corrected. "High-calorie intake required for the metabolic surge. The virus burns energy at 500% the normal rate. They have to eat constantly. If they don't eat, they digest their own organs."

On the screen, Vermillion lifted his head. His mouth was smeared with gore. He looked directly at the camera again. And then, he shrieked. It was a sound that made the speakers crackle—a high-pitched, oscillating wail that sounded like metal tearing.

"He's calling the others," Aris said, finally standing up and wiping his hands. "Pack your bags. We have company."

Angelica stared at the screen. The woman on the ground twitched. Her eyes rolled back. They turned black. The transformation was faster this time. The virus was adapting.

"Death is just a pause," Angelica whispered, her hand going to her own pulse. "Just a pause before the hunger starts."

The woman stood up, wiping the blood from her mouth. She looked at the camera and screamed, a sound that merged with Vermillion's call, a duet of the damned echoing in the dead city. The noise was a signal, a dinner bell for the darkness that was waking up all around them. The group stood in silence, listening to the chorus of hunger rising from the dark.
