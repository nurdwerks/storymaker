## Chapter 6: Squad Iron

### Scene 1: The Sorting

- **Key Event:** The Assembly Hall.
- **Detailed Description:** The cadets are herded into the Grand Assembly Hall. It is a cavernous space of brushed steel and polished duracrete, designed to make humans feel small. The air is recycled and cold, smelling of ozone and disinfectant. Thousands of teenagers stand in formation, separated by the colors of their tunics. High above, on a floating platform, stands the Headmaster. His face is a mask of cybernetic silver, expressionless and cold. He speaks without a microphone, his voice amplified by the acoustics of the room.

- **Key Event:** The announcement.
- **Detailed Description:** The Headmaster announces the stratification system of the Academy, which mirrors the society of the Zenith.
  1.  **Gold:** Leadership and Command. They stand on the upper tiers, bathed in warm light.
  2.  **Silver:** Science and Innovation. They occupy the middle tiers, holding tablets and tools.
  3.  **Bronze:** Engineering and Construction. They stand near the machinery.
  4.  **Iron:** Protection and Infantry.
- **Key Event:** The designation.
- **Detailed Description:** "Iron," the Headmaster says, "is the foundation. It bears the weight. It is buried in the dark so the Gold may shine." The floor beneath the lowest group—Angelica's group—drops a foot, physically lowering them. Squad Iron is designated. They are the grunts, the fodder, the shield.

### Scene 2: The Branding

- **Key Event:** The procession.
- **Detailed Description:** One by one, the Iron cadets are called to the podium. When Angelica's name is called, there is a ripple of laughter. She is small, malnourished from her life in the Silt, and looks out of place among the hulking laborers and street fighters. She walks with a neutral expression, ignoring the jeers.

- **Key Event:** The mark.
- **Detailed Description:** She reaches the podium. A medical drone descends from the ceiling. It does not ask for permission. A laser probe extends and burns a barcode into the skin behind her right ear. The pain is sharp and hot, smelling of singed flesh. It is permanent. It marks her status as property of the Academy.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She does not flinch. She touches the tender brand, feeling the raised skin. She recognizes her official status: "Expendable." She files this away as data, not an insult.

- **Key Event:** The survey.
- **Detailed Description:** She returns to her line and surveys her new "family." Squad Iron consists of twelve cadets. There is Ria, a giantess with muscles like hydraulic pistons. There is Jax, a scowling boy with scars on his knuckles. They look at her like fresh meat. They see a victim.

### Scene 3: The Bunk

- **Key Event:** Sector G-4.
- **Detailed Description:** Squad Iron is marched to their barracks in Sector G-4. It is essentially a dungeon. Located near the geothermal vents of the station's power core, the walls are bare concrete that sweat condensation. The air cycler rattles constantly, struggling to filter the sulfurous smell of the vents. The room is cramped, filled with twelve metal bunk beds bolted to the floor. There are no windows, only harsh strip lighting that hums.

- **Key Event:** The claim.
- **Detailed Description:** It is a scramble for territory. The biggest cadets grab the bottom bunks. Angelica, moving quietly, claims a top corner bunk in the back. It is the most defensible position—high ground, wall at her back, clear view of the door.

- **Key Event:** The holo.
- **Detailed Description:** She unpacks her meager belongings. A spare tunic. A toothbrush. And a small, cracked holographic projector. She hides it under her thin pillow. It contains a static-filled image of Leo, her brother. It is her only piece of soft humanity in a world of hard edges.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She feels the weight of losing freedom. In the Undercity, she was hungry, but she was free. Here, she is a barcode. She is inventory. She touches the pillow, ensuring the holo is safe.

### Scene 4: The Theft

- **Key Event:** The confrontation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica goes to the communal latrine. When she returns, she finds Ria sitting on her bunk. Ria is holding Angelica's Mag-Lock Boots. These aren't standard issue; Angelica spent three months scavenging parts and rebuilding them to be silent and magnetized. Ria tries to force her massive feet into them, stretching the leather.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Nice tread. I accept these as rent. For letting you breathe my air."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Jax:** "Better thank her, Runt. Usually the rent is teeth. Or fingers."

- **Key Event:** The calculation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands in the aisle. She looks at Ria. She runs the combat simulation in her head: Ria is 6'2", 220lbs, with a 74-inch reach. Angelica is 5'4", 110lbs. Probability of kinetic victory in a direct confrontation: 0%. Probability of severe injury: 100%. Angelica says nothing. She turns around and climbs into her bunk, leaving the boots.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Mute and weak. You won't last a week, twigs. Enjoy the barefoot life."

### Scene 5: The Trap

- **Key Event:** The preparation.
- **Detailed Description:** The barracks go dark at lights out. The sound of snoring fills the room. At 0200 hours, Angelica moves. She acts with surgical precision. She silently unscrews the casing of the overhead light fixture near Ria's bunk. She strips a length of copper filament from her spare tunic's heating element. She wires the light fixture's capacitor—which holds a charge of 220 volts—directly to the metal frame of Ria's bunk ladder. It is a simple, brutal circuit.

- **Key Event:** The execution.
- **Detailed Description:** At 0600, the reveille klaxon blasts. The squad jumps out of bed. Ria, groggy and aggressive, grabs the metal ladder to climb down. The circuit completes. A blue arc of electricity snaps through the room. Ria convulses as 220 volts lock her muscles. She is thrown backward, crashing into the metal lockers with a deafening clang. She lies on the floor, twitching, her feet numb and useless.

- **Key Event:** The reclamation.
- **Detailed Description:** The room is silent. Eleven pairs of eyes stare at the small girl in the top bunk. Angelica climbs down. She steps over Ria's paralyzed legs. She calmly unlaces her boots from Ria's feet and puts them on. She ties them tight.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The rent was too high. I'm moving out."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (wheezing):** "Okay... You have teeth. I like teeth."

- **Character Defining Moment:** **Angelica Ward** — She establishes herself dangerously.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You assume I'm prey because I'm quiet. A landmine is quiet until you step on it. Do not step on me again."
