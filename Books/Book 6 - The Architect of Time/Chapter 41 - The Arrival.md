## Chapter 41: The Arrival

### Scene 1: The Wake / Cryo-Deck, The Aeterna

- **Key Event:** The computer jolts Angelica out of stasis. It is not a gentle waking; it is a violent chemical resurrection.
- **Key Event:** _System:_ **"DESTINATION REACHED. CHRONO-SYNC STABILIZED."**
- **Key Event:** Angelica spasms in the gel-filled pod. Her lungs burn as they try to remember how to process oxygen. She claws at the glass, her fingernails scraping against the frost.
- **Key Event:** The seal hisses, depressurizing. The hatch pops open, spilling gallons of viscous blue stasis fluid onto the deck plating.
- **Key Event:** Angelica falls out with the fluid, hitting the cold metal floor on her hands and knees. She retches, coughing up lungs full of the chemical goop. It tastes like copper and antifreeze.
- **Key Event:** She shivers violently. It isn't just the cold; it's the _re-entry shock_. Her mind feels too big for her skull, still vibrating from the transit through the wormhole.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She doesn't know _when_ she is. She remembers the launch. She remembers the promise she made to Torin. But the cryo-sleep steals time. It steals memory. For a terrifying second, she forgets if she succeeded or if she is trapped in the void forever.
- **Key Event:** She wipes the slime from her eyes. She sees her hands. They are scarred. Weathered. The hands of a woman who built a starship from scrap metal in a jungle. They are not the hands of the girl who left the Zenith.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She forces herself to stand despite the vertigo, driven by a singular, overriding mission. The pain is just data.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** _(Hoarse)_ "Status. ... Report."

### Scene 2: The Date / The Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica stumbles onto the bridge. It is silent, save for the hum of the reactor core—the _Aeterna_'s heart, beating with the power of a captured singularity.
- **Key Event:** She grips the command console to steady herself. "Computer. Time elapsed since departure."
- **Key Event:** _Computer:_ **"SHIPBOARD TIME: 20 YEARS, 4 MONTHS, 12 DAYS."**
- **Key Event:** Angelica nods. She felt every year of it in the construction, even if the sleep took the journey.
- **Key Event:** "Computer. Local time relative to target coordinates."
- **Key Event:** _Computer:_ **"TARGET TIME: 2500 AD. ELAPSED TIME AT TARGET: 5 MINUTES, 32 SECONDS."**
- **Key Event:** Angelica freezes. The silence on the bridge seems to deepen.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** Five minutes. She spent two decades bleeding, building, aging, and mourning. She lived an entire life in the past. She buried Torin. She raised a civilization. And here... the tea she left on the console wouldn't even be cold yet.
- **Key Event:** A bitter, hysterical laugh bubbles up in her chest. The universe is a cruel joke.
- **Key Event:** She looks at her reflection in the dark glass of the viewscreen. A white streak runs through her hair now. Her eyes are harder, lined with crows' feet from squinting at a prehistoric sun.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Five minutes. ... I was gone for five minutes."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Torin... you missed it by five minutes."

### Scene 3: The View / The Bridge

- **Key Event:** "Open blast shutters," she commands. Her voice is stronger now. The Command Voice.
- **Key Event:** The heavy titanium shutters retract with a groan of metal.
- **Key Event:** The view hits her like a physical blow.
- **Key Event:** Earth hangs below them, a swirling marble of blue and white. But above it... fire.
- **Key Event:** The _Zenith_ is there. It is burning. The Hunter fleet surrounds it like a swarm of wasps attacking a wounded whale.
- **Key Event:** Laser batteries flash in the silence of space. Debris fields glitter like diamond dust. It is exactly as she left it.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** It is surreal. She feels like a ghost haunting her own life. To them, she just vanished into the wormhole. To them, the desperation is fresh. To her, this war is ancient history. It is a cold case she has spent twenty years solving.
- **Key Event:** She sees the enemy flagship—the _Devourer_. It hasn't moved an inch tactical-wise. Its shields are still cycling on the same frequency she memorized a lifetime ago.
- **Key Event:** "They haven't even reloaded," she whispers.

### Scene 4: The Timing / The Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica sits in the Captain's Chair. It fits her differently now. She doesn't perch on the edge like an imposter. She settles into it. she owns it.
- **Key Event:** Her fingers fly across the tactical console. She is faster than before. More precise. She isn't guessing; she _knows_. She built this technology. She wrote the code these ships use.
- **Key Event:** She brings the _Aeterna_'s weapons systems online. The reactor growls, hungry.
- **Key Event:** "Hail the _Zenith_," she orders. "Wideband. I want everyone to hear this."
- **Key Event:** She opens the channel. She imagines Ironwood's face. Ria's confusion. Kaelen's relief.
- **Key Event:** She checks the chronometer. 5 minutes, 45 seconds.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She isn't the victim anymore. She isn't the prey running from the dark. She is the Architect. And she has brought the fire.
- **Key Event:** She pushes the throttle forward. The ship surges, the G-force pressing her back.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She shifts from a survivor to an aggressor, ready for violence. She is no longer fighting for survival; she is fighting for extermination.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Right on time. ... Target the flagship. Ramming speed."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Sorry I'm late. Traffic was murder."
