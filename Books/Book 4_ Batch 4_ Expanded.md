### Chapter 16: Aris's Experiment

#### Scene 1: The Specimen

The survivors had settled into a temporary rhythm in the maintenance sector. It was a rhythm of fear and silence, broken only by the hum of the heater and the occasional click of Aris's datapad. The air was thick with the smell of ozone and unwashed bodies.

Dr. Aris wasn't sleeping. He wasn't resting. He was working. While the others huddled for warmth, he was preparing a laboratory.

He had found a small ventilation shaft that led directly to a known Blighted nest. He had set a trap. A heating coil, salvaged from a broken drone, placed inside a reinforced cage made of rebar and mesh. He wired it to a motion sensor.

"What are you doing?" Ria asked, watching him with suspicion. She was oiling her joints, the smell of grease heavy in the air. "You're playing with fire."

"Fishing," Aris said simply. "We need to understand the predator."

He activated the coil. It glowed a dull red, a beacon in the infrared spectrum.

A moment later, something crawled out of the vent. It was small, a Blighted that had been a child. It sniffed the air, drawn by the heat. It hissed, its black eyes fixing on the coil. It crawled into the cage, driven by a hunger that overrode caution.

Aris slammed the door shut with a remote trigger.

The creature shrieked, throwing itself against the bars. But the cage held.

"Subject 202," Aris said, recording the capture on his datapad. "Fascinating. The ocular receptors are completely atrophied. It navigates entirely by thermal sensors in the nasal cavity. It smells heat."

#### Scene 2: The Test

Aris wheeled the cage into the center of the room. The creature inside was thrashing, biting the metal bars with teeth that were too sharp and too long. Saliva dripped from its jaws, sizzling on the floor.

"This is dangerous," Kaelen said, his hand on his sword. "Kill it. It's an abomination."

"Not yet," Aris said. "We need data. We know they are strong. We know they are fast. We need to know how to stop them. We need to know their limits."

He wasn't trying to cure it. He was testing the **Pathogen**. He wanted to know the kill-switch.

He pulled a canister from his pack. "Standard Zenith riot gas. Neurotoxin. Designed to incapacitate a crowd in seconds."

He sprayed the gas into the cage. The white cloud filled the small space.

The Blighted didn't cough. It didn't choke. It just got angrier. It screamed, a sound that made Lisbet cover her ears. Its skin began to blister, turning red and raw, but it didn't slow down. It threw itself harder against the bars.

"Respiratory system is redundant," Aris noted, typing furiously. "It absorbs oxygen through the skin. Conventional chemical warfare is ineffective."

He tried another canister. "Acidic compound. Corrosive class 4."

He sprayed it. The creature's skin melted, revealing black muscle underneath. It should have been dead. Instead, it reached through the bars, trying to grab Aris's coat.

"Pain receptors offline," Aris muttered. "Fascinating. Fire works. Kinetic trauma works. But chemical warfare is ineffective. They have no nerve endings to transmit pain signals. They are biological tanks."

#### Scene 3: The Accident

The Blighted was in a frenzy now. The pain—or the stimulation of the damage—had driven it into a berserker state. It grabbed two of the rebar bars. Its hands smoked from the acid, but it didn't let go.

It pulled.

The metal groaned. The welds popped.

"It's bending the cage," Zephyr yelled. "Aris, stop! It's getting out!"

"Just a moment," Aris said, leaning closer. "I need to measure the tensile strength output. The muscle density must be..."

*SNAP.*

The bars broke. The creature exploded out of the cage.

It didn't go for Aris. It went for the smallest heat source.

It lunged for Lisbet.

"No!" Ria screamed.

She dove in the way. But her joints were still stiff from the cold. She was a fraction of a second too slow. Her metal hand grazed the creature's leg, but she missed the grab.

The Blighted hit Lisbet. Or it would have, if a child refugee named Pip hadn't been standing there. Pip, who had been following Lisbet around like a puppy, holding a toy robot.

The creature slammed into Pip. Teeth met throat. There was a spray of red blood, bright and shocking against the grey floor. The sound of tearing flesh filled the room.

#### Scene 4: The Apathy

The room erupted in chaos. Lisbet screamed.

*BANG.*

Hatcher didn't hesitate. He put a plasma bolt through the creature's spine. It dropped instantly, twitching on top of the dead child. The smell of burnt ozone mixed with the copper scent of blood.

Silence fell. A heavy, suffocating silence.

Aris stepped forward. He didn't look at Pip. He looked at the dead monster. He pulled out a scalpel and began to cut into its arm.

"Unfortunate variable," Aris said, his voice devoid of emotion. "But the data confirms the muscle density is 300% of human norm. The adrenal glands are enlarged to the size of walnuts. The metabolic rate is off the charts."

Angelica stared at him. She felt a cold rage building in her chest, hotter than the battery. She looked at the dead boy. She looked at the scientist measuring the monster that killed him.

She walked over to him. She slapped the notebook out of his hand. It clattered to the floor.

Aris looked up, surprised. "Miss Vance? I am conducting an autopsy. The tissue degrades rapidly."

"You killed a child," Angelica hissed. "You let it out. You played god and a boy is dead."

"I let it out?" Aris raised an eyebrow. "The cage failed. That is a structural engineering failure, not a biological one. And the child was... collateral. His caloric potential was low. He was a drain on resources."

Ria surged forward, grabbing Aris by the throat. She lifted him off the ground. Her metal fingers dug into his neck.

"I should kill you," she growled. "Right now. I should squeeze until your head pops."

"Do it," Aris wheezed, his face turning purple. "And who will open the blast doors? Who knows the codes? Who knows how to synthesize the vaccine? Kill me, and you all die in this tunnel."

He looked at Angelica.

"A death is a tragedy, Miss Vance," Aris said, gasping for air. "Data is eternal. Which one saves the human race? The boy is dead. The data might save a thousand boys. Do the math."

Angelica looked at Pip's body. Then she looked at Aris. She wanted to let Ria kill him. But she knew he was right. And she hated him for it.

"Put him down, Ria," she said softly.

Ria dropped him. Aris straightened his coat, picked up his notebook, and went back to work.

"Next time," Aris muttered, "we use titanium bars."

### Chapter 17: The Trial

#### Scene 1: The Mob

News of Pip's death spread through the small group of survivors they had picked up along the way. There were about twelve of them now—ragged, hungry people who looked to Angelica for leadership. They had trusted her. Now that trust was broken. It shattered like the glass of the Zenith dome.

They surrounded Aris. They had pipes, knives, and rocks. Their eyes were hard with grief and anger.

"He let it loose!" a woman shouted. She was Pip's aunt, a washerwoman named Mara. Her face was streaked with tears and dirt. "He killed the boy! He's a monster! He watched it happen and took notes! He didn't even flinch!"

"Hang him!" a man yelled. "Throw him to the Blighted! Let him see how it feels! Let him be the experiment!"

They surged forward. Aris backed against the wall, clutching his datapad. For the first time, he looked genuinely afraid. Not of death, but of the mob. Mobs were irrational. Mobs destroyed data. Mobs didn't care about the greater good. They cared about vengeance.

"I acted for the collective," Aris tried to reason, his voice high and thin. "The data I gathered..."

"Shut up about the data!" Mara screamed, throwing a rock. It hit Aris in the shoulder. He winced.

Aris held up a hand. "Listen to me! Logic dictates that one death is preferable to total extinction. I was testing the enemy's capabilities. Now we know they are immune to neurotoxins. That knowledge is worth a life. It is worth ten lives. If you kill me, you lose that knowledge. You lose the advantage."

The mob roared. They didn't care about logic. They cared that a boy was dead.

#### Scene 2: The Defense

Angelica stepped between the mob and Aris. She held her hands up. She looked small against the tide of anger, but her eyes were fierce.

"Stop!" she commanded. Her voice cracked, but it held authority. It was the Command Voice she had learned from Vane, even if she didn't have the magic to back it up.

"You defending him?" Mara spat. "He's one of them! A Zenith butcher! You're just like him! You rich kids, playing with our lives!"

"I know what he is," Angelica said. "He is a monster. He is cold. He is cruel."

"Then let us kill him!"

"We need him," Angelica said.

"We don't need a murderer! We need justice!"

"We need his brain," Angelica said. "He knows where 'Project Noah' is. He knows the map. He knows the codes to the ship's ecosystem. Without him, we wander in the dark until we starve or get eaten. Is that justice? Dying in the dark? Is that what Pip would want?"

She looked at the angry faces. She saw their pain. She felt it too. She wanted to step aside. She wanted to let them have their blood. But she couldn't.

"He is the only one who can open the door," Angelica said. "If you kill him, you kill yourselves. You kill your children. You kill the future."

Ria stepped up beside Angelica. She looked at Aris with pure hatred. "I want to kill him too," she said to the mob. "I want to rip his head off. But the Princess is right. He's the key. And you don't melt the key just because you hate the lock."

#### Scene 3: The Verdict

She turned to Aris. He was watching her, calculating the odds of her betrayal. He looked like a rat caught in a trap.

"You are on trial, Doctor," Angelica said. "And the verdict is guilty. You are guilty of negligence, of manslaughter, of being a cold-hearted bastard. You are guilty of thinking you are above us."

Aris opened his mouth to argue, but she cut him off.

"But the sentence is suspended," she said. "Because you are useful. You are a tool. And we don't throw away tools in the apocalypse. Not until they break."

She stepped closer to him, her golden eyes burning. She grabbed his lapel, pulling him down to her level.

"If you endanger this group again," she whispered, so only he could hear. "If you treat one more person as a variable... I will kill you myself. Not as a judge. As an executioner. I will burn you to ash, and I won't care about the data. Do you understand me? I will melt your brain out of your ears. I will make sure you feel every second of it."

Aris swallowed. He nodded. "Understood. The parameters are clear. Survival is the priority."

She turned back to the mob. "Let him work. But watch him. If he sneezes, tell me. He doesn't move without an escort. He is a prisoner who happens to be useful."

#### Scene 4: The Result

The mob dispersed, grumbling and angry. They didn't like it, but they respected her strength. They went back to their fires, muttering.

Ria spat at Angelica's feet. "You're soft, Vance. You should have let them tear him apart. It would have been cleaner. It would have been righteous."

"If they tear him apart, we die," Angelica said. "It's math, Ria. You like math."

"I like justice," Ria said. "That wasn't justice. That was politics. You're becoming one of them. You're becoming Vane. He would have made the same call."

Angelica flinched. That cut deeper than any knife.

She looked at the map Aris was drawing on the wall. It was detailed, precise. It showed a path to the Foundation. It was their only hope.

"I need his brain," Angelica said, feeling the weight of the decision settle on her like a stone. "I don't need his soul. I don't think he has one anyway. And maybe I'm losing mine. But I will get us to the end."

Aris looked up from his map. He smiled, a thin, bloodless expression. "A pragmatic decision, Miss Vance. You are evolving. Morality is a luxury of the safe. And we are not safe. We are efficient. And efficiency is how we win."

### Chapter 18: The Rift

#### Scene 1: The Split

The survivors didn't trust Angelica anymore. Saving Aris had cost her their faith. They saw her as one of the Zenith now—protecting her own kind at the expense of the little people. The mood in the camp was toxic. Whispers followed her everywhere.

A rival leader emerged. It was the brother of the scavenger Ria had killed in Chapter 2. A big man named **Torque**. He had found a sledgehammer and was rallying the dissenters. He was loud, charismatic, and angry. He was everything Angelica wasn't.

"We're leaving," Torque announced, standing by the fire. He pointed the hammer at Angelica. "We're not staying with the baby-killer and his pet princess. We're not fodder for your experiments."

"Where will you go?" Angelica asked calmly. She stepped forward, her hand near her knife. She tried to reason with his followers. She looked at Mara. "Mara, you know the lower sectors are flooded." Mara looked away. She looked at a man named Jax. "Jax, you need Aris's medicine." Jax spat on the ground.

"Sector 5," Torque said. "I heard there's a hydroponics bay there. Food. Water. No monsters. Just green plants and clean air."

"Sector 5 is a dead zone," Ria warned. "The structural supports failed. It's a vacuum. You'll suffocate before you get there. The air scrubbers are offline. I saw the readings."

"Better dead than lab rats," Torque spat. "Better free than led by Zenith trash. You think she cares about us? She only cares about the mission. She only cares about the ship. We're just fuel to her."

"That's not true," Angelica said. "I care about keeping you alive."

"Then let us go," Torque said. "Unless you're a tyrant like the Emperor."

Torque lunged. He swung the hammer. Angelica dodged, but barely. The hammer cracked the concrete where she had been standing.

She drew her knife. She didn't want to fight, but she had to. She swept his leg, knocking him down. She put the knife to his throat.

"I'm not a tyrant," she whispered. "If I were, you'd be dead."

She let him up.

#### Scene 2: The Goodbye

It wasn't a debate. It was a divorce.

Half the group packed up. They took their share of the water, their share of the blankets. They divided the supplies with a cold precision. They fought over the last tin of peaches. Torque took it.

The group that left was a mix of the desperate and the angry. Mara, the washerwoman. Jax, the mechanic with the bad cough. Old man Rivers, who had been a gardener. Sarah, a young girl who reminded Angelica of herself. Ten faces she would never see again.

Torque looked at Zephyr. "You coming, Goldie? Or you staying with the heavy metal?"

Zephyr looked at Angelica. He looked at Hatcher. He looked at the rope burns on his waist.

"I'm staying," Zephyr said. "I owe them money. And I don't trust Sector 5. It sounds too good to be true."

Torque laughed. "Suit yourself. Dying with your debtors is a hell of a way to go. You always were a fool, Zephyr."

Hatcher stepped forward. He looked at Torque. "If you see a sign that says 'Free Air', don't trust it. And check your corners."

"Go to hell, old man," Torque said. "I don't need advice from a washout."

They walked into the dark. Ten people. Ten lives walking into a vacuum. They carried torches, a line of light fading into the abyss. They sang a song as they left, an old Undercity ballad about freedom. It sounded like a dirge. The route they took was treacherous, a narrow catwalk over the primary coolant shaft. Angelica watched until the last torch flickered out.

#### Scene 3: The Silence

The fire felt smaller that night. The circle was tighter. The silence was louder. The empty spaces where the others had slept felt huge. The remaining survivors huddled closer, the absence of the others a physical chill.

Angelica watched them go. She stood at the edge of the light, watching their torches fade into the distance. She knew they were walking into death. She knew Sector 5 was gone. She had seen the schematics.

She almost called them back. She almost begged them. But she knew they wouldn't listen. They had made their choice. They chose hope over facts.

"You can't save everyone, kid," Hatcher said, stepping up beside her. He lit a cigar, the smoke acrid and comforting. "Some people are designated casualties. They choose their own exit."

"They're going to die," Angelica whispered. "They're going to walk into a room with no air and they're going to die. I can almost hear them gasping."

"Probably," Hatcher said. "But they'll die free. That counts for something. Down here, choice is the only luxury we have."

#### Scene 4: The Burden

Angelica sat down. She felt heavy. The leadership weighed on her like a physical mantle. It was crushing her.

"I failed them," she whispered. "I'm supposed to lead them. I drove them away. If I had just... been better."

"You are leading them," Hatcher said. "Leading isn't about making everyone happy. It's about making the hard calls. You saved Aris because he's the map. You let them go because they were dead weight. That's leadership. It's ugly, but it works."

"It feels like losing," Angelica said. "It feels like being Vane. It feels like I'm becoming the thing I hate."

"Leadership satisfies the ego," Hatcher said, blowing a smoke ring. "But it kills the sleep. Get used to the insomnia, Princess. It's part of the uniform. If you want to save the ship, you have to be willing to lose the passengers."

Angelica looked at Aris, who was sleeping—or pretending to—in the corner. She hated him. And she needed him. That was the terrible truth of survival. She had traded ten good souls for one bad one, because the bad one was useful. And she would do it again. She would trade a hundred souls to save the rest.

### Chapter 19: Kaelen's Weakness

#### Scene 1: The Faint

They were marching again. The air was getting thinner as they descended. The pressure was rising. The tunnels were endless, a maze of grey steel and dripping pipes. The only sound was the clang of boots on metal.

Kaelen was at the rear guard. He had been quiet all day. Too quiet. He was lagging behind, his steps heavy. He was leaning on his sword like a cane. He tried to lift a crate of supplies to prove he was fine, but his arms trembled and he dropped it. The contents spilled. Everyone looked at him.

He remembered the first time he met Angelica at the Academy. She had been fixing a drone, her hands covered in grease. He had offered her a handkerchief. She had refused. *I don't need your charity,* she had said. Now, he was the one who needed charity.

He remembered his sword training with his grandmother, **Matriarch Lilith**. She had hit him with her cane every time he faltered. *Pain is weakness leaving the body,* she had said. Now, all he felt was weakness. *Balance is everything,* his instructor had said. *If you lose your balance, you lose the fight.* He had lost his balance.

He stumbled. It wasn't a trip. His legs just folded. He tried to catch himself, but his hands were too weak. He hit the ground face first.

His sword clattered on the metal, a loud, ringing sound that made everyone jump.

"Kaelen!" Angelica rushed to him. She turned him over.

His face was terrifying. It wasn't just pale; it was translucent. His veins were blue tracks under paper skin. His lips were white. He was ice cold to the touch. He looked like a statue made of ice.

#### Scene 2: The Diagnosis

"Stop the march!" Angelica yelled. "We need a medic!"

Aris walked over. He didn't look concerned, just curious. He scanned Kaelen with his datapad.

"Advanced Anemia," Aris diagnosed. "Hypovolemic shock. The **Blood Price** is catching up. His bond consumes iron to manipulate shadows. He has been using it too much without caloric replacement. He is running on fumes. His body is eating itself. He has burned through his reserves."

"Fix him," Angelica demanded. "Do something."

"I need blood," Aris said. "Or iron supplements. We have neither. His body is cannibalizing his own red blood cells to feed the bond. If he casts one more shadow, his heart stops."

"Explain the biology," Angelica snapped. "Why is it failing now?"

"The Umbra bond requires a high concentration of hemoglobin to anchor the shadow matter to the physical plane," Aris lectured, as if discussing a lab rat. "Without sufficient iron, the bond begins to draw from the marrow. It is literally dissolving his bones to maintain the connection. He is hollow."

#### Scene 3: The Solution

Angelica looked at Kaelen. He was shivering, his eyes rolling back in his head. He was dying.

"He needs blood?" she asked.

"Ideally, a transfusion," Aris said. "But oral consumption is... inefficiently effective. It's a primitive method, but it works. The stomach can absorb the iron."

Angelica didn't hesitate. She rolled up her sleeve. She pulled her knife.

"Take it," she said to Kaelen.

Kaelen's eyes focused on the knife. He tried to push her away. He hallucinated his father, standing over him, disappointed. *Weak,* his father said. *Always weak. You can't even stand on your own feet.*

He saw the Headmaster, sneering. *A Night never begs.*

"No," he whispered, his voice a ghost. "You're the Captain. You need strength. I... I am expendable. Leave me. I was trained for this. The House before the Self."

"I'm the Captain," Angelica said, her voice shaking. "And that's an order, soldier. You don't get to die yet. You don't get to leave me."

She sliced her arm. A clean cut across the forearm. Red blood welled up, bright and hot.

Ria watched them. "He won't do it," she said. "He's too proud. He'd rather die than be a leech."

"Then he dies," Aris said. "A waste of a combat unit."

#### Scene 4: The Intimacy

She pressed the wound to his mouth.

It was visceral. It was intimate in a way that sex never was. It was horrifying.

Kaelen tried to pull away, but the hunger—the bond's hunger—took over. He drank. He latched onto her arm like a starving child.

Angelica gasped at the sensation. She felt her own strength draining away, flowing into him. It felt like being emptied. She watched the color return to his cheeks. She watched the shadows around him flare, strengthening as they fed. It was a transfer of life. It tasted like copper and salt to him, like salvation. It tasted like guilt.

It lasted for a minute. Then Kaelen pulled back, gasping, his mouth stained red. He looked at her with a mix of shame and adoration. He looked like a vampire who had just found religion. The blood on his lips was bright against his pale skin.

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm so sorry. I'm a monster."

"Don't be," Angelica said, bandaging her arm. She felt lightheaded, but strong. "Your blood is my blood. Literally. Now get up. We have a ship to find."

Kaelen stood. He looked stronger than he had in weeks. But he couldn't look her in the eye. He had fed on her. He had crossed a line. He picked up his sword, but it felt heavier than before, burdened with the weight of her sacrifice.

Aris checked his eyes. "Pupil response normal. Heart rate stabilizing. It worked. The bond is sated."

Kaelen wiped his mouth. "It tastes like fire," he whispered. "It tastes like the sun."

Lisbet walked over and touched Kaelen's arm with her gloved hand. "You look better," she said. "Less like a ghost. More like a person. Don't worry, Kaelen. The Princess has enough blood for both of you. She's got a big heart."

Kaelen managed a weak smile. "It's not her heart I'm worried about, Lisbet. It's her soul. I'm afraid I'm staining it."

"Love is a vampire," Hatcher muttered to Ria, watching them.

"Survival is a vampire," Ria corrected. "Love is just the vein."

### Chapter 20: Angelica's Burden

#### Scene 1: The Night Watch

They camped on a catwalk overlooking a massive chasm. It was the main ventilation shaft of the ship, a drop of miles into the dark. The wind howled up from the depths, smelling of decay and ozone. It was a lonely sound, like the universe breathing. The metal of the catwalk was freezing, sending a chill through her boots.

Angelica volunteered for the night watch. She couldn't sleep. Her arm throbbed where she had cut it. It felt like a heartbeat outside her body.

She sat on the edge, her legs dangling over the abyss. She held her datapad. She was scrolling through the list of names.

*Pip. Dead.*
*Lord Vermillion. Dead.*
*Torque. Presumed Dead.*
*The Scavenger. Dead.*

The list was getting longer. Every name was a failure. Every name was a weight.

#### Scene 2: The Weight

She felt the weight of every death. She felt the ghost of Pip tugging at her sleeve. She felt the judgment of the people who had left. The ghosts were getting heavier. She checked the supply log. Water: 0 liters. Food: 0. They were running on fumes. The battery indicator on the heater was flashing red, a slow, hypnotic rhythm that counted down the minutes until they froze. It was a countdown not just to hypothermia, but to the end of their hope. Every blink of the red light was a reminder of how little time they had left.

She tried to fix a broken relay on her belt just to keep her hands busy. She tightened the screws until her knuckles turned white. It was a simple task, a mechanical task. It was the only thing she could control.

She closed her eyes and drifted into a half-sleep. She saw Leo. He was standing on the other side of the chasm. He looked healthy. He was wearing Zenith clothes.

*You're doing it wrong,* Leo said. *You're trying to save everyone. You can't.*

*I have to,* Angelica argued in the dream. *That's the job. That's why I'm here.*

*The job is to win,* Leo said. *Not to be a saint. Vane was right. You have to be harder.*

*I don't want to be hard,* she whispered.

*Then you'll break,* Leo said, and fell into the dark.

She remembered her mother teaching her the constellations. *They aren't real stars, Angie,* her mother had said. *They are lights on the dome. But we can still wish on them.* Now the dome was gone, and there were no wishes left.

She remembered her father talking about the engine. *It needs pressure to run, Angie. If the pressure drops, the fire goes out.* She was the engine now.

She remembered seeing the Spire for the first time as a child. It had looked like heaven. Now she knew it was just a penthouse on a sinking ship. The memory of the golden light seemed cruel now, a promise that was never meant to be kept.

She remembered Vane's lesson. *Acceptable losses, Angelica. You can lose a pawn to save a queen. But you can't lose the king.* She wondered who the king was. Was it her? Or was it the mission?

She saw the ghost of the Scavenger she had watched die. He was pointing at her. *You didn't help me,* he whispered. *You let me die.*

She woke up with a gasp. She was alone.

#### Scene 3: The Pride

"You're not God, Princess," Zephyr said gently. He sat down beside her. He looked at the datapad. "Stop counting. It doesn't help. The numbers don't change."

"I have to count," Angelica said. "Someone has to remember them."

"You're just a girl with a glow-stick," Zephyr said. "You're not Atlas."

"I'm not a girl," Angelica said. She put on her headset. She adjusted the frequency, listening to the static of the dead channels. "I can't be 'Angie' anymore. I can't be the Silt-rat who fixes toasters. That girl died when the Spire fell."

She looked at her reflection in the dark screen. Her eyes were gold. Her face was hard. She didn't recognize herself.

"I have to be Vance," she said. "The Commander. The one who makes the calls. The one who sends people to die. The one who cuts her own arm to feed the beast."

Ria sat down on her other side. "Vane would be proud," she said. "That's what he wanted. A weapon."

"I'm not his weapon," Angelica said. "I'm my own."

"Are you?" Ria asked. "Because you sound just like him. 'The ends justify the means.' That's Vane's gospel."

"Vane enjoyed it," Angelica said. "I hate it."

She hardened her heart. She felt the soft parts of her turning to stone, just like Ria's skin. It was necessary. It was armor.

"What are the odds, Doc?" Angelica asked Aris, who was awake.

"Of survival? 12%," Aris said. "Of success? 4%."

"I'll take those odds," Angelica said. "Better than zero."

"You're crazy," Hatcher said, walking up. "But you're the good kind of crazy. The kind that gets people killed for the right reasons."

"Is there a right reason to get people killed?" Angelica asked.

"Survival," Hatcher said. "It's the only reason that matters."

#### Scene 4: The Resolve

She looked into the abyss. Somewhere down there was the Foundation. Somewhere down there was the truth about the ship.

"I will get us there," she vowed to the dark. "I will get us to the stars. And if I have to burn everything I am to do it, I will."

She stood up. She looked at Zephyr.

"Get some sleep, Zephyr," she ordered. "We march at 0400."

She walked away, her steps echoing on the metal. Zephyr watched her go.

"Aye aye, Captain," he whispered. But she was already gone.

ANGELICA (Internal Monologue): **"Heavy is the head that wears the headset. But someone has to wear it. And I'm the only one who fits. I will carry the weight until it breaks me. And then I'll carry it broken."**
