# Chapter 15: The Dance

The air in the Grand Ballroom of the Zenith Spire was not air. It was a cocktail of pheromones, expensive perfume, and the distinct, electrified ozone smell of high-grade magic.

Angelica stood near a refreshment drone that was shaped like a floating, silver swan. She held a glass of synth-wine that she had no intention of drinking, using it as a prop to keep her hands occupied. If she didn't hold the glass, she knew her hands would drift to the pockets of her dress, to the cold steel of the ball bearings hidden there.

And that would be a provocation.

She was already a provocation.

She could feel the eyes of the room on her. They were physical weights, pressing against the kinetic-dampening weave of her grey dress. The Highborns didn't stare openly—that would be gauche. They watched her from the corners of their eyes, through the reflections in their champagne flutes, via the mirrored surfaces of the floating drift-lights.

To them, she was a stain. A smudge of grease on a silk sheet.

"Don't let them see you bleed," she muttered, gripping the stem of her glass until her knuckles turned white. "If they see blood, they'll frenzy."

A server drone, a silent chrome disc with anti-grav suspenders, drifted past. It offered her a tray of hors d'oeuvres—tiny, geometric cubes of something that smelled like roasted pheasant and truffle oil. Angelica waved it away. She didn't trust the food. In the Silt, if something smelled this good, it was usually bait.

She scanned the room, cataloging threats. It was a habit she couldn't break.

The ballroom itself was a weapon of intimidation. It was a vast, circular chamber located at the very apex of the Spire, suspended in the upper atmosphere. The walls were made of active-camo glass, currently set to 100% transparency.

There was no floor. Or rather, the floor was transparent too.

Three thousand feet of empty air separated the soles of their boots from the churning smog layer of the Middle Tier. If you looked down, you could see the distant, flickering lights of the industrial sectors, looking like embers in a dying fire. If you looked up, through the geodesic dome, you could see the stars—cold, hard, and uncaring.

It was designed to make you feel small. It was designed to remind you that the only thing keeping you from falling into the abyss was the grace of the Zenith Council.

"Do not look down," Angelica whispered to herself.

_CORRECTION,_ Aeon's voice resonated in her skull, vibrating against her mastoid bone. _LOOK DOWN. ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURAL SUPPORTS INDICATES A 0.004% PROBABILITY OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE. HOWEVER, VERTIGO INDUCES A VESTIBULAR RESPONSE THAT MIMICS FEAR. DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU SWEAT._

"I'm not sweating because of the height," Angelica muttered, keeping her lips barely moving. "I'm sweating because I'm in a room with three hundred apex predators, and I'm wearing a target."

The room was divided by invisible power lines.

In the center, dominating the dance floor, was **House Aurum**. They were the sun around which everything else revolved. Their members wore gold-weave suits and gowns that actually emitted a faint, bioluminescent glow, powered by their own bio-electric fields. They moved with the languid confidence of people who owned the very air everyone else breathed. They were the bankers, the investors, the ones who decided which sectors got power and which ones starved.

To the south, near the massive obsidian fireplace that burned with smokeless, violet chemical fire, was **House Ignis**. They were the warmongers. They were loud, boisterous, wearing reds and oranges that looked like flowing magma. They drank heavy, spiced liquors and laughed with their mouths wide open, showing teeth that had been sharpened for aesthetic intimidation. Angelica watched a group of Ignis cadets playing a game with a knife and a table, their reflexes enhanced by combat-stimulants. They were reckless, dangerous, and utterly confident in their ability to burn anything that stood in their way.

"Too much heat," Angelica noted. "They burn bright, but they burn fast."

And in the shadowy corners, adhering to the architecture like expensive black mold, was **House Night**. They were the spies, the assassins, the intelligence gatherers. They were silent. They wore black and silver—velvet that drank the light, silk that shimmered like moonlight on dark water. They didn't laugh. They whispered. And when they looked at you, you didn't feel seen; you felt assessed. You felt like a file being opened on a desk.

"House Night," Angelica murmured. "The ones who write the history because they're the only ones left alive to hold the pen."

Angelica moved slightly, shifting her weight. The Mylar panels in her skirt crunched softly—a sharp, mechanical sound that cut through the soft rustle of silk.

Heads turned.

"You're doing it again," a voice drawled.

Angelica didn't flinch. She knew that voice. It was the sound of breaking glass.

She turned slowly.

Lady Corinne of House Aurum stood three feet away. She wasn't alone. She was flanked by two sycophants from House Verdant—twin girls with vines woven into their hair who looked at Corinne with a mixture of adoration and terror.

Corinne was a vision of lethal perfection. She was wearing a dress made of woven light-filaments. It wasn't fabric; it was hard-light projection. It shifted color with her mood. Currently, it was a blinding, aggressive diamond-white.

"Doing what?" Angelica asked, her voice steady.

"existing," Corinne said. She took a sip of her golden wine, leaving a perfect crimson lip-print on the crystal. "You're contaminating the aesthetic, Ward. You smell like ozone and cheap rations. It's distracting."

"I thought the aesthetic was 'decadent boredom'," Angelica replied, tightening her grip on her glass. "In which case, I'm providing a public service. I'm giving you something to talk about besides your own reflection."

One of the Verdant twins gasped. Corinne's eyes narrowed, and her dress rippled, shifting from white to a pale, icy blue.

"You have a sharp tongue for a mechanic," Corinne said softly. "But tongues can be removed. My father has a collection of them in jars. He calls it his 'Silence Library'. He says the silence of a thousand critics is the sweetest music in the world."

Angelica felt a chill that had nothing to do with the air conditioning. The Silence Library. It was a rumor in the Silt—a story used to scare children. _Be quiet, or Lord Aurum will put your tongue in a jar._

Hearing it confirmed, casually, at a party, made her stomach turn.

"And you smell like desperation and expensive perfume," Angelica countered, pushing past the fear. She couldn't show weakness. Not here. "I wasn't aware 'pretentious' was a protected species, or I would have brought a permit."

The air around them dropped ten degrees. The condensation on Angelica's glass froze into frost.

Corinne smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. It was the smile of a cat that has just cornered a mouse and realizes the mouse has nowhere to run.

"Careful, silt-rat," Corinne whispered. "You are guests here. And guests can be... uninvited."

She raised a hand. Her fingers were manicured to sharp points, painted with lacquer that contained actual crushed diamond dust.

She pointed a finger at Angelica's chest.

"Return to the gutter," Corinne commanded. "Before I melt that scrap-metal dress to your skin."

Angelica braced herself. She shifted her stance, dropping her weight into her heels. Her hand moved toward her pocket.

_WARNING,_ Aeon chimed. _ENERGY SPIKE DETECTED. LOCALIZED THERMAL BUILDUP. SHE IS CHARGING A PLASMA BOLT._

Corinne feigned a stumble. It was a graceful, choreographed trip. As she lurched forward, her finger "accidentally" jerked upward towards Angelica's face.

A small orb of superheated plasma formed at her fingertip. It was the size of a marble, swirling with white-hot energy. It wasn't a war-grade blast, but at this range, it would burn through flesh and bone instantly. It was a maiming shot. A scar maker.

It hissed through the air.

Angelica didn't have time to dodge. She didn't have time to trigger her ball bearings.

She flinched, raising her arm—

_ZZZRRRT._

The sound wasn't an explosion. It was a vacuum. A sudden, sharp intake of air.

The heat vanished. The blinding light of the plasma orb winked out of existence.

Angelica blinked, lowering her arm.

A hand was suspended in the air between her and Corinne. A black-gloved hand.

Kaelen Night stood there.

He hadn't blocked the shot. He had caught it.

His hand was surrounded by a faint, distortion field—a Null-Field. It looked like heat haze, blurring the air around his fingers. The plasma orb was gone, absorbed into the void of his magic.

Slowly, deliberately, Kaelen lowered his hand. He looked at his glove. There wasn't even a scorch mark.

Then, he looked at Corinne.

His eyes were black pits. No whites, no irises. Just void.

"Your control is slipping, Corinne," Kaelen said. His voice was low, smooth, and terrifiedly calm. It carried across the silence of the room. "Discharging plasma in a crowded room? How plebeian."

Corinne was frozen. Her dress had turned a chaotic, flickering grey—the color of fear.

"She... she provoked me!" Corinne stammered, pointing a trembling finger at Angelica. "She insulted House Aurum!"

"She exists," Kaelen corrected, bored. "That is provocation enough for the insecure."

He stepped forward. Corinne stepped back. The two Verdant twins had already vanished into the crowd, abandoning their leader.

"You are boring me, Corinne," Kaelen whispered. "And you know what I do to things that bore me."

He didn't make a threat. He didn't need to. The reputation of House Night did the work for him.

Corinne flushed a deep, ugly red. Her light-dress turned crimson to match. She looked from Kaelen to Angelica, her eyes burning with a hatred so pure it was almost impressive.

"This isn't over, Ward," she hissed. "The Selection hasn't even started."

She spun on her heel and stormed away, her dress leaving trails of angry red light in the air.

Angelica let out a breath she didn't know she was holding. Her knees felt shaky.

She looked at Kaelen.

"Thank you," she said stiffly.

Kaelen turned to her. He didn't smile. He looked her up and down, his black eyes scanning her grey dress, the blue LEDs, the Mylar plating. It wasn't a look of lust. It was a look of appraisal. He was looking at her the way a soldier looks at a new rifle.

"Don't thank me," Kaelen said. "I didn't do it for you. I did it because the smell of burnt flesh lingers in the upholstery. It ruins the carpet."

"Right," Angelica said. "The carpet. Of course."

"I collect useful things," Kaelen continued, stepping closer. He invaded her personal space, smelling of cold rain and old iron. "You, on the other hand, are merely decorative tonight. You look like a warship, Ward. Are you loaded?"

"Always," Angelica said.

Kaelen's lip twitched. A micro-smile.

"Good. Try not to get incinerated. You're no use to me if you're ash."

The orchestra, sensing the tension had broken, struck up a new song.

It wasn't a soft melody. It was complex, mathematical, and precise. Violins sawed in a rapid, staccato rhythm. Cellos provided a deep, ominous undercurrent. It was a waltz, but it was a waltz written by a mathematician.

_The Arithmancy Waltz in C Minor._

"Ah," Kaelen said, listening to the beat. "3/4 time. Variable tempo. A thinking man's dance."

He extended his hand. The black glove was leather, soft and expensive.

"Dance with me."

It wasn't a question.

Angelica hesitated. She looked at his hand. She looked at the room. Three hundred people were watching. Whatever anonymity she had left was gone. If she took his hand, she was declaring an alliance. She was painting a target on her back twice the size of the one she already wore.

"I don't dance," Angelica said.

"It is a waltz, Ward," Kaelen said, his hand not wavering. "It is physics. Momentum, torque, and trajectory. You understand physics. You understand levers and fulcrums."

He took a step closer.

"Treat me as a counterweight. Calculate the vector. Take my hand."

Angelica looked at him. She saw the challenge in his eyes.

"Fine," she whispered. "But if you step on my boots, I'm engaging the gravity spikes."

She placed her hand in his.

His grip was firm, cool, and dry. He pulled her onto the floor.

He didn't just lead; he commanded.

He pulled her into the frame. His right hand on her waist was like a steel clamp. He waited for the downbeat.

_ONE._

They moved.

Angelica gasped. The speed was incredible. Kaelen didn't glide; he cut. He moved across the floor with predatory efficiency.

"One, two, three. One, two, three," Angelica counted in her head, Ria's voice echoing in her memory.

_Plant the foot. Own the tile._

She planted her heavy combat boot. She pivoted. The Mylar skirt flared out, rigid and sharp, clearing a space around them.

They spun. The room blurred into streaks of gold and light.

They were dancing, but it felt like combat. Every turn was a parry. Every step was a thrust. Kaelen tested her balance, pushing her, pulling her, seeing if she would stumble.

She didn't.

She met his force with equal resistance. When he pushed, she grounded. When he pulled, she accelerated.

They moved through the crowd like a shark through a school of fish. Highborns scrambled to get out of their way.

Angelica's mind raced, translating the movement into data. _Centrifugal force increasing. Angular momentum conserved. Friction coefficient of the marble floor... nominal._

She wasn't dancing. She was solving a dynamic equation in real-time.

"You are adequate," Kaelen murmured, his lips close to her ear so only she could hear over the swelling music.

"High praise," Angelica grunted, focusing on not tripping over the hem of her dress. "Most partners don't require a degree in structural engineering to follow."

"Most partners are boring," Kaelen countered. "Turn."

He spun her. The world tilted. They passed a group of young officers in blue uniforms.

"House Argent," Kaelen whispered, narrating the room as they moved. "See the one with the monocle? Julian's cousin. He has a kinetic implant in his arm that can punch through a bulkhead. Don't let him shake your hand."

They dipped, narrowly missing a woman in a dress made of living vines.

"House Verdant," Kaelen continued. "Lady Vespera. She studies poisons. If she offers you a drink, pour it in a plant and watch it die."

He pulled her back upright.

"And there," he nodded toward a hulking figure near the buffet. "House Ferro. The Iron-Skins. They replace their bones with graph-steel alloy. Hard to kill, but they sink in water."

"Why are you telling me this?" Angelica asked, breathless. "I'm not a spy."

"Information is ammunition, Ward," Kaelen said. "And you are currently walking into a war zone unarmed."

"Most people try to follow me," Kaelen said, shifting the topic back to the dance as he executed a complex reverse-turn. "You... you fight me. It is interesting. You provide... resistance."

They spun near the edge of the floor, overlooking the drop. For a second, Angelica saw the abyss beneath her feet.

She didn't look down. She looked at Kaelen.

"Why are we doing this?" she asked. "Why bring me here? Why save me from Corinne? What do you want?"

Kaelen spun her back toward the center.

"The Selection begins tomorrow," he said. "The arena is a machine, Ward. A meat grinder designed by my ancestors to cull the weak and cement the power of the strong. It will try to grind us into paste."

He leaned back, holding her weight, spinning them in a tight, vertigo-inducing circle.

"I do not wish to be paste," he said. "And neither do you."

"So?"

"So I need a mechanic," Kaelen whispered. "I need someone who knows how to break the gears. I need someone who looks at a trap and sees a schematic. I watched your simulation scores. You solve problems proactively. You don't just survive the test; you dismantle the testing apparatus."

"Is that what I am?" Angelica asked, breathless. "Your wrench?"

"Precisely," Kaelen said, his voice devoid of warmth. "Do not mistake protection for affection, Angelica. You are not here to be admired. You are here to be calibrated. I am maintaining my equipment. If you slow me down, I will leave you behind. If you break, I will replace you. But until then... I will keep you sharp."

It was cold. It was brutal.

And it was honest.

Angelica respected it.

"Understood," she said, tightening her grip on his shoulder. "And if you try to use me as bait, I'll weld your door shut while you're sleeping."

Kaelen laughed. It was a rare, dark sound.

"Fair terms."

---

High above the dance floor, on the suspended VIP mezzanine, Duke Grey watched.

He leaned against the duraglass railing, sipping a glass of vintage water—real water, from a glacier, older than the Spire itself. It tasted of nothing, which was the most expensive flavor of all. In the Spire, 'flavor' was usually a chemical additive to disguise the taste of recycled filtration. Purity was the ultimate luxury.

Duke Grey was a man of numbers. He didn't see people. He saw ledgers. He saw assets and liabilities. He saw ROI.

"She is a blemish," a voice rasped beside him.

Grey didn't turn. He knew who it was by the smell—incense, old parchment, and dry rot.

High Inquisitor Voss of **House Sanctum** stood at the railing. Voss was a tall, gaunt man wrapped in robes of crimson and gold. A band of heavy silk covered his eyes—a 'Blindfold of Justice' that supposedly allowed him to see only the spiritual aura of a person, ignoring their physical form.

"Inquisitor," Grey said smoothly. "I wasn't aware the Church of the Gear took an interest in secular dancing."

"We take an interest in contagion," Voss replied, his voice like grinding stones. he pointed a skeletal finger toward the dance floor, unerringly aiming at Angelica. "That... creature. She reeks of the Silt. She brings the dust of the bottom on her boots. It is spiritually corrosive."

"Market analysis indicates she is a novelty," Grey countered continuously. "Novelty drives engagement. The ratings for the Selection pre-show have risen 12% since her name was announced. Corrosion, it seems, is profitable."

Voss spat on the floor. A servant drone immediately rushed to clean it up.

"Profit," Voss scoffed. "You merchants would sell the gears of the Great Engine if the price was right. You do not understand the sacred geometry of our society, Grey. The Pyramid must remain stable. The base must support the peak. If you allow the base to climb... the structure collapses."

"Or," Grey mused, swirling his water, "it evolves."

He looked down at Angelica. He focused his ocular implants, bumping the magnification to 50x. He could see the tension in her jaw. He could see the way she tracked the room's exits while waltzing.

"The Night boy," Grey murmured. "He is compromising himself."

"He is tainted," Voss corrected. "House Night has always flirted with the darkness. They walk too close to the edge. Kaelen Night is... unstable. I see his aura. It is fractured. And now he binds himself to this... waste."

"Market analysis indicates a 40% drop in House Night's social stock due to association with a Lowborn," an advisor from Grey's entourage droned, reading from a holographic tablet.

"Short term," Grey dismissed with a wave of his hand. "Look at the long game. Kaelen never spends social capital unless he expects a return. He sees something in the girl."

"He sees a tool," Voss said. "A disposable implement. But tools can break. And when they break, they can damage the hand that holds them."

Grey smiled thinly.

"Perhaps. Or perhaps she is an undervalued stock."

He watched Kaelen spin Angelica. He saw the way she held her own. He saw the defiance. It wasn't the defiance of a rebel; it was the defiance of a survivor.

"Chamberlain Hives," he called out.

A small, wizened man with ink-stained fingers stepped forward from the shadows of the advisors.

"My Lord?"

"Increase the interest rate on House Night's debt by three percent," Grey ordered calmly. "They are acting erratically. Risk premium."

"Done."

"And," Grey added, his eyes locked on Angelica, "place a side wager on the girl."

Hives blinked. "The Silt-rat? To win?"

"To survive the first round," Grey said. "The odds are long. But the payoff is substantial. Put ten thousand credits on her. call it... a hedge."

Voss laughed. It was a dry, rattling sound.

"You throw your money into the furnace, Grey. She will be dead within the hour of the opening cannon. The purging is inevitable."

"We shall see," Grey said. "The fascinating thing about furnaces, Inquisitor, is that they refine as often as they destroy. Let's see if she's iron... or just rust."

Voss turned away, his robes sweeping the floor. "I will pray for your portfolio, Duke. It seems you have invested in a sinking ship."

Grey didn't answer. He watched the dance. He watched the way the 'Silt-rat' moved. And for a brief second, his thermal sensors picked up a strange anomaly—a tiny, localized heat spike near her hair, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.

_Interesting,_ Grey thought. _Very interesting._

---

The waltz ended with a final, dramatic crescendo.

Kaelen bowed formally. It was a sharp, mocking motion. Angelica curtsied, her stiff skirt scraping the floor.

"Rest," Kaelen ordered. "Hydrate. The real game starts at midnight."

He turned and disappeared into the crowd, heading toward a group of House Night elders who looked like they were plotting a funeral.

Angelica turned to leave the floor. Her adrenaline was fading, leaving her legs trembling. She needed water. She needed to get away from the lights. But more than that, she needed air. Real air. Not the recycled, perfumed miasma of the ballroom.

She saw a set of heavy duraglass doors partially obscured by a velvet curtain. Without checking to see if she was being watched, she slipped through them.

The cold hit her instantly.

It was freezing. At this altitude, the air was thin and bitingly cold. Ideally, she should have been shivering, but the adrenaline still coursing through her veins kept her warm.

She was on a narrow maintenance balcony, a strip of grate-metal that ringed the Spire's upper dome. It wasn't meant for guests. It was meant for the drones that cleaned the windows.

"You're not supposed to be out here," a voice said.

Angelica pivoted, her hand going to her pocket.

A figure was leaning against the railing, obscured by the shadows of a support strut. The tip of a cigarette glowed bright orange—a stark contrast to the blue-white of the city lights below.

"Neither are you," Angelica replied, recognizing the silhouette. "House Argent doesn't lurk."

Julian Argent stepped into the light. He looked different than he had at the entrance. He had shed his formal jacket, revealing a white silk shirt with the sleeves rolled up. On his left arm, the silver lines of his kinetic implant gllimmered faintly under the skin, pulsing with a soft, rhythmic light.

"We don't lurk," Julian agreed, blowing a stream of smoke into the wind. "We hold strategic positions. Currently, this position offers the best tactical advantage: silence."

"What's that?" Angelica asked, nodding at the cigarette. "I thought open flames were banned in the upper tiers."

"It's real tobacco," Julian said, looking at the ember. "Grown in the Verdant private gardens. Cost me two hundred credits for the pack. And yes, it's illegal. Which makes it taste better."

He looked at her, a wry smile touching his lips. It wasn't the sneer he had worn in the ballroom entrance.

"Don't look so surprised, Ward," he said, noting her wary expression. "Inside that room? I'm an Argent. I play the part. I sneer, I threaten, I make sure the hierarchy is respected. It's theater. But out here? With the wind and the smog? I'm just a guy who hates the opera."

He offered the pack to her. "Want one? It helps with the nerves. I saw you dancing with Kaelen. You looked like you were trying to dismantle him."

"I was trying not to get my toes broken," Angelica said, declining the smoke. She walked to the railing and looked down.

The view was vertigo-inducing. The world dropped away into a sea of clouds and smog. Somewhere, miles down, was the Silt. It was just a dark stain on the earth from up here.

"He likes you," Julian said unexpectedly.

Angelica snorted. "He likes that I'm useful. There's a difference."

"For Kaelen? No, there isn't," Julian said. He tapped ash over the railing, watching it fall into the abyss. "Kaelen wants to win the game. He sees pieces on a board. I just want to see if the board breaks. But Night? He doesn't have friends. He has assets. If he's investing time in you, it means he thinks you have a high yield."

"Is that a warning?"

"It's a fact," Julian said. He turned to face her, his eyes serious. "Do you know what the Selection used to be? Before the cameras? Before the betting?"

Angelica shook her head. "A war?"

"A test," Julian corrected. "A hundred years ago, when the Atmospheric scrubbers first failed, the Selection was a way to find the engineers capable of fixing them. It was a meritocracy. The Ironborn weren't gladiators; they were saviors. But then... the scrubbers got fixed. The crisis ended. And the Highborn houses realized they had a lot of angry, powerful people with nothing to do."

He gestured vaguely at the ballroom behind them.

"So they turned it into this. A circus. A way to prune the population and keep the Silt distracted. If the Lowborn are too busy betting on who dies, they won't notice they're starving. And Corinne... she's the perfect product of this system. She doesn't want to fix anything. She just wants to win."

"She hates me," Angelica said. "It's personal."

"For her, everything is personal," Julian said. "Because she has nothing else. Take away the status, take away the fear she inspires, and she's just a terrified girl in a dress that cost more than a sector's annual budget. That's why she hates you, Ward. You have something she doesn't."

"What? Dirt under my fingernails?"

"Purpose," Julian said quietly. "You're fighting for something. She's just fighting against insignificance."

"She tried to melt my face," Angelica said dryly. "She's doing a good job of leaning into the 'insignificance' thing."

"She'll try worse," Julian said darkly, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Be careful, Ward. The Selection isn't just about fighting monsters in an arena. It's about surviving the monsters in the locker room. Corinne has... trophies. She likes to collect things from people she beats."

"I noticed," Angelica said dryly. "She tried to melt my face."

"She'll try worse," Julian said darkly. "Be careful, Ward. The Selection isn't just about fighting monsters in an arena. It's about surviving the monsters in the locker room. Corinne has... trophies. She likes to collect things from people she beats."

Angelica felt a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold. "Trophies?"

"Don't ask," Julian said, flicking his cigarette butt over the edge. "Just... watch your back. And maybe check your pockets. She likes to plant trackers."

He pushed himself off the railing. "I should go back. My father will be wondering if I've defected."

He paused at the door.

"You dance well, for a mechanic," he added. "You have good balance."

"Gravity is predictable," Angelica said. "People aren't."

Julian smiled—a genuine, tired smile. "Ain't that the truth. Good luck, Ward. Try not to die tomorrow. It would be a waste of a good dress."

He slipped back inside, leaving Angelica alone with the wind and the stars.

She stood there for another moment, letting the cold seep into her bones, grounding her. She looked at the door where Julian had vanished, then at the dance floor where Kaelen was holding court.

The contrast scraped against her mind. Kaelen looked at her and saw a wrench—a tool to be kept clean and sharp until it broke. Julian looked at her and saw a glitch in the matrix—something fascinating because it didn't belong.

_I'm not sure which is more dangerous,_ she thought. _The one who wants to use me, or the one who wants to watch me burn just to see the color of the flame._

She looked down at the Silt one last time.

_I'm coming back,_ she promised herself. _And I'm bringing this whole rusted tower down with me._

She turned and went back inside.

The heat of the room hit her like a physical wall. The noise, the smell, the lights—it was overwhelming. She needed to find a quiet corner to recalibrate before the midnight announcements.

She walked toward a marble pillar, seeking the shadows.

She didn't see Corinne.

Corinne was waiting behind the pillar. She wasn't holding a drink. She was holding a grudge. And in her hand, hidden in the folds of her light-dress, she held a spell.

It wasn't plasma this time. That was too loud. Too visible.

This was a curse. An Aging Curse.

It was a nasty piece of House Aurum blood-magic. It stole time. It withered skin, greyed hair, and brittleized bones. It took years off a life in seconds.

Corinne waited until Angelica passed. Then, she struck.

_She thinks she can stand on the same balcony as me?_ Corinne thought, her hand tightening around the spell. _She thinks a dress changes what she is? I'll show her what time does to trash._

"Happy birthday, rat," Corinne whispered.

She thrust her hand forward. A beam of sickly, grey light shot toward Angelica's back.

Angelica didn't see it. She didn't feel it.

But Aeon did.

The tiny gryphon drone, disguised as a silver hairpin in Angelica's up-do, woke up. His sensors screamed.

_ALERT. CHRONAL DISTURBANCE DETECTED. TEMPORAL ENTROPY SPIKE. THREAT LEVEL: EXISTENTIAL._

_PROTOCOL: FEED._

Aeon didn't warn Angelica. There was no time.

He opened his beak—a microscopic aperture. Within his throat, a microscopic singularity spun into existence. A tiny black hole, tailored to eat energy.

The grey beam hit the hairpin.

It didn't hit Angelica. It hit the singularity.

_SLURP._

The sound was audible only to dogs and bats. The beam twisted, distorted, and was sucked into the pin. The Aging Curse, containing twenty years of potential life-force, was consumed.

_PROCESSING..._ Aeon hummed. _ENERGY TYPE: CHRONAL. FLAVOR PROFILE: BITTER, WITH NOTES OF DESPERATION. CONVERTING TO BIO-ELECTRIC STIMULUS._

Aeon digested the time. It wasn't simple calories. It was entropy. It was the potential decay of twenty years, compressed into a singular point of data. He didn't just eat it; he decompiled it. He stripped the 'decay' variable from the equation, leaving only the raw potential energy of twenty unlived years.

Then, he injected it directly into Angelica's brainstem through the hairpin's conductive prongs.

_ZAP._

Angelica didn't just jolt. She detonated.

It wasn't just energy. It was _time_.

Aeon wasn't just giving her a boost; he was feeding her the twenty years Corinne had tried to steal, refined into pure, liquid adrenaline.

It hit her like a physical blow to the chest, a sledgehammer of light cracking her ribs open from the inside. But instead of pain, there was a rush of terrifying, golden euphoria. She tasted copper and ozone. She tasted the metallic tang of a thunderstorm caught in her throat. She saw flashes of things she had never lived—sunsets on planets she didn't know, faces of people she hadn't met, futures that were now dissolving into pure potential.

It felt like she had just injected pure caffeine into her soul, mixed with liquid starlight. It felt like sticking a fork in a socket, but the socket was connected to the sun.

Her heart hammered against her ribs, but it wasn't a panic rhythm. It was a war drum. _Thud-thud. Thud-thud._ Each beat sent a shockwave of revitalizing fire through her veins. Her exhaustion vanished. The ache in her feet from the combat boots disappeared. The mental fog of the last forty-eight hours burned away like mist under a flamethrower.

Her eyes snapped wide open. The world didn't just sharpen; it hyper-evolved.

The ballroom exploded into detail.

She could see the ultraviolet shimmer on the Highborns' skin-treatments, a hidden map of vanity. She could see the infrared heat signatures of the hidden guards stationed in the ventilation ducts, glowing like red ghosts in the ceiling. Time seemed to slow down, the seconds stretching into minutes. She could see the dust motes floating in the air, spinning like tiny planets, each one catching the light in a distinct, mathematical orbit.

She could hear everything. The rustle of silk was a roar. The clinking of crystal glasses was a cacophony of bells. She could hear the heartbeat of the person next to her—a slow, terrified _thump-thump_ that sounded like a hammer hitting wet leather.

She was vibrating. Not with fear, but with an excess of existence. She had too much life in her body. The universe felt small, fragile, like she could reach out and crush the Spire between her thumb and forefinger.

She spun around. Her movement was a blur, faster than humanly possible. To the onlookers, she didn't turn; she simply _was_ facing the other way, as if the frames of reality had skipped.

She faced Corinne.

Corinne was standing there with her hand extended, a look of triumphant malice on her face. That look crumbled into confusion, then horror, as the grey beam vanished into Angelica's hair without leaving a scratch.

"What..." Corinne gasped. "Where did it go?"

Angelica stared at her. Her pupils were dilated to the point of blackness, two wells of void drinking in the light. Her irises glowed with a terrifying, electric violet light—the color of a dying star.

She felt... incredible. She felt infinite.

She took a step toward Corinne. The marble floor seemed to groan under her boot, as if her weight had increased ten-fold.

Corinne flinched back against the pillar. She looked at the vase of flowers on the pedestal next to her.

The flowers, caught in the temporal displacement eddy of Aeon's meal, withered instantly. They turned brown, dried up, and crumbled to grey dust in a second, the petals falling like ash.

Corinne saw the dust. She looked at Angelica.

She realized, with a dawn of horror, that her curse hadn't failed. It had been _eaten_.

"You..." Corinne whispered, her voice trembling. "What are you?"

Angelica smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. It wasn't a polite smile. It was a feral, dangerous smile, fueled by twenty years of stolen time-energy. It was the smile of a predator that had just realized it was higher on the food chain than it thought.

"Did you feel that draft?" Angelica asked, her voice vibrating with power, a resonance that seemed to buzz in Corinne's teeth. "Someone should close a window. It feels... deadly."

She leaned in close to Corinne's face. She could smell the fear on her—it smelled like sour milk and expensive perfume.

"Don't play with time, Corinne," she whispered, her voice a low hum. "You might run out."

She patted Corinne's cheek—a condescending, terrifying gesture. It was a touch that said, _I could break you, but you aren't worth the effort._

Then she walked away. She didn't walk; she glided, her movements fluid and precise.

_GOOD BIRD,_ Angelica thought, the words projecting loud and clear to the drone, booming in her own skull.

_DELICIOUS,_ Aeon replied, sounding like a satisfied cat curled up by a fire. _SPICY. A BIT ACIDIC. BUT ACCEPTABLE. I REQUIRE DESSERT. PERHAPS SOMETHING WITH LESS... HATRED._

_Later,_ Angelica promised. _We'll find you a battery._

She walked out onto the balcony, bypassing the crowd. They parted for her, unsettled by the energy radiating off her skin. She walked past Julian Argent, who was lighting another cigarette. He paused, the lighter flame hovering in mid-air, and watched her go with wide, calculating eyes.

She stepped into the cold night air. The wind whipped her grey dress, making the blue lights flicker like dying stars.

She looked at the sky. The smog had cleared for a moment, revealing the vast, indifferent darkness of space.

"Let the Selection begin," she whispered to the void, her voice carried away by the wind. "I'm ready to break something."
