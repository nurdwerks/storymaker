**Archetype:** The Brotherhood / The Elite Guard
**True Sin:** PRIDE (They view themselves as genetically superior beings).
**Virtue Mask:** DISCIPLINE (They claim their predatory smirks are just "Vigilance").

## I. Role in the Story

The Grey Hounds are a squad of elite, genetically perfected guards who are fiercely loyal to Duke Valerius Grey. They are more than soldiers; they are the physical manifestation of the Duke's power.

- **The Bond:** They share a bond of brotherhood with Grey, having served in his campaigns. This wall of shared trauma and history is impossible for Angelica to breach.
- **The Threat:** They salute Grey with genuine respect but smirk at Angelica, making her feel unsafe and unwanted even in her own residence. They are a constant, silent reminder that the palace is a fortress, and she is the prisoner.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 15: The Game of Gears](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1270-1290)
- **Defining Quote:** "The rest were now loyal only to fear." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: PRIDE/BREAKING)
