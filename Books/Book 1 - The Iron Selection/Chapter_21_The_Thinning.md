## Chapter 21: The Thinning

### Scene 1: The Montage

- **Key Event:** The passage of time in the Arena.
- **Detailed Description:** It is Day 40. The "Iron Selection" has dragged on longer than any previous year. The Clockwork City, once gleaming with brass and polished steel, has begun to rust. The constant steam venting and the blood of the fallen have corroded the gears. The city moves slower now, grinding with a sound like dying whales. The environment is hostile. Food is scarce. Water is tainted with hydraulic fluid.

- **Key Event:** Physical deterioration of Squad Iron.
- **Detailed Description:** The squad has changed physically.

  - **Angelica** is skeletal. Her cheekbones jut out sharply against her pale skin. Her eyes are sunken, dark circles bruising the skin beneath them. She moves with a jittery, nervous energy, fueled by adrenaline and sleeplessness.
  - **Kaelen** has adapted by entering micro-sleep states. He functions perfectly for 4 hours, then shuts down for exactly 20 minutes, guarded by the others. His uniform is shredded, revealing scars upon scars, but his blades remain immaculately polished.
  - **Ria** has undergone the most drastic change. She spends 80% of her time in Titan-Form. The magical strain has permanently discolored her skin to a dull gunmetal grey. She speaks less. She eats raw vermin when she finds them. She is becoming the monster she summons.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — The erosion of her humanity. She looks at her hands and does not recognize them. They are weapons first, hands second.

### Scene 2: The Betrayal

- **Key Event:** The supply drop.
- **Detailed Description:** A chute opens in the sky. A single white crate descends on a parachute, landing in the center of a neutral intersection known as "The Crossroads." It is a taunt. It is labeled "Rations." Squad Iron moves toward it. They are desperate. They haven't eaten in three days.

- **Key Event:** The confrontation with Squad Copper.
- **Detailed Description:** As they reach the crate, three other figures emerge from the ruins. It is Squad Copper. They are former classmates from the Undercity Academy. Jax, Sam, and Trent. They look as bad as Iron—starved, wild-eyed, desperate. Jax holds a sharpened pipe. Sam holds a shard of glass. Trent has a rock.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Jax:** "Back off, Ward. We saw it first."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Jax? It's us. We sat next to each other in Mech-Theory."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Jax:** "That was a lifetime ago. Back off."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We can split it. Look at the size of the crate. Enough for everyone to get one day's rations. We don't have to fight."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Trent:** "No splitting. We take it all. We need it all."

- **Key Event:** The attack.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica steps forward, hand out, trying to de-escalate. Sam, a girl who used to borrow Angelica's notes, lunges. Her eyes are wide, pupils dilated with starvation madness. She screams, a high, thin sound, and slashes at Angelica's throat with the glass shard.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Sam:** "I'm hungry! I'm so hungry! Give it to me!"

### Scene 3: The Execution

- **Key Event:** Ria reacts.
- **Detailed Description:** There is no hesitation. Ria enters Overload Mode. Her arm blurs. She catches Sam's wrist. There is a snap of bone. She does not stop. She spins and backhands Jax with her Titan-enhanced fist. His neck snaps with a dry crack. He falls instantly dead.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen's efficiency.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen appears behind Sam, who is screaming about her broken wrist. He places a hand over her mouth and drives a blade into the base of her skull. She goes limp. Silence returns to the intersection.

- **Key Event:** The prisoner dilemma.
- **Detailed Description:** Trent is left. He drops the rock. He falls to his knees, weeping. "I surrender! I surrender! Please, Ria, it's me! Trent!" Ria stands over him, her breathing heavy, her eyes devoid of recognition.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ria, don't! He surrendered!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "We cannot carry prisoners. We cannot feed prisoners. He is a caloric liability."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He tried to kill you, Angel."

- **Key Event:** The kill.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria brings her fist down. It is a wet, crunching sound. Angelica turns away and vomits bile onto the rusted street. She wipes her mouth. She walks to the crate. She opens it. Inside are twelve protein bars. She takes one. She eats it. It tastes like ash and guilt.

### Scene 4: The Change

- **Key Event:** The night watch.
- **Detailed Description:** That night, they camp in a ventilation shaft. Ria sleeps deeply, snoring softly. Angelica sits with Kaelen. She is shivering, though it is not cold.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "She's losing it. Did you see her eyes? She didn't even blink. She popped Jax's neck like a bottle cap."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "She prioritized the threat. She protected the squad."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I don't want to survive if I turn into that. I don't want to be a machine."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen's comfort.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen looks at her. He reaches out a gloved hand and touches her cheek. It is wet.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You won't."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "How do you know?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Because you are crying. Machines don't cry. Machines don't vomit when they terminate an error. Your hardware is intact."

- **Key Event:** The tear.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen catches a teardrop on his finger. He holds it up to the faint light coming from the ventilation grate. It glistens like a diamond.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Hold onto this. This inefficiency... this pain... it separates us from the Chimera. It separates us from them."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (mumbling in sleep):** "We aren't students anymore."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Survivors. But what are we surviving for?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Tomorrow."
