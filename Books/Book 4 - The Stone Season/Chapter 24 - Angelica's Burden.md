### Scene 2: The Weight

- **Key Event:** Angelica has a hallucination or vivid dream of **Leo**, who tells her that she must become "harder" and stop trying to be a "saint" to survive.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Faces the internal conflict of leadership: whether she is the "Captain" or just "Angie," the silt-rat who fixes toasters.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo (Vision):** "Vane was right. You have to be harder. Or you'll break."

### Scene 3: The Pride

- **Key Event:** Angelica admits to Zephyr and Ria that she is "turning to stone" and hardening her heart as armor, effectively adopting Vane's "end justifies the means" philosophy.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Accepts her new persona as "Ward, the Commander," rejecting her past identity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I have to be Ward. The one who sends people to die. The one who cuts her own arm to feed the beast."

### Scene 4: Joyce's End

- **Key Event:** Joyce's mind finally gives out. Years of suppressed trauma and the toll of the escape have emptied her brain. She collapses, breathing but vacant.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Joyce (The Needle)** — She looks at Corinne and smiles, but there is no recognition behind the eyes. She dies holding Corinne's hand, forgotten who she holds, only knowing she is safe.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "The tea is... ready. Would you... like some?"
  - **Key Event:** Hatcher feels the sudden, massive "hollow" of her final memory burning away, a resonance that hits his own scar. He realizes she is lost in the drift.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher (softly):** "The tea is hot, Joyce. And the door is locked. We're safe, aren't we?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "Safe. Yes. That's the word."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne (weeping):** "Yes, Joyce. The tea is perfect."
- **Key Event:** Before the light fades entirely, Joyce presses her knitting needles—revealed as stilettos—into Corinne's hands.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce (last words):** "You were never silly, Corinne. You were just... waiting."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Accepts the stilettos and the legacy they represent.

### Scene 5: The Resolve

- **Key Event:** Angelica vows to reach the Foundation and the "stars," even if she has to "burn everything she is" to do it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I will get us to the stars. And if I have to burn everything I am to do it, I will."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (Internal):** "Heavy is the head that wears the headset. But someone has to wear it. I will carry the weight until it breaks me. And then I'll carry it broken."
