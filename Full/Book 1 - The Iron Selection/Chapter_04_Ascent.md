# Chapter 4: Ascent

The industrial transport cage lurched, a violent, metallic scream of chains echoing through the dark loading bay. Angelica's hand slipped on the grease-slicked mesh of the wall, her knuckles scraping against the cold steel as forty-nine other bodies slammed into her. The "dregs" of the Undercity—scraped from the gutters of Sector 12 and packed shoulder-to-shoulder—became a single, panicking mass of unwashed skin and terror.

A massive man beside her, his chest a patchwork of burn scars, stumbled with the force of the ascent, his heavy boot crushing Angelica's toe. She bit her lip until the copper taste of salt and blood filled her mouth, but she didn't make a sound. She was a ghost in the machine, and ghosts didn't cry.

_CLANG._

The locking clamps disengaged with the finality of a guillotine. Then, gravity shifted.

The lift didn't rise; it yanked. The G-force slammed Angelica’s internal organs into her pelvis, knocking the breath from her lungs in a sharp _whoosh._ Outside the mesh, the dirty yellows and neon greens of the Silt began to blur into vertical streaks of sickness. The wind howled past the cage, a banshee scream that promised to tear them from the sky if the chains ever failed.

Angelica gripped the wire mesh, her fingers white-knuckled and trembling. She didn't look at the people; she looked at the machine. She listened to the oscillation of the guide rails and the rhythmic thrum of the 1.2 gigawatt drive mechanism. She focused on the math, because math was the only thing that made sense when the ground was disappearing.

"Here we go," someone muttered. A nervous, reckless whisper in the dark.

_CLANG._

The locking clamps disengaged. The sound was like a gunshot in a canyon, sharp and final.

Then, gravity shifted.

The lift lurched upward. It wasn't a smooth acceleration. It was a violent, brutal yank, as if a giant hand had grabbed the chain and jerked them toward the heavens with contempt. Angelica’s knees buckled under the sudden G-force. The breath was knocked out of her lungs as her internal organs were pressed down into her pelvis. The massive man next to her stumbled, his heavy, steel-toed boot crushing her toe, but she bit her lip until it tasted of salt and didn't make a sound.

They rose.

The light of the Undercity—the dirty yellows of the sodium lamps, the neon pinks of the pleasure districts, the sickly greens of the chemical runoff—began to blur into vertical streaks of color outside the mesh walls. The air rushed past them, a howling wind that tore at their clothes and whipped hair into eyes, screaming like a banshee.

Angelica gripped the steel mesh of the wall, her knuckles white, the wire digging into her skin. She looked out.

She watched the Silt fall away.

It was disappearing. The sprawling, chaotic shantytown that had been her entire universe was shrinking, folding in on itself. The Hab-Blocks, those towering monoliths of concrete that blocked out the sky and leaked sewage onto the streets, became toy blocks. The rivers of sludge were just oily veins pulsing through the gray flesh of the city. The fires of the burning pits were mere sparks, dying fireflies in the deep dark.

It looked... insignificant.

From down there, walking its streets, the Silt was a monster. It was a labyrinth that swallowed you whole. It was loud and angry and infinite. It was a living thing that wanted to eat you. But from here? From inside the belly of the beast rising to the sky? It was just a smudge. A stain on the bottom of the world. A petri dish of bacteria growing in the dark.

The realization hit her harder than the G-force. _It's so small._ All the pain, all the hunger, all the fighting over scraps, the nights spent shivering, the days spent running... it all happened in a shoebox.

_Flashback._

_She was seven. She was sitting on the roof of a derelict water tower in Sector 12, her legs dangling over the edge. It was a rare clear night—meaning the smog was only a light gray instead of charcoal black. She was watching the Great Lift._

_From the ground, it looked like a line of fire drawn in the sky. A distant, glowing bead of light moving up a thread of spider silk. It went up, up, up, until it vanished into the Cloud Layer._

_"Where does it go?" she had asked Grix, the old scavenger who taught her how to strip copper wire without electrocuting herself._

_Grix had spat a glob of black phlegm over the edge. "To the Zenith, girl. To the shiny people."_

_"What do they do up there?"_

_"They eat," Grix said bitterly. "They drink water that doesn't taste like rust. And they look down on us and laugh."_

_"Can we go?"_

_Grix laughed, a harsh, barking sound. "Only two things go up that lift, Angie. Ore to be melted, and trash to be burned. You wanna be ore or trash?"_

_Angelica had watched the light disappear into the clouds. "I want to be the person pushing the button."_

_Flashback End._

The lift picked up speed. The wind became a roar, drowning out the whimpers and prayers of the other candidates. The air pressure began to drop. Angelica felt her ears pop—_crack, crack_—and a dull ache started behind her eyes, a pressure building in her sinuses.

She closed her eyes and focused on the machine. She didn't see the blur of the city; she saw the schematics she had built in her mind.

_Drive mechanism: Magnetic Levitation assisted by counter-weight displacement. Power consumption: 1.2 Gigawatts per ascent. That’s enough energy to power Sector 12 for a year. They burn it in six minutes._

_Chain tension: Variable. I can feel the oscillation. The guide rails are misaligned at Level 9. Feel that shudder? That’s a 2mm variance in the track. Someone is skipping maintenance._

They passed Level 10. The factories.

Sparks showered down around the cage like golden rain as they flew past the welding yards. The heat radiated through the mesh, a sudden, blasting wave of dry warmth. Angelica opened her eyes for a second and saw vast, cavernous spaces filled with robotic arms assembling machines of war. Drones. Tanks. Walkers. Thousands of them, marching on conveyor belts.

They passed Level 8. The transit rings.

A blur of headlights. The hum of anti-grav engines. This was the highway of the mid-levels, a suspended ring of traffic where logistics drones and transport barges moved goods between the sectors. It was a river of light, flowing endlessly.

They passed Level 6. The administrative blocks.

Clean lines. Grey concrete. Boring. Uniform. This was where the clerks lived. The bureaucrats who stamped the forms that denied the Silt medicine.

The air was getting thinner. Colder. The temperature dropped twenty degrees in seconds. Frost began to form on the metal mesh of the cage.

The massive man next to her—Let’s call him ‘Tank’—was gasping now. He was clutching his chest, his face turning a mottled shade of purple. His lungs, likely filled with Silt-dust and scar tissue, couldn't handle the rapid decompression. He was drowning in the thin air.

"I can't... I can't breathe," Tank wheezed, grabbing Angelica’s shoulder. His grip was crushing, panic making him strong. "The air... where's the air?"

Angelica winced, twisting out of his grip. She looked up at him. She didn't feel pity; she felt a cold, analytical assessment. _Hypoxia. Panic attack. If he passes out, he’s dead weight. If he falls, he crushes me._

"Don't talk," Angelica whispered, her voice cutting through the wind. "Listen to me. Conserve oxygen. Swallow to clear your ears."

"My chest..." he groaned, his eyes rolling back. "It's crushing me."

"It's the pressure differential," she explained calmly, as if reading a manual. "Nitrogen is bubbling in your blood. Panic makes it worse. Slow your heart rate. Close your eyes. Count the rivets on the floor."

"What?"

"Count the rivets!" she snapped. "Focus on the math. Math uses less oxygen than fear."

He stared at her, eyes wide and bloodshot. But he did it. He looked down. He started muttering numbers. "One... two... three..."

Angelica turned back to the wall. _Good. He’s distracted. He won’t flail._

Then, they hit the Cloud Layer.

It was a wall of gray.

One second, they were rising through the geometry of the city; the next, they were blind. The world vanished, swallowed by a thick, swirling soup of moisture and pollutants. The condensation was instant. Water droplets formed on the mesh, on their skin, on their eyelashes. It was freezing. A wet, clinging cold that soaked through their thin clothes instantly, chilling the sweat on their bodies.

The lift shook violently. Turbulence.

The cage swung on its chains, banging against the guide rails. _CLANG. CLANG._

Screams erupted from the group. Someone threw up. The smell of bile mixed with the ozone and the wet wool smell of the clouds. It was a sensory nightmare. The world was spinning, shaking, and freezing all at once.

Angelica closed her eyes. She grabbed the mesh with both hands, anchoring herself. She focused on the vibration of the floor. She filtered out the screams, the wind, the cold. She listened to the machine.

_Thump-thump. Thump-thump._

The guide wheels were fighting the wind shear. The tension on the left chain was spiking.

_Systems check,_ she thought, grounding herself in the numbers. _Hydraulic pressure: fluctuating. Chain tension: high but within tolerance. Structural integrity: holding. Vertical velocity: 80 meters per second. Estimated time to breach: ten seconds._

_Five._

The light outside the gray changed. It shifted from charcoal to pearl.

_Four._

The air pressure stabilized.

_Three._

She felt the shift before she saw it. The humidity dropped.

_Two._

_One._

The cage punched through the top of the clouds like a fist breaking through a ceiling of dirty glass.

The gray vanished.

And there was the sun.

Angelica gasped, throwing her hands up to cover her face. It was blinding. It was searing. It wasn't the soft, filtered light of the grow-lamps in the hydroponic bays. It wasn't the neon glow of the signs. It wasn't the flicker of a fire.

It was a nuclear explosion hanging in a vast, terrifying expanse of blue.

It hurt.

Her eyes, adapted for the eternal twilight of the shadows, screamed in protest. The optic nerves misfired, sending white-hot spikes of pain into her brain. Tears streamed down her cheeks—not emotional tears, but a biological flush, her body trying to wash away the assault. The light felt physical, like a slap.

"Too bright," she whimpered, turning her head away, burying her face in her shoulder. "It's too bright."

Around her, the others were reacting the same way. Curses. Cries of pain. Men who had killed for a pair of boots, women who had survived gang wars... they were cowering from the sky. They were hunching over, shielding their eyes, hissing like vampires dragged into the dawn.

But slowly, the pain faded to a throb. The red spots in her vision began to clear.

Angelica blinked, squinting through her wet lashes.

She forced herself to look. She had to see it. She had to see what they had paid for.

Above them, the sky was a deep, impossible cobalt. It stretched on forever, a dome of infinite depth that made her dizzy just looking at it. And in the center, the sun—a white-gold coin—burned with an indifference that was terrifying. It was pure energy. Pure power.

And below...

She looked down through the mesh floor.

The clouds were a carpet. A rolling, churning ocean of gray wool that stretched horizon to horizon. They were lit from above now, white and fluffy, looking soft enough to sleep on. They hid the Silt. They hid the factories. They hid the smog and the rot and the pain.

It was beautiful.

And it was hateful.

_They keep this,_ she thought, the anger blooming cold and sharp in her stomach. _They live up here, in the blue and the gold, and they push the clouds down on us. They hoard the light._

She had always known the Zenith was separate. But she hadn't understood the geometry of it until now. It wasn't just a different neighborhood. It wasn't just a gated community. It was a different planet. They were the Light-Hoarders. And she... she was just a rat they had pulled up from the cellar to amuse themselves.

The lift began to slow. The G-force reversed, making her stomach lurch into her throat.

They were approaching the Spire.

It rose out of the clouds like a needle of crystallized light. A tower of glass and gold that seemed to defy gravity. It was impossibly tall, piercing the sky. Floating platforms orbited it like moons, held in place by invisible magnetic tethers. Ships—sleek, silver insects—docked at its sides, looking like parasites feeding on a giant host.

The lift climbed higher, passing the residential tiers.

Angelica pressed her face to the mesh. She saw gardens. Hanging gardens suspended in glass bubbles. Waterfalls cascading from the clouds. She saw trees—real trees with green leaves—growing in neat rows. She saw swimming pools that sparkled like sapphires.

"Look at that water," Tank whispered next to her. He had stopped counting. He was staring out, his mouth open. "It's... it's blue. Water ain't blue. It's brown."

"It's blue here," Angelica said softy. "Everything is clean here."

They passed Level 3. The Estates.

Mansions. Floating palaces. Gold statues.

They passed Level 2. The Commercial District.

And finally, they reached a massive, suspended platform jutting out from the side of the structure like a diving board.

_The Academy._

It looked like a fortress disguised as a cathedral. White marble walls that gleamed in the sun. Buttresses of transparent aluminum. Banners of red and gold snapping in the high-altitude wind. It was silent. Massive. Imposing.

The lift shuddered to a halt. The latches engaged with a heavy, final _ka-thunk._

The gate slid open.

"Move!" a voice bellowed. "Out! Now! Move it, scum!"

Wardens. A dozen of them. Unlike the spotless ceremonial guard who had taken Leo, these ones wore matte-gray tactical armor. It was scratched, dented, and purposeful. They held shock-batons that crackled with blue electricity, the arcs snapping loudly in the thin air.

The candidates stumbled out, blinking, shivering, terrifyingly vulnerable. They spilled onto the platform—a pristine, white marble courtyard suspended five thousand feet in the air.

The wind hit them instantly. It wasn't the stagnant draft of the tunnels. It was a living force, a gale that tore at their clothes and threatened to push them over the edge. And there were no rails. Just a sheer, vertigo-inducing drop into the clouds below.

A man near the front—a skinny kid with a shaved head—stumbled, sliding on the smooth marble. He skidded toward the edge. He screamed, scrabbling at the polished stone, his fingers finding no purchase.

He stopped inches from the drop. He stared down, his face a mask of absolute terror.

A Warden laughed. It was a harsh, metallic sound through his helmet's vocoder. "Watch your step, filth. Gravity works up here too."

Angelica walked out. She kept her head down, her body hunched against the wind, but her eyes were darting everywhere. Scanning. Mapping.

_Exits: Two. One heavily guarded by four Wardens with plasma rifles. One leads back to the lift. No escape._
_Perimeter: Open. Lethal drop. Wind speed: 45 knots. Gusting to 60._
_Hostiles: Twelve Wardens. Armed. Tactic-grade armor. Lethal._
_Environment: High exposure. Bright light. Slippery floor._

They were herded into a holding pen—a secondary cage built in the center of the courtyard. It was elegant, of course. Zenith cages were always works of art. The bars were made of some translucent, singing crystal that vibrated with a low hum.

Angelica reached out a hand, hovering it near the crystal.

_Hummm._

The hairs on her arm stood up. _Kinetic Barrier. Touch it, and it boils your blood._

She moved to the back corner. She found a spot where the shadow of a pillar offered a sliver of relief from the sun. She slid down the wall, crouching, trying to stop the world from spinning.

She pulled her datapad from the hidden pocket in the lining of her tunic. she shielded the screen with her body, hunching over it like a miser counting coins.

Her thumb hovered over the power button. She needed to know. She needed to see what she was up against.

She activated the scanner.

She had coded the app herself. It hijacked the ambient medical sensors embedded in the Academy's walls—the ones designed to monitor student health—and fed the raw telemetry to her pad. It was a passive hack, invisible to the security grid.

The screen scrolled with data. A waterfall of misery.

_Target 1: Male. 220 lbs. Heart Rate: 110 bpm. Elevated cortisol. Adrenaline spike._
_Target 2: Female. 140 lbs. Resting tremor in left hand. Implant rejection symptoms._
_Target 3: Male. 180 lbs. Breathing irregular. Pneumonia._

She looked up, matching the data to the faces.

To her left, a man was sharpening his teeth with a small file he had smuggled in. His mouth was a ruin of bleeding gums and pointed ivory. _Subject 12: 'The Vampire'. Gang affiliation: Bleeders. Severe calcium deficiency. Bone density: 60%. If I hit him in the jaw, it shatters._

To her right, a young boy—barely sixteen—was rocking back and forth, clutching prayer beads made of spark plugs. He was crying silently. _Subject 19: Panic attack. Hyperventilating. He’s going to pass out in five minutes._

Across the circle, a group of three women were already forming a pack. They stood back-to-back, eyeing the others with predatory intent. _Subjects 22, 23, 24. Coordinated. Dangerous. Pack tactics._

They looked like monsters. Big, mean, scarred. But the data told the truth. They were sick. They were starving. They were terrified.

A shadow fell over her.

Angelica stiffened. She didn't look up. She saw the boots first. Heavy, steel-toed combat boots, size 14. Standard issue for the heavy labor gangs in the foundries. They were caked with dried mud and fresh blood.

"You're in my spot," a voice grumbled. It sounded like gravel in a blender.

Angelica slowly tilted her head up.

He was a mountain. At least seven feet tall. His arms were as thick as her waist, corded with muscle that looked unnatural—chemically enhanced. A tattoo of a gear-tooth cog encircled his left eye—the mark of the Gear-Grinders, a notorious gang from Level 11 known for crushing their enemies in hydraulic presses.

Jax. She recognized him from the wanted bulletins. Kill count in the double digits.

"Did you hear me, Runt?" Jax growled, looming over her. "I said move."

The old Angelica—the thief, the rat—would have scrambled. She would have apologized, scurried away, and found a smaller hole to hide in.

But the old Angelica was gone. She had died in the crawlspace when she did the math on Leo's life.

This Angelica didn't move.

She looked at him. Really looked at him. Not at his face, but at the data hovering in her mind's eye.

_Subject: Jax._
_Height: 7'1"._
_Weight: 285 lbs._
_Injury: Right knee. Meniscus tear. Chronic inflammation. See that swelling? He can't pivot._
_Blood Chemistry: High levels of necrotic stimulant. Withdrawal imminent._
_Heart Rate: 95 bpm. Irregular._

He wasn't a monster. He was a leaking hydraulic system. He was a machine with a bad seal.

"You're blocking the light," Angelica said. Her voice was quiet, flat, bored.

Jax blinked. He hadn't expected that. He had expected fear. He fed on fear. Absence of fear confused him. He leaned down, placing a massive hand on the wall next to her head.

"You got a mouth on you, little bit," he sneered. "I like that. Maybe you can be my mascot. Carry my gear. Shine my boots. Keep the other rats away."

He grinned, revealing a mouth full of gold teeth.

"What do you say? Join Team Jax. Survival rate goes up if you're with me."

Angelica looked at his knee again. "Pass."

The grin vanished.

"Pass?" Jax roared. He grabbed her by the collar of her tunic and hauled her to her feet. She dangled there, her toes barely touching the ground. "You don't get to pass, trash! I'm giving you a chance. You think you can survive this alone? Look at you! I could snap you like a toothpick!"

Angelica didn't flinch. She watched his pupils. They were pinned. Dilated. Oscillating.

_Stimulant crash in 3... 2..._

He twitched. A small, involuntary spasm in his cheek. His grip on her collar trembled.

"You should sit down," Angelica observed clinically, staring straight into his bloodshot eye. "Your right knee is buckling. The structural integrity is compromised. If you shift your weight too fast, the lateral ligament will snap. And then you'll be on the floor. And the Bleeders over there?"

She nodded toward the guy with the filed teeth.

"They'll eat you alive."

Jax froze. His eyes narrowed. "How do you..."

He shifted his weight. A sharp wince of pain crossed his face. He grunted, stumbling back half a step, dropping her.

Angelica landed on her feet and smoothed her tunic. "Energy conservation is recommended. You're going to need it."

Jax stared at her. He looked at his knee. He looked back at her. The confusion turned to rage, but it was a hesitant rage. He didn't understand what she was. She wasn't fighting him. She was... analyzing him. It spooked him. It was sorcery.

"Freak," he muttered, spitting on the floor near her boot. He turned and lumbered away, shoulder-checking a smaller candidate just to regain his sense of dominance.

Angelica let out a breath she had been holding. Her hands were shaking. Not from fear, but from the adrenaline dump. She pressed her back against the cool crystal bars, feeling the hum of the barrier.

She looked back at her screen.

_Subject 12... Subject 15..._

She stopped scrolling.

_Subject 4._

_Female. 5'6". 120 lbs._
_Heart Rate: 45 bpm._
_Cortisol: Low. Baseline._
_Motion: Minimal._

Angelica looked up. She scanned the cage.

In the far corner, sitting in the lotus position, was a girl. She had pale skin and shaved white hair. She wore simple gray rags, but they were clean. She wasn't pacing. She wasn't looking at the view. She wasn't fighting for space.

She was weaving a piece of string between her fingers, creating complex, geometric patterns. Cat's cradle.

_Over. Under. Pull. Twist._

Her movements were fluid, precise, and hypnotic.

Everyone else in the cage was vibrating with panic or aggression. Subject 4 was... still. She was an island of calm in a sea of noise.

_Threat Level: Extreme._
_Assessment: Professional._

Angelica marked her. _Watch that one. She’s not here to survive. She’s here to win._

She looked around at the spires again. The white clean lines. The sterile perfection.

She understood now. She understood why Vane had brought them here.

The Selection wasn't a brawl. It wasn't a Gladiatorial pit where the strongest brute won. If they wanted muscle, they had the Wardens. If they wanted killers, they had drones.

This was a filter.

They were looking for something else.

She looked at her own hands. Small. Scarred. Delicate. She couldn't lift a boulder. She couldn't punch through armor. She couldn't outrun a bolt of plasma.

By all physical metrics, she was the weakest thing in this cage.

She closed her hand into a fist.

_They think strength is about how much you can lift,_ she thought, the words whispering in her mind like a mantra. _They think it's about force. About mass. About how loud you can yell._

She looked at the massive magnetic generator humming silently in the center of the courtyard, holding the platform aloft.

_And I can break everything._

A rhythmic, frantic clicking nearby pulled her from the internal monologue. It wasn’t the hum of the engine or the screech of the rails; it was the sound of wood on wood.

She turned her head slightly. Pressed against her shoulder in the crush of the loading cage was a boy who couldn't have been more than fourteen. His face was a map of soot and tear trails, his eyes clamped shut as he whispered a frantic, silent prayer.

Angelica looked at the prayer beads clicking in his trembling hands.

"Hey," she said softly.

The kid jumped, his eyes wide and wet. "Please... don't hurt me. I didn't want to come here. They took me from the soup kitchen..."

"Stop crying," Angelica commanded, but her voice wasn't harsh. It was factual. "Tears blur your vision. You need to see."

She pointed to the floor. "The rivets. See how they're spaced? That seam there is wider than the others. It's a pivot point."

The kid blinked, wiping his nose on his sleeve. "What?"

"This isn't a cage," she whispered, leaning closer so Jax wouldn't hear. "It's a funnel. When the floor moves, don't fight gravity. Ride it. Aim for the center."

He stared at her, not understanding the physics, but latching onto the certainty in her voice. " Ride it?"

"Center of gravity low. Knees bent. Don't grab the bars; the kinetic field will fry your nerves. Grab the floor grate."

She didn't know why she was telling him. Maybe it was because he reminded her of Leo. Scared. Soft. Out of place. Or maybe it was just efficiency. If he panicked, he might grab her leg and drag her down. Saving him might be necessary to save herself.

"Make yourself heavy," she finished, turning back to her corner. "And don't look down."

The kid nodded, clutching his spark-plug prayer beads tighter. "Okay. Okay. Center. Low. Don't look down."

It wouldn't save him. Not in the long run. But it might buy him five more minutes of life. And in the Silt, five minutes was a lifetime.

A chime sounded. Three clean, bell-like notes that echoed across the courtyard., silencing the wind.

The candidates froze.

The air in the center of the cage simmered. Particles of light gathered, swirling, knitting together.

A hologram materialized.

It started as a swirl of blue photons in the center of the cage, coalescing into a shape that was larger than life. It towered over them, twenty feet tall, shimmering with high-definition clarity.

It was Prelate Vane.

He looked godlike. His robes—white and gold, pristine—rippled in a digital wind that wasn't blowing. His face was serene, benevolent, and utterly terrifying in its perfection. His eyes, magnified to the size of dinner plates, swept over the cage with a gaze that felt like a physical weight.

His voice boomed from hidden speakers, surrounding them. It wasn't just loud; it resonated in their chests, vibrating their ribcages.

"Welcome, Candidates."

The sound was so clear it felt like he was speaking inside their heads. The feedback loop of the speakers created a slight, deliberate echo—the Voice of God effect.

"You stand at the threshold of the Zenith," Vane intoned, his hands clasped behind his back. "Below you lies the Silt—the past. The mud from which you crawled. The darkness that bred you."

He gestured upward, and the hologram mimicked the movement, pointing a giant hand toward the Spire above.

"Above you lies the Spire—the future. The light. The order."

The candidates were frozen. Some were staring up with slack-jawed awe, terrified by the sheer scale of him. Others, like Jax, were sneering, but even Jax looked small next to the projection.

"You have been chosen from the refuse of the world," Vane continued, his voice dropping an octave, becoming intimate, dangerous. "Not because you are special. But because somewhere, amidst the noise of your flawed genetics, there _might_ be a signal. A potential."

He walked through the crowd. The hologram passed through the bodies of the candidates, the blue light washing over them like a scanner.

"But potential is nothing without pressure. Carbon requires heat to become diamond. Iron requires fire to become steel. And the human soul... the human soul requires terror to become worthy."

He paused in the center of the cage, looking down at them like a scientist examining a bacteria culture.

"The Selection is not a school. Do disabuse yourselves of that notion immediately. We are not here to teach you. We are not here to hold your hand. We are here to burn away everything that is not necessary."

He leaned forward, the hologram looming over them.

"Look to your left," he commanded.

The command was hypnotic. Instinctively, almost everyone turned. Angelica didn't. She kept her eyes on Vane, her mind racing. _He’s priming them. He’s creating the 'Us vs. Them' dynamic before the test even starts._

"Look to your right," Vane said softly.

"One of those people will be dead by sunset."

A gasp rippled through the cage. It was a collective intake of breath, sucked from the thin air. The panic, which had been simmering, suddenly boiled over.

"No..." someone whimpered. "They said... they said it was a job interview..."

"Forty of you will be gone by tomorrow," Vane continued, his voice devoid of pity. "If you survive, you are worthy. If you burn... you were fuel. Necessary fuel for the fires of progress."

He straightened up.

"The rules are simple. Survive. Adapt. Ascend. There are no other laws here. Kill or be killed. Think or die."

The hologram began to fade, dissolving back into pixels.

"Begin."

The light vanished.

For a heartbeat, there was silence. The wind howled through the bars. The candidates stared at each other, the trust evaporating, replaced by suspicion.

Then, a mechanical _CLUNK._

It came from beneath their feet. A heavy, industrial sound of latches disengaging.

The floor of the cage dropped.

Not all of it.

A ring of flooring, five feet wide along the outer perimeter of the cage, simply retracted. It snapped back into the wall with violent speed.

Three candidates—the ones who had been leaning against the outer bars, trying to stay as far away from the others as possible—didn't even have time to scream.

One second they were there. The next, they were gone.

They fell.

Angelica saw one of them—a woman with bright blue hair—flail her arms, grabbing at the air. Her eyes met Angelica's for a split second. Pure, unadulterated horror.

Then she vanished into the clouds below. A localized scream that faded rapidly into the wind.

_Doppler effect,_ Angelica thought numbly. _Velocity equals gravity times time squared._

Silence. Absolute, horrified silence in the cage.

Then, the remaining section of the floor—the center disc—began to tilt.

---

High above the courtyard, in a room that smelled of antiseptic, ozone, and cold coffee, Dr. Aris watched the wall of screens.

He sat in his floating chair—a customized anti-grav harness that supported his atrophied legs. He spun slowly, his cybernetic eye whirring softly as it cycled through spectrums.

He was the Sleepless Eye. The Head of Academy Research. The man who designed the tests.

He watched the feed from the Holding Pen. He watched the candidates scrambling for the center as the floor tilted. He watched the panic. The shoving. The screaming.

"Cortisol levels spiking across the board," he muttered into his recorder, his voice bored. "Group panic response initiated. Predictable. Disappointing."

He swiped a hand through the holographic interface, dismissing the biometrics of the brutes. He saw heart rates hitting 180. He saw uncontrollable tremors. He saw the 'Vampire' biting the shoulder of another candidate in a frenzy to hold on.

"Animals," Aris sighed. "Just animals reacting to a stimulus. Where is the intellect? Where is the adaptation?"

He zoomed in on a specific feed.

_Subject: Ward, Angelica. ID: Null._

She wasn't screaming. She wasn't shoving.

She was crouching near the center pivot point of the floor—the only place where the tilt was minimal. She had found a grate in the floor plating. Her small fingers were locked into it.

And she was... counting?

His sensors picked up the subtle movement of her lips.

_Angle of inclination increasing... 15 degrees... 20 degrees... Hydraulic limit approaching..._

Aris paused the feed. He rewound it. He zoomed in on her eyes.

They weren't the eyes of a victim. They were the eyes of an engineer looking at a broken engine. Her pupils weren't dilated with fear; they were focused. She was tracking the mechanism of the trap. She wasn't reacting to the danger; she was analyzing the machine that was creating the danger.

"Fascinating," Aris whispered.

He loved anomalies. In a city of clones, genetic perfection, and conformists, anomalies were the only thing that made the insomnia bearable.

He pulled up her file.

_Name: Angelica Ward._
_Origin: Sector 12 (Silt)._
_Parentage: Unknown/Deceased._
_Education: None._
_Combat Training: None._

"A blank slate," he mused. "A zero."

And yet, her stress metrics were flat. Her heart rate was elevated—110 bpm—but steady. No arrhythmia. No panic spikes. She was surfing the chaos.

He glanced at another screen. _Subject 4 (White Hair)._ That one was calm too. But her calm was different. It was the calm of a predator waiting to strike. Subject 4 had a knife hidden in her boot—Aris had seen it on the X-ray, but allowed it because initiative was a trait to be encouraged.

But Ward? Ward had no knife. She had a datapad.

"She's hacking the medical sensors," Aris realized, seeing a blip on his network monitor. "She's... she's scanning the competition."

He laughed. A dry, rasping sound.

"Bold. Very bold."

He tapped a key on his console.

_Note: Subject Ward exhibits atypical cognitive adaptation under varying stress loads. Unlike other subjects who revert to fight-or-flight, Subject Ward engages in analyze-and-exploit. Prioritize observation. Recommend baseline neural mapping._

"Let's see what you do when the math gets harder, little rat," Aris said, leaning back in his chair. "Let's see if you break, or if you calculate the tensile strength of your own bones."

He unpaused the feed.

On the screen, the floor tilted to forty-five degrees.

People began to slide. The 'Vampire' lost his grip. He slid, claws scratching uselessly on the marble, towards the abyss.

Angelica didn't slide. She had already calculated the friction coefficient. She had wedged her boot into a seam in the plating before the tilt began.

She held on. And for a second, Aris thought she looked up. Straight at the hidden camera. Straight at him.

He smiled, his cybernetic eye glowing red.

"Begin," he echoed.

He leaned forward, his eyes drinking in the data.

He watched for ten minutes. He watched as the floor tilted to fifty, then sixty degrees. He watched as gravity did exactly what it was designed to do: weed out the weak. He watched twenty candidates lose their grip, their screams swallowed by the wind as they slid into the abyss of the Silt below.

The 'Vampire' managed to dig his claws into the grate of a drain, holding on with a desperate, animalistic strength. Jax used his immense bulk to wedge himself between two rising floor plates.

And Ward... Ward just hung there, perfectly balanced, riding the tilt like she was part of the machine.

Finally, a chime sounded. The floor slammed back to horizontal with a bone-jarring thud.

The survivors lay on the white marble, gasping, shaking, traumatized.

"Fifty remain," Aris noted, checking the tally. "Acceptable attrition."

On the screen, the Wardens moved in. They didn't give the candidates time to recover. Electric prods sparked. Orders were barked. The herd was moving again.

"Get up! Move! To the Spire!"

Aris watched as they were shoved toward the narrow walkway that led to the Induction Tower. He swiped his hand through the air, dismissing the current feed and bringing up a new one.

_Camera 4: The Span._

It was a mile-long ribbon of glass over the void.

"Now," Aris whispered, his finger hovering over the wind-control interface. "Let's see if they can walk."
