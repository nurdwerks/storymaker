# Character Profile: Lady Selene

**Archetype:** The Perfectionist Sycophant / The Sculptor
**True Sin:** ENVY (She hates anything natural or uncontrolled, including Lilith's own daughters).
**Virtue Mask:** DEVOTION (She frames her control as "Refining the Bloodline").

## I. Role in the Story

Lady Selene is Matriarch Lilith Night’s chief administrator and aesthetician. She is responsible for maintaining the "Night Look" and the rigid standards of the Matriarchy.

- **The Interaction:** She views Angelica as a "failed experiment," a biological error that needs to be corrected or discarded.
- **The Control:** She fusses over Kaelen's appearance, adjusting his collars and smoothing his hair in a way that signals his "ownership" by the family, and Angelica's exclusion from his life.

## II. Book 3 Integration: The Unmaking

- **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 13 (Nightfall).
- **The Scene:** Scene 2: The Unmasking.
- **The Event:** During the seizure of the estate, Selene is caught by Grey's drones. A biological scan reveals she has been embezzling family funds to buy black-market "Youth-Grafts."
- **The Fate:** The droids strip the grafts from her face, literally peeling away her beauty. She is revealed as a withered, desperate old woman. Kaelen watches this, realizing the "Night Standard" was always a lie.
- **Status:** **Ruined.** She is dragged away by the Wardens for "Bio-Fraud."

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 13 | Detailed Description | They move through the halls, tagging paintings, statues, and furniture with digital "Seized" markers. They enter the private quarters of Lady Selene, Kaelen's aunt. Selene screams as two medical droids restrain her. She has been maintaining her youth with illegal "Youth-Grafts"—synthetic skin and muscle enhancements. The droids forcibly remove the grafts, peeling away the illusion of beauty to reveal the aged, withered woman underneath. It is a brutal, clinical stripping of dignity. |
