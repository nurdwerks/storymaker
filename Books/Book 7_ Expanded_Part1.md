### Chapter 5: The Obstacle

The corridor leading to the Engine Room was not just a hallway; it was a grand, grotesquely organic nave, a cathedral dedicated to the worship of bone and violet light. The ceiling arched high overhead, supported by ribs of chitin that curved down to meet the floor. The walls pulsed with a bioluminescent rhythm, the ship's heartbeat echoing in the silence. At the far end, five hundred meters away, stood the massive blast doors of the reactor core, sealed tight.

And standing directly in their path, blocking the only way forward, was a **Centurion**.

It was a nightmare made real, a creature designed by an intellect that viewed elegance and lethality as the same virtue. It stood ten feet tall, towering over them like a statue of a forgotten, angry god. It had four arms, arranged symmetrically on its torso. Each hand gripped a long, curved glaive made of some dark alloy that crackled with arcs of unstable energy. Its armor was thick, iridescent plate that shifted color from oil-slick black to a deep, bruised purple as it moved. It didn't have a face—no eyes, no mouth. Just a smooth, black visor that curved across the front of its helmet, reflecting their terrified expressions back at them in distorted miniature.

It stood perfectly still, not breathing, not twitching. It waited.

"That's a big bug," Zephyr whispered, stepping back involuntarily. The coin in his hand was slippery with sweat. "I don't think I have enough credits to kill that. Can we negotiate? Maybe it takes bribes?"

The Centurion roared—a sound that wasn't vocal but digital, a screech of binary static that overloaded their audio dampeners and made their teeth ache in their skulls. It was a war cry transmitted on every frequency at once.

Then, it charged.

For something so massive, it moved with terrifying speed. It didn't run; it blurred. One moment it was fifty meters away, the next it was on top of them.

"Scatter!" Angelica yelled, throwing herself to the right.

The first glaive slashed the air where she had been standing a microsecond before. The tip of the energy blade touched the floor, and the deck plating instantly melted into glowing slag. The heat was intense, singing the leather of her coat.

Zephyr didn't run. He raised his golden arm and fired. *THOOM.* A bolt of plasma the size of a melon slammed into the Centurion's chest.

It should have blown a hole through the alien. Instead, the energy dissipated harmlessly against a shimmering, hexagonal barrier that flared into existence just millimeters from the armor.

"Shields!" Zephyr shouted, panic rising in his voice. "I can't punch through! It's too thick! It's like shooting a wall!"

Ria didn't care about shields. She was a Titan. She roared and charged the Centurion, her metal skin gleaming under the violet lights. She lowered her shoulder and slammed into the creature's leg, intending to shatter the knee joint.

It was like hitting a mountain. The Centurion didn't even wobble. It looked down at her, almost casually, and backhanded her with one of its lower arms. The blow was so fast it was invisible. Ria flew across the room, smashing into a chitinous pillar with a sickening crunch of metal and bone. She slumped to the floor, dazed, her helmet cracked.

"Ria!" Angelica screamed. She raised her pistol and fired a rapid burst at the creature's head. The bullets sparked off the energy shield, useless as hail against a tank.

The Centurion turned its attention to Kaelen. It stepped over Ria's prone form, raising two of its glaives for a killing strike.

Kaelen stepped forward. He held his sword in a high guard, the ancient steel humming with resonance. He looked absurdly small against the monster, a child with a toothpick facing a dragon. But his hands were steady.

"Go," he said to Angelica, his voice calm, almost detached. He didn't look back at her. "Get to the door. Plant the charge. I'll hold it."

"Kaelen, you can't fight that thing alone," Angelica argued, scrambling to her feet. "It will kill you in seconds!"

"I'm not alone," Kaelen said.

He closed his eyes. Under his feet, the shadows began to move. They didn't behave like normal shadows, stretching away from the light sources. Instead, they pooled around his boots, thick, oily, and unnatural. They bubbled like tar.

The temperature in the room plummeted. Frost formed on the organic walls. The violet lights of the ship dimmed, as if the darkness was sucking the power out of the air.

The Centurion lunged. Kaelen parried.

*CLANG-HISS.*

Sparks flew as steel met energy. The force of the blow drove Kaelen to one knee, cracking the floor beneath him. He gritted his teeth, holding the block. The Centurion's second glaive came down in a killing arc aimed at his neck.

Kaelen rolled. The blade missed him by an inch, singing the hair on his arm. He scrambled up, panting, putting distance between himself and the monster.

"Now!" he screamed.

The pool of shadow at his feet exploded upwards. **Umbra**, the Shadow-Beast, detached itself from the floor. It rose up behind the Centurion, a towering silhouette of absolute darkness. It had no defined features, no face, no skin. It was a void in the shape of a wolf-man, with claws made of pure negation. It was a monster made of Kaelen's grief, his repressed rage, and his noble duty, all twisted into a weapon.

The Centurion sensed it. The alien spun around, swinging two of its arms at the shadow in a panic. The energy blades passed harmlessly through the darkness. You cannot cut a shadow. You cannot kill a void.

Umbra didn't strike the armor. It didn't try to break the shield. It attacked the only vulnerable point: the senses.

The shadow poured itself onto the Centurion's helmet. It was like living ink. It covered the visor, blinding the creature. Then, it began to squeeze. It entered through the ventilation slits. It seeped into the neck joints. It invaded the suit.

The alien thrashed. It dropped its weapons, the glaives clattering to the floor. It clawed at its own face with all four hands, trying to rip the darkness off. But there was nothing to grab. Umbra was inside.

A sound echoed from the suit—a gurgling, wet scream that was terrifyingly organic. The alien was drowning in darkness.

Kaelen fell to his knees, clutching his head. Blood began to stream from his nose and ears. The psychic feedback of the bond was overwhelming him. He was feeling what Umbra felt—the cold, the hunger, the kill. He screamed, a sound that harmonized with the dying alien.

"Finish it!" Angelica yelled, though she was frozen in horror.

Inside the suit, Umbra solidified. The shadow turned into physical matter—spikes of solid darkness.

*CRUNCH.*

The sound was wet and heavy. The Centurion stiffened, its four arms locking rigid. Then, slowly, it toppled. It fell forward like a felled tree, hitting the deck with a crash that shook the entire room. Black ooze, mixed with the alien's blue blood, began to leak from the cracked visor.

Umbra flowed back out of the suit, liquid again. It slithered across the floor and reformed into a simple, harmless shadow attached to Kaelen's heels.

Silence returned to the cathedral of bone.

Kaelen stayed on his knees for a long moment, gasping for air. He wiped the blood from his face with a trembling hand. His skin was pale as death, his eyes wide and shocked. He looked at the massive corpse, then at his own hands, as if he couldn't believe they were responsible for such violence.

"Size doesn't matter," Kaelen wheezed, forcing himself to stand. He sheathed his sword with a shaky *snick*. "When you fight with darkness."

He swayed, almost falling, but Angelica caught him. She felt the chill radiating off him; he felt like a corpse.

"You're freezing," she whispered.

"I'm fine," Kaelen lied. He looked at the blast doors. "The door... it's clear."

Angelica nodded. She ran to Ria, who was pulling herself up against a pillar. The Titan's armor was dented, and she walked with a limp, but she gave a thumbs up.

"Did we win?" Ria asked, her voice slurred from the concussion.

"Kaelen won," Angelica said. "Come on. Let's finish this before any more of them show up."

They stepped over the twitching corpse of the Centurion, careful not to touch the leaking blood. They approached the massive Engine Room doors. Angelica pulled a breaching charge from her vest—a disk of high-explosive polymer. She slapped it onto the locking mechanism.

"Fire in the hole!"

*Click. Boom.*

The lock shattered. The blast doors groaned, their internal mechanisms failing. Slowly, heavily, they slid open, revealing the blinding, chaotic violet light of the Core within. The sound of the singularity screaming filled their ears. They had reached the heart of the enemy.
