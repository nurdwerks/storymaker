  - _Key Dialog:_ **AI:** "Structural integrity at 10%. Spine fracturing."

- **Key Event:** Vane's voice from the trash server warns that the ship is about to snap and that they will be scattered across dimensions if the portal closes now.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Vane** — Displays a desperate, survival-at-all-costs attitude even while trapped in a loop, providing critical technical warnings.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "You need more torque! Or the ship will snap in half!"
