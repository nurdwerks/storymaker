## Chapter 18: The Plague

### Scene 1: The Sickness

- **Key Event:** The Onset.
- **Detailed Description:** It starts innocuously in the village. A hunter coughs while skinning a deer. Dry. Racking. But within hours, he is on the ground, convulsing.
- **Key Event:** The Spread.
- **Detailed Description:** The fever hits next. High. Delirium-inducing. It moves through the tribe like wildfire, jumping from hut to hut. Within a week, half the workforce is down. The construction on the ship frame grinds to a halt.
- **Key Event:** The Observation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica walks through the sick tents, a makeshift quarantine zone she established near the river. The sound of wheezing fills the humid air. The smell is distinctive—copper and rot.
- **Key Event:** The Diagnosis.
- **Detailed Description:** She kneels beside a child. She checks his vitals. Blue tinge to the lips. Rapid onset pulminary edema. Hemorrhaging in the eyes.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** She recognizes the symptoms from her history books.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's the Delta-Strain. From the pandemic of the 22nd Century. It killed millions."
- **Key Event:** The Horror.
- **Detailed Description:** She stands up, backing away. "It shouldn't exist yet. It won't evolve for another five thousand years."
- **Key Event:** The Source.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at her reflection in a basin of water. Pale. Sweaty.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Me. I brought it. It was dormant in my blood. My immune system is adapted to it; I've been vaccinated since birth. Theirs... theirs is virgin territory."
- **Key Event:** The Guilt.
- **Detailed Description:** The realization crashes over her. She is Patient Zero. She is the carrier. The "Sky-Demons" didn't curse them. She did. She came to save them, and she is killing them with a hug.

### Scene 2: The Cure

- **Key Event:** The Crisis.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar is dying. The massive Alpha lies on his furs, shivering uncontrollably. His mighty strength is gone, leaving him looking small and frail.
- **Key Event:** The Plea.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin grabs Angelica's arm.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Save him. If he dies, the tribe scatters. The labor force vanishes. The mission ends."
- **Key Event:** The Lab.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica runs to her cave lab. She tears through her med-kits. Empty. She used the last of the broad-spectrum antibiotics on a broken leg last month.
- **Key Event:** The Problem.
- **Detailed Description:** She needs a specific antibiotic to fight the secondary bacterial pneumonia that is actually killing them. But she is five thousand years too early for a pharmacy.
- **Key Event:** The Discovery.
- **Detailed Description:** She knocks over a stack of old food trays in her frustration. A loaf of bread, forgotten in the damp corner of the cave, rolls out. It is covered in green fuzz.
- **Key Event:** The Identification.
- **Detailed Description:** She stares at it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Mold."
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Penicillium notatum. The original.
- **Key Event:** The Process.
- **Detailed Description:** She grabs the bread. She works feverishly, ignoring her own exhaustion. She scrapes the mold into a sterile dish. She mixes it with distilled water. She filters it through her own silk undershirt.
- **Key Event:** The Science.
- **Detailed Description:** It is crude. It is dirty. It violates every safety protocol of the 24th Century. But it is science.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Thank you, Fleming. I am cheating death with a sandwich crust."

### Scene 3: The Result

- **Key Event:** The Injection.
- **Detailed Description:** She rushes back to Ragnar's tent. The Old Seer is there, shaking a bone rattle over the dying chief and chanting about evil spirits.
- **Key Event:** The Confrontation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica pushes past him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Get out. Your magic isn't working."
- **Key Event:** The Procedure.
- **Detailed Description:** She finds a vein in Ragnar's arm, which is difficult due to dehydration. She uses a hollow reed fitted with a sharpened fish bone as a needle—a terrifyingly primitive syringe.
- **Key Event:** The Dose.
- **Detailed Description:** She injects the cloudy, greenish fluid.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Die or live. Just don't stay sick. Fight it, you stubborn ox."
- **Key Event:** The Wait.
- **Detailed Description:** She sits by his side. Torin stands guard at the door. Hours pass. The only sound is Ragnar's ragged breathing.
- **Key Event:** The Turn.
- **Detailed Description:** Suddenly, Ragnar gasps. His back arches. Then, he collapses back onto the furs. His breathing deepens. It slows. It evens out. The sweat breaks on his forehead.
- **Key Event:** The Awakening.
- **Detailed Description:** He opens his eyes. They are clear.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "I am hungry."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Laughing hysterically) "He's hungry. Get this man a steak."

### Scene 4: The Witch

- **Key Event:** The News.
- **Detailed Description:** News spreads instantly. The Sky-Witch cured the Alpha. The "Green Water" is magic.
- **Key Event:** The Demand.
- **Detailed Description:** Lines form outside her lab cave. Mothers carrying babies. Warriors carried by their brothers.
- **Key Event:** The Production.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica turns the cave into a factory. She recruits Torin and the healthier children to scrape mold, mix solution, and fill gourds.
- **Key Event:** The Worship.
- **Detailed Description:** As she walks through the village, administering the cure, people fall to their knees. They try to kiss her boots. They touch the hem of her flight suit.
- **Key Event:** The Denial.
- **Detailed Description:** She recoils.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Stop it! Stand up! I'm not a god! I'm just a biologist!"
- **Key Event:** The Lesson.
- **Detailed Description:** She holds up a piece of moldy bread to the crowd.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't worship me. Worship the fungus. This is life. It eats death. I am fighting the plague with a sandwich crust!"
- **Key Event:** The Misunderstanding.
- **Detailed Description:** They stare at her with awe. They don't understand spores or bacteria. They see her commanding rot to heal. They see a miracle. To them, she is the Goddess of decay and rebirth.

### Scene 5: The Exposed Prophet

- **Key Event:** The Meeting.
- **Detailed Description:** Three days later. Ragnar stands before the gathered tribe in the village square. He is weak, leaning on a spear, but he is standing.
- **Key Event:** The Accusation.
- **Detailed Description:** He points a shaking finger at the Old Seer, who stands apart, glaring.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "You rattled bones while my people died. You sang songs while my children burned."
- **Key Event:** The Search.
- **Detailed Description:** He motions to his warriors.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Search his hut."
- **Key Event:** The Hoard.
- **Detailed Description:** The warriors drag out sacks of grain. Dried meat. Fresh water skins. Hoarded while the tribe starved and sickened.
- **Key Event:** The Anger.
- **Detailed Description:** The tribe roars in collective anger. Stones are picked up.
- **Key Event:** The Judgment.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar raises his hand for silence.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "He fed himself on your fear. He grew fat on your graves."
- **Key Event:** The Contrast.
- **Detailed Description:** He points to Angelica, who stands in the back, arms crossed.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "She fed us with her wisdom. She gave us her own blood." (A misunderstanding of the injection, but effective).
- **Key Event:** The Banishment.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar points to the dense jungle.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Go. Take your bones. If the spirits truly love you, they will feed you. But you will not eat with us again."
- **Key Event:** The Exit.
- **Detailed Description:** The Seer is dragged away, screaming curses at the Sky-Witch.
- **Key Event:** The Oath.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar turns to Angelica. He bows. Low. The rest of the tribe follows, a wave of submission.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "The Old Ways are dead. We follow the New Way. We follow the Architect."
- **Key Event:** The Consequence.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica shivers. She has won their absolute loyalty. The ship will be built. But she has also destroyed their culture, exiled their spiritual leader, and installed herself as a deity.
- **Key Event:** The Thought.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the bowing crowd.
  - _Internal Monologue (Angelica):_ I saved their bodies. I think I just stole their souls. The price of progress is always innocence.
