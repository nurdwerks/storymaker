# Chapter 14: Zephyr's Poverty

---

### Scene 1: The Arm / Medical Bay Ruins

- **Key Event:** The ceiling of the Medical Bay groans, a sound like terrible indigestion, before it gives way. A support beam, thick as a tree trunk and heavy with concrete, crashes down.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr is fast—he's always been fast—but he zigged when he should have zagged. He dives, but his left arm, his golden "Masterpiece," gets caught under the tonnage.
- **Key Event:** There is a crunch. Not of bone, but of expensive, lattice-work brass and high-end servos. The sound is heartbreakingly expensive.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr screams. It isn't pain, not yet. It's the Phantom Wallet pain. He feels his net worth plummeting to zero.
- **Key Event:** Ria rushes over, heaving against the beam with her own cybernetics, her servos whining in protest. She lifts it just enough.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr pulls his arm free. Or what's left of it. Below the elbow, the "Masterpiece" is a pancake of twisted gears and sparking wires. The gold plating is stripped away, revealing the grey, industrial steel beneath.
- **Key Event:** They find a working auto-doc station, but it's low on power and missing the "Prosthetic Repair" module. It only has "Emergency Amputation" and "Industrial Attachment" protocols.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr sits in the chair. He looks at his ruined hand. It refuses to close. The fingers hang limp, mocking him.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Zephyr):** He remembers buying that arm. It cost him three jobs and a betrayal. It was his status symbol. It marked him as "The Rogue," not "The Rat." Now, it's just scrap. Without his credits, without his flash, who is he? Just a cripple in a coat that's too big.
- **Key Event:** The auto-doc hums to life. Laser cutters spin up. Zephyr watches, unblinking. He won't look away. He owes it that much respect.
- **Key Event:** The procedure is brutal and efficient. The ruined forearm is severed. The new attachment is welded on. It isn't a hand. It's a heavy, iron utility hook, scavenged from a cargo-loader bot.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr lifts his new arm. It's heavy. Clunky. Ugly. It clashes with his rings.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He looks at his reflection in the dark monitor. He faces the loss with dark humor, refusing to show weakness or grief, because in the Undercity, grief is blood in the water.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Well. Guess I'm a pirate now. Does this come with a parrot, or do I have to steal one?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're taking this well. Most people would be in shock."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "It's just an arm, sweetheart. I've got another one. Sort of. Besides, hooks are in this season. Very brutalist chic."

### Scene 2: The Attack / Collapsed Corridor

- **Key Event:** They move through the corridors of Sector 4. The air is thick with dust and the copper-taste of old blood. The emergency lights flicker, strobing the hallway in disorienting flashes of red and black.
- **Key Event:** A "Clicker" Viral drops from a vent. It’s a twisted thing, human once, now all elbows and teeth, its skin grey and stretched tight over mutated bone.
- **Key Event:** It lands on Ria's back, knocking her prone. Her heavy gun skitters across the floor. The Viral’s claws scrabble against her armor, finding the seams.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr swings his new hook, but he’s off-balance. The weight is wrong. He misses, the iron clang echoing uselessly against the wall.
- **Key Event:** The Viral raises a claw to strike Ria’s exposed neck.
- **Key Event:** There is a sharp _crack_, followed by a wet _thud_.
- **Key Event:** Lady Corinne stands over the Viral. She is breathing hard. In her hand, she holds a stiletto heel. Not a knife—an actual shoe. A _Chateau Noir_ pump with a four-inch steel-reinforced heel.
- **Key Event:** The heel is buried three inches into the Viral's eye socket. The creature spasms once, then goes limp, sliding off Ria.
- **Key Event:** Corinne stares at the shoe. She is shaking. Her manicure is ruined.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Her aristocratic facade cracks, shattered by the raw, ugly necessity of violence. But beneath the break, there is something harder. Iron, forged in panic.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** _(staring at the heel dripping with black ichor)_ "Those were Chateau Noir. Custom made. Imported from the Sky-Lofts."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** _(rolling over, staring up at her)_ "You just killed a monster with a shoe. I have a plasma cannon, and you used footwear."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "It was a very expensive shoe. It had excellent structural integrity."

### Scene 3: The Bond / Safe Corner

- **Key Event:** They retreat to a "Safe Corner"—a defensible dead-end with a heavy blast door. They barricade it with debris.
- **Key Event:** The adrenaline fades, leaving them cold and tired. Ria sits against the wall, checking her armor seals. Zephyr tries to clean his hook with a rag, but the rust is stubborn.
- **Key Event:** Corinne sits apart from them. She has taken off her other shoe. She is barefoot now, her delicate feet dirty and bleeding on the rough concrete. She holds the bloody shoe in her lap like a dead pet.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Ria):** She watches Corinne. For weeks, she saw the noblewoman as baggage. A calorie-sink. Someone to be protected and resented. But she remembers the sound of the heel punching through bone. That wasn't luck. That was rage.
- **Key Event:** Ria stands up. She limps over to Corinne. She offers her a canteen of water. It's a peace offering.
- **Key Event:** Corinne looks up, surprised. She takes the water, her hands trembling.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She admits that her prejudice blinded her. She sees the survivor hiding under the silk.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I was wrong about you. You've got teeth."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Were you? I'm still useless, Sergeant. I can't weld. I can't shoot. I just have good shoes. And now I only have one."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You saved my life. In my book, that makes you useful enough."

### Scene 4: The March / Forward

- **Key Event:** They pack up to move. The safe zone isn't safe forever. They have to reach the lower levels before the "Stone Season" freezes the upper sectors solid.
- **Key Event:** Corinne rips a strip of fabric from her expensive dress—silk worth more than Zephyr’s life—and wraps her bleeding feet. She stands up, wincing, but doesn't complain.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr watches her. He looks at his hook. He looks at her bare feet.
- **Key Event:** He realizes they are stripped. The "Rogue" and the "Princess" are gone. The masks have been torn off.
- **Key Event:** He offers her his arm—the good one. She takes it.
- **Key Event:** They walk down the dark corridor, a limping, broken parade of three.
- **Key Event:** The shadows stretch long ahead of them. The cold is biting, a physical weight that presses against their lungs.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Look at us. A one-armed thief and a barefoot princess. We look like a bad joke."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "We match. We're both broken toys now."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Yeah. But broken toys have sharper edges."
