## Chapter 16: The Romance

### Scene 1: The Night / Command Hut, The Village

- **Key Event:** It is late. The jungle outside is alive with the sounds of insects. Inside the Command Hut, it is quiet.
- **Key Event:** The table is covered in starcharts made of parchment. Diagrams of the _Aeterna_'s engine.
- **Key Event:** Torin is asleep at the table. His head is resting on his arms. A smudge of ink is on his cheek.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands over him. She watches him breathe.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the man who built a village for her. Who built a ship for her destiny.
- **Key Event:** She feels a tightness in her chest. It isn't fear. It isn't anger.

### Scene 2: The Touch / Command Hut

- **Key Event:** She picks up a fur cloak from the chair.
- **Key Event:** She drapes it over his shoulders.
- **Key Event:** Torin stirs. He blinks, looking up at her. His eyes are soft, unguarded.
- **Key Event:** "Did I fall asleep?" he murmurs.
- **Key Event:** "You've been working for eighteen hours, Torin," Angelica says softly. "Even monuments need rest."
- **Key Event:** Torin reaches out. He touches her hand. His fingers are rough, calloused. Real.
- **Key Event:** "I wanted to finish the fuel schematics," he says. "For you."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at his hand covering hers.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** Everyone else sees the Captain. The Savior. The Warlord. Torin just sees... Angelica. The girl who fell from the sky.
- **Key Event:** She realizes he is the only person who has ever loved her as a human being. Not as a goddess. Not as a possession.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She recognizes Torin as the only person who has ever loved her as a human being rather than a goddess or possession.

### Scene 3: The Kiss / Command Hut

- **Key Event:** Angelica leans down. She brushes the hair from his forehead.
- **Key Event:** "Thank you," she whispers.
- **Key Event:** Torin looks at her. The air changes. The silence becomes heavy, charged.
- **Key Event:** He stands up. He is taller than her. Solid. Warm.
- **Key Event:** "You don't have to thank me," he says. "I'd build the world for you."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at his mouth. She decides to be selfish. Just for one moment. To take something for herself.
- **Key Event:** She kisses him.
- **Key Event:** It isn't desperate. It isn't a goodbye. It is slow. Gentle. Like coming home.
- **Key Event:** Torin pulls her close. His arms are safe. For twenty years, she has been running. Here, she stops.

### Scene 4: The Confession / Command Hut

- **Key Event:** They break the kiss. They rest their foreheads together.
- **Key Event:** "I'm sorry," Angelica says, tears stinging her eyes.
- **Key Event:** "For what?"
- **Key Event:** "For bringing this war to you. For waking up the monsters. You were safe before I came back."
- **Key Event:** Torin shakes his head. "I was safe. But I was asleep. We were all just... waiting to die."
- **Key Event:** He gestures to the starcharts. To the open window where the stars are visible.
- **Key Event:** "Before you, the sky was just a ceiling," he says. "Now, it's a door. You gave me the stars, Angel."
- **Key Event:** Angelica grips his shirt. "I traveled five thousand years to find you," she whispers. "I didn't know it. But I did. You are my destination, Torin."
- **Key Event:** They stand in the dark, holding onto each other. Two small flames against the infinite night.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Before you, the sky was just a ceiling. Now, it's a door."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I traveled five thousand years to find you. ... You are my destination, Torin."
