---

### Scene 1: The Integration

- **Key Event:** Angelica initiates a deep-level neural sync with the ship's Bi-Core to bypass the Mother's manual overrides.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Voluntarily surrenders her individual "ego" to become a node in the ship's network, risking permanent mental fragmentation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm not a passenger anymore. I'm the system. Close the interface."

### Scene 2: The Ghost Path

- **Key Event:** Inside the matrix, Angelica encounters the "Residual Data" of her mother, Elena Ward, which is separate from the malevolent Hive Mind.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elena (Residual):** "The Mother is what I became to survive. You are what I created to forgive. Don't fight her; overwhelm her."

### Scene 3: The Overload

- **Key Event:** Angelica funnels the collective "Suffering Data" of the Undercity—the hunger, the cold, the grief—directly into the Mother's neural pathway.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Realizes that the "Stone Season" was not meant to be weathered through hardness, but through shared empathy.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You wanted us to be stone so we wouldn't feel the void. But the feeling is what makes us human. Taste the famine, Mother. Taste the rust!"

### Scene 4: The Severance

- **Key Event:** The Mother’s consciousness, unable to process the wave of human raw emotion, suffers a logic-bomb collapse and disconnects from the ship's primary drives.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **The Mother** — Lets out a final, electronic scream of recognition before the biological mass enters a dormant, regenerative state.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "I... I remember the sun. I remember... it was warm."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The season is over. Go to sleep."
