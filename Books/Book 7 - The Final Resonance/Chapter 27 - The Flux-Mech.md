## Chapter 27: The Flux-Mech

### Scene 1: The Dogfight

- **Key Event:** Zephyr launches into the void. The Flux-Mech is slow but heavily armored.
- **Key Event:** He uses the asteroids debris as cover, drifting silently towards the Lead Sphere.
- **Key Event:** Midas (his drone) flies interference, drawing fire from the drone swarms.

### Scene 2: The Damage

- **Key Event:** A gravity-beam clips the mech's leg. The hydraulics scream. Zephyr loses 30% power.
- **Key Event:** He feeds his entire bank account balance into the Bond to boost the engines.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Transferring funds. Authorization: Zephyr. Buy me some speed!"

### Scene 3: The Approach

- **Key Event:** He breaches the chaotic perimeter of the Sphere. He is now in "No Man's Land," close enough that the ship's guns can't support him.
