## Chapter 30: The Rush

### Scene 1: The Panic

- **Key Event:** The alarm.
- **Detailed Description:** The siren cuts through the night air of the Hidden Valley. It is a mechanical shriek, a sound programmed to bypass logic and trigger pure reptilian flight response. It is the "Sky-Fall" alarm, a relic from the initial colonization that hasn't been used in generations. Angelica bolts out of the Command Hut, her boots hitting the dirt before her eyes fully adjust to the darkness.

- **Key Event:** The sky.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks up. The atmosphere above the valley protection dome is pulsing with violet light. It is ionization—the telltale signature of massive ships entering the atmosphere at combat speeds.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "They found us! How did they find us? The stealth fields were active!"
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Torin's voice cracks with panic. Angelica misses the steady, cynical drone of **Zephyr** in her comms. The Rogue would have just asked for a vector. Torin is a builder, not a soldier. She has to be the soldier for both of them.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The heat signature from the volcano. When we charged the core, we spiked the thermal output. We lit a beacon in the infrared."

- **Key Event:** The stampede.
- **Detailed Description:** The village wakes up. It is not the organized reveille of a military camp. It is the terrified chaos of a refugee settlement. Doors bang open. People scream. Families run in circles, grabbing useless possessions—chairs, paintings, pots. The panic is contagious. It is a physical wave pushing them toward the ship, threatening to crush anyone who stumbles.

- **Key Event:** The voice.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar, the old war-chief of the ground security, steps onto a supply crate. He is unarmored, holding a plasma rifle. He bellows.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "HOLD!"
  - **Detailed Description:** The sheer volume of his voice—amplified by his chest resonators—stuns the crowd into a momentary silence.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Panic kills more than plasma! If you run, you die! If they breach the perimeter while the cargo doors are open, the ship dies! Warriors! To the wall! We buy them time!"

### Scene 2: The Loading

- **Key Event:** The filter.
- **Detailed Description:** The _Aeterna_ is humming, its ancient engines vibrating the ground. The loading ramp is down, bathed in harsh yellow work-lights. A line of civilians snakes up the ramp. It is moving too slowly. Angelica stands at the top of the ramp, acting as the filter. **Corinne** stands beside her with a datasheet, ruthlessly checking names against the manifest.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Name not found. Step aside. We are at capacity for Sector 4."

- **Key Event:** The dowry.
- **Detailed Description:** A woman tries to drag a heavy wooden chest up the ramp. It is reinforced with iron bands. She is struggling, blocking the line.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Leave it! Maximum carry weight is ten kilos per person!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Woman:** "It's my dowry! Gold! Silver! It's all we have left!"

- **Key Event:** The decision.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica doesn't hesitate. She kicks the chest. It tumbles down the ramp, bursting open at the bottom. Gold coins and silver heirlooms spill into the mud, glinting in the floodlights.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's dead weight! We can't eat gold! We can't breathe silver! Move!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Woman (sobbing):** "You monster!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Move or get out of the line!"

- **Key Event:** The guilt.
- **Detailed Description:** The woman runs up the ramp. Angelica watches the gold disappear into the mud. She hates herself. She feels the bile rise in her throat. But she counts the pounds. Every ounce of fuel they burn lifting gold is an ounce they don't have for maneuvering.

### Scene 3: The Chaos

- **Key Event:** The strike.
- **Detailed Description:** _ZZZTTT-BOOM._ A bolt of green plasma strikes the jungle canopy outside the perimeter wall. Trees explode into steam and splinters. The ground shakes violently. This is orbital bombardment. The Hunter ships are softening the target.

- **Key Event:** The doll.
- **Detailed Description:** In the shaking, a young mother drops her child's hand to pick up a fallen doll. The crowd surges forward, driven by the explosion. They almost trample the child, a boy of no more than five.

- **Key Event:** The intervention.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica vaults the railing of the ramp. She drops ten feet, landing in the mud. She grabs the child just as a boot comes down. She shoves the mother forward, hard.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Leave the doll! Pick up the child! Run!"

- **Key Event:** The skyfall.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks up. The clouds are parting. Metallic shapes are descending through the smoke. They are ugly, angular ships—Drop-ships. The invasion has begun.

### Scene 4: The Command

- **Key Event:** The retreat.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin's voice crackles over the comms.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "They've breached the West Gate! Ragnar is down! We are falling back to the ship! Start the sequence!"

- **Key Event:** The retraction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica scrambles back up the ramp. She hits the retraction control. The massive hydraulic pistons groan. The ramp begins to lift.

- **Key Event:** The strays.
- **Detailed Description:** The last family—a father, mother, and teenage son—is running across the tarmac. They are late. The ramp is already five feet off the ground and rising.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Father:** "It's too high!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Jump! Throw the boy!"

- **Key Event:** The rescue.
- **Detailed Description:** The father throws his son. Angelica catches him by the wrist. She pulls, her muscles straining. He scrambles onto the deck. The father boosts the mother. She claws her way up. The father jumps. He barely catches the edge. Angelica grabs his belt. She hauls him over the lip just as the ramp seals flush with the hull.

- **Key Event:** The seal.
- **Detailed Description:** "Go! Go! Go!" Angelica shouts, hitting the seal button. "Your life is up there! Run!" The inner airlock creates a vacuum seal. The screams of the dying outside—the rearguard, the slow—are cut off instantly. Now, there is only the hum of the ship. And the silence of the survivors.
