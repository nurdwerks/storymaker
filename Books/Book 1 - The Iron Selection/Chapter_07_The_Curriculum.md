## Chapter 7: The Curriculum

### Scene 1: The Lecture

- **Key Event:** The setting of Lecture Hall 1.
- **Detailed Description:** Lecture Hall 1 is a cavernous amphitheater built of polished marble and acoustic stone. It is designed to make the speaker sound like a god and the students feel like insects. The air is cold, conditioned to a sterile dryness. Professor Halloway stands at the podium. He is a relic of the old regime—skin as thin as parchment, milky eyes that see only what they want to see, dressed in the gold-threaded robes of a High Archivist. He taps a cane against the floor for silence.

- **Key Event:** The official history.
- **Detailed Description:** A massive hologram projection fills the air above the students. It depicts the "Founders"—seven glowing figures descending from the stars. Halloway recites the scripture of the Great Ascension. "In the Time of Ash, the Founders descended. They were the Chosen. The Star-Gods touched their blood, granting them the Resonance. They built the Zenith to shelter the worthy."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Professor Halloway:** "Resonance is their gift. It flows through the blood of the righteous. It is the proof of our divinity. To verify one's Resonance is to verify one's soul."

- **Key Event:** Student reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** The students of Squad Gold and Silver nod reverently. They have heard this story since birth. It validates their privilege. It tells them they deserve to rule because their blood is holy.

### Scene 2: The Correction

- **Key Event:** Angelica's analysis.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica sits in the back row with Squad Iron. She is not nodding. She is taking notes. But she isn't writing down the history; she is writing down logic errors. She calculates the timelines. She references the biological data she hacked from the medical servers.

  - **Error 1:** If Resonance is purity, why does the mutation rate kill 40% of Highborn children during puberty?
  - **Error 2:** If it is a gift, why does using it require High-Calorie intake and cause cellular degradation?
  - **Error 3:** The "Star-Gods" date matches the radioactive venting of the primary drive core.

- **Key Event:** The challenge.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica raises her hand. Halloway pauses, annoyed by the interruption from a "Silt-Rat." He grants her permission to speak, expecting a simple question. Angelica stands up. She reads from her notes. Her voice is calm, factual, and devastatingly loud in the silent hall.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Professor, your timeline is off by three hundred years. The 'Founders' weren't chosen by stars. They were the flight crew assigned to the Engineering deck during the Core Breach."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Professor Halloway:** "Sit down, cadet. You speak heresy."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I speak math. It's not divine selection, Professor. It's genetic compatibility with the focused radiation of the ship's engine core. We aren't gods. We're just mutants with good PR."

### Scene 3: The Silence

- **Key Event:** The room reacts.
- **Detailed Description:** A collective gasp sucks the air out of the room. Squad Gold turns to stare at her with open mouths. To them, this isn't just rude; it is blasphemy. It strikes at the core of their identity. If they aren't divine, they are just monsters.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen's observation.
- **Detailed Description:** Two seats away, Kaelen Night watches. He does not gasp. He does not blink. His face is a mask of perfect indifference. But his eyes are locked on Angelica. He knows she is right. House Night has always known the truth—that the "gods" are just powerful liars. But House Night also knows the value of silence. He watches her burn, calculating the social blast radius.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — He respects her intelligence but despises her lack of survival instinct. He wonders if she will break or turn to ash. Silence is safer. Truth is a weapon only to be drawn when you intend to kill.

### Scene 4: The Detention

- **Key Event:** The punishment.
- **Detailed Description:** Halloway turns purple. He banishes her to the Hall of Penance. It is a small, soundproof room with padded walls. There is no chair. There is no window. There is only a heavy iron rod, weighing twenty pounds. The punishment is simple: she must hold the rod at shoulder height, arms extended, until she admits she lied.

- **Key Event:** The endurance.
- **Detailed Description:** An hour passes. Angelica's deltoids scream. Two hours. Her arms begin to spasm. The pain is blinding. Sweat pours down her face, stinging her eyes. Halloway checks over the intercom. "Admit it, Ward. Admit you are filth." Angelica says nothing. She retreats into her mind. She visualizes the rod not as a weight, but as a variable in a physics equation. _Force = Mass x Acceleration._ She solves quadratic equations in her head to distract herself from the agony. Her Pride is harder than the iron.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She proves her will is unbreakable. She would rather tear her muscles apart than speak a lie to please a fool.

- **Key Event:** The release.
- **Detailed Description:** Three hours later, Halloway opens the door. He expects to find her collapsed, weeping. He finds her still standing, shaking violently, but the rod is still up. She looks him in the eye. He steps back, a flicker of genuine fear in his milk-clouded eyes. He sees something in her that scares him—the absolute refusal to break. "Get out," he whispers. "Just get out."

- **Key Event:** The hallway conversation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica drops the rod. It clang loudly. She walks out, her arms numb and useless at her sides. Kaelen is waiting in the hallway, leaning against a locker. He has been waiting for an hour.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Was it worth the pain? You gained nothing. You converted no one."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I didn't do it for them. I did it for me. If I agree to the lie, I become part of the lie."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Survival requires adaptation. Sometimes adaptation requires silence."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The truth implies that your gods are just batteries, Night. I can see why you prefer the lie. It's much deeper. It's much safer. go back to your shadows. leave the light to me."
