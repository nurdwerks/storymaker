## Chapter 11: The Museum

### Scene 1: The Breach / Astronomy Floor, Museum of Pre-History

- **Key Event:** The Museum of Pre-History is a lie built of white marble and silence. It floats in the upper curve of Sol-Terra, suspended by anti-grav tethers that hum with a sound like a headache.
- **Key Event:** The team rappels from the ventilation ducts. The ropes hiss as they slide down into the Astronomy Floor.
- **Key Event:** It is a room of stars. Holographic constellations—Earth constellations—drift in the air. Orion. Ursa Major. The Southern Cross. They are beautiful, and they are fake.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet hangs upside down from her tether, her goggles flashing with data streams. "Grid is active," she whispers. "Class-4 Laser Net. It shifts every three seconds. Don't touch the red light, or you get diced."
- **Key Event:** Angelica drops to the floor. She lands in a crouch, silent. She sees the grid. It is a shifting cage of ruby lasers, moving like a living thing.
- **Key Event:** She breathes. In... Out.
- **Key Event:** She moves.
- **Key Event:** It is a dance. She ducks under a beam that slices the air at neck height. She pirouettes through a gap that exists for only a heartbeat. She vaults over a low sweeper-beam.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr watches from the shadows, his cyber-eye recording. He whistles low. "I knew she could punch, but I didn't know she could dance."
- **Key Event:** Angelica lands on the other side, next to the control console. She jams a bypass chip into the port. The lasers flicker and die.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She utilizes her agility and tactical focus to dance through the lethal laser grid without triggering alarms. She proves she is not just a brawler, but a precision instrument.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Grid down. You're welcome."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** _(Breathing hard)_ "Clear. Move up."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "You missed a spot. Oh wait, no, that was just my heart stopping."

### Scene 2: The Exhibits / Hall of History

- **Key Event:** They move deeper. Into the *Hall of History*.
- **Key Event:** It is a shrine to the "Founders." Statues of the original Captains stand twenty feet tall, forged in gold and platinum. They look noble. They look kind.
- **Key Event:** And in the shadows, there are the villains. The "Traitors."
- **Key Event:** Angelica stops. She is staring at a display case.
- **Key Event:** Inside is a holographic bust of a man. He has her eyes. He has her jawline.
- **Key Event:** The plaque reads: **GENERAL LEO VANCE. TRAITOR. ARCHITECT OF THE INSURRECTION. EXECUTED FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.**
- **Key Event:** The hologram shows him snarling, his face distorted to look monstrous. It shows him ordering the execution of civilians.
- **Key Event:** It is a lie. A perfectly crafted, high-definition lie.
- **Key Event:** Angelica presses her hand against the glass. Her fingerprints leave a smudge on the pristine surface.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She remembers him properly. The smell of his pipe tobacco. The way he laughed. He wasn't a monster. He was a man who tried to save them from the dark. They took his life, and then they took his name.
- **Key Event:** She feels a crack in her heart, but she seals it with anger.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She exhibits a deep personal conviction and rejection of the state's narrative, reaffirming her belief in her father’s innocence.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "They made you ugly, Dad. But I know the truth."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** _(Stepping up beside her)_ "History is written by the victors, kid. And the victors are usually the ones with the best PR budget."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Then we need to rewrite it."

### Scene 3: The Leverage / Inner Sanctum

- **Key Event:** They reach the heavy vault door of the Sanctum. Lisbet starts working on the lock, her fingers a blur.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr wanders off. He is looking at a display of "Old World Currency." Diamonds. Rubies. Gold bars.
- **Key Event:** His hand twitches. The "Midas" bond is hungry. The numbers on his wrist are ticking down. **[000,400]**.
- **Key Event:** He reaches for the glass. "It's just sitting there," he mutters. "Enough to buy a moon."
- **Key Event:** Angelica grabs his wrist. Her grip is iron.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr snarls, his eyes flashing greed-gold. "Let go, Princess. I need to eat."
- **Key Event:** Angelica doesn't flinch. She looks him in the eye.
- **Key Event:** "Steal that, and you're rich for a day," she says. "Help me, and you get a seat on the High Council. You get to *make* the money."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr freezes. He runs the calculation. Short-term gain vs. Long-term equity.
- **Key Event:** He pulls his hand back. He smirks, but it's shaky.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She demonstrates cunning leadership, successfully subverting Zephyr’s impulsive greed toward the mission's long-term goals. She speaks his language: transaction.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "A fresh start in a grave isn't worth much. Stay with me, and we buy the bank."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "You drive a hard bargain. Fine. But I'm taking the free pen."

### Scene 4: The Custodian / Inner Sanctum

- **Key Event:** The vault door hisses open.
- **Key Event:** Inside, on a pedestal of floating light, is the *Cylinder of Truth*.
- **Key Event:** But it isn't unguarded.
- **Key Event:** The floor plates shift. A mechanism groans. Rising from the floor is *The Custodian*.
- **Key Event:** It is nine feet tall. A Synth-Guardian made of polished ceramics and carbon fiber. It has four arms. Two hold shock-batons; two hold rapid-fire plasma casters. Its face is a smooth, blank oval with a single red eye.
- **Key Event:** **Security Protocol Initiated. Please present clearance or be sanitized.**
- **Key Event:** It opens fire.
- **Key Event:** Green plasma bolts chew up the marble floor.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr moves. He dives forward, his cybernetic arm deploying a localized shield-wall.
- **Key Event:** The plasma impacts his shield, splashing like liquid fire. His credit counter ticks down rapidly. **-100... -100... -100...**
- **Key Event:** "Go!" he yells. "Get the Cylinder! I'll distract the toaster!"
- **Key Event:** Zephyr engages the droid. It's a suicide run. He is dodging batons that could smash concrete. He is firing his blaster into the droid's joints, blowing off chunks of ceramic armor.
- **Key Event:** Angelica slides under the droid's legs. She scrambles up the pedestal. She grabs the Cylinder.
- **Key Event:** The alarms scream. The whole museum turns red.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr takes a hit. A baton strike to the ribs. He goes flying, coughing blood.
- **Key Event:** But he laughs. He checks his counter. It's low, but he's alive.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He commits to his role as the team's protector, sacrificing his life-sustaining credits to hold off the superior mechanical opponent.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Hey! Chrome-Dome! Over here! Your mother was a calculator!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Got it! Zephyr, move!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** _(Firing wildly)_ "I'm moving! Mostly backwards!"

### Scene 5: The Patron

- **Key Event:** In the museum's private VIP viewing lounge, **Baron Gilded** sips champagne while watching the chaos unfold on security monitors.
- **Detailed Description:** Baron Gilded is not surprised by the breach—he funded the museum's security systems and knows their weaknesses. He watches the Ward girl grab the Cylinder with calculating interest. The artifact's true value isn't in the vault; it's in who wants it badly enough to risk everything. He makes a note to investigate Ward's backers. Where there is desperation, there is opportunity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded (to his assistant):** "Don't alert security. Let them take it. The Cylinder leads to something far more valuable. Track the girl. She'll lead us to the real treasure."
