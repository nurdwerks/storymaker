## I. Role in the Story

Dr. Splicer is a genetics expert fascinated by Prelate Vane’s vision of the "Perfected Human." They represent the clinical end-point of the Zenith's genetic engineering programs.

- **The Interaction:** They discuss eugenics with Vane over lunch, treating life as a math problem rather than a biological reality.
- **The Dehumanization:** They look at Angelica and discuss her "breeding potential" and "genetic yield" as if she isn't in the room, making her feel like livestock rather than a person with agency.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 32: Kaelen's Stand](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2520-2540)
- **Defining Quote:** "Stared out from the tank, their mouth fused shut." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: GREED/BECAME THE EXPERIMENT)
