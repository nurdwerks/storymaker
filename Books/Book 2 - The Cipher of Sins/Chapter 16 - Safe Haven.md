## Chapter 16: Safe Haven

### Scene 1: The Interception / Flower District Plaza

- **Key Event:** Rain slicks the cobblestones of Sector 7. The neon signs reflect in the puddles.
- **Key Event:** Angelica and her team are running. Wounded. Panting.
- **Key Event:** A shadow drops from the rooftops.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night. The Black Paladin.
- **Key Event:** He lands in front of them. His sword, _Shadow-Drinker_, is drawn.
- **Key Event:** Beside him lands Squire Pip. Small, nervous, holding a stun-baton.
- **Key Event:** "Halt," Kaelen commands. His voice is gravel.
- **Key Event:** A scavenger lunges at Pip from the alley. A desperate junkie.
- **Key Event:** Pip panics. He swings the baton. Too much power.
- **Key Event:** _CRACK._
- **Key Event:** The scavenger falls. Neck broken. Dead.
- **Key Event:** Pip stares at the body. He drops the baton. He starts to shake. He vomits.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen freezes. He looks at his squire. The boy is broken.
- **Key Event:** He looks at Angelica. She is watching them, not attacking.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen makes a choice. Duty or Humanity.
- **Key Event:** He sheathes his sword.
- **Key Event:** he steps between Pip and the body.
- **Key Event:** "I said GO!" he roars at Angelica. "The sector is unsecured. We are retreating to regroup. That is an order."
- **Key Event:** Angelica nods. She understands the mercy.
- **Key Event:** She passes Pip. She pauses.
- **Key Event:** "Welcome to the war, kid," she whispers. "It doesn't get easier."

### Scene 2: The Safehouse / "Petal & Stem"

- **Key Event:** Hatcher leads them through a maze of back alleys.
- **Key Event:** He stops at a quaint shop. "Petal & Stem: Fine Botanicals."
- **Key Event:** It looks like a grandma's house. Lace curtains. Flower pots.
- **Key Event:** "Hatcher," Angelica hisses. "We need a fortress, not a florist."
- **Key Event:** "This is a fortress," Hatcher says.
- **Key Event:** He knocks. A rhythmic code.
- **Key Event:** The door opens.
- **Key Event:** An old woman stands there. Silver hair in a bun. A knitted shawl.
- **Key Event:** "Joyce," Hatcher says.
- **Key Event:** She smiles. It is a sweet smile.
- **Key Event:** "You're bleeding on my porch, detective," she says. "Come in before you ruin the petunias."

### Scene 3: The Sanctuary / Flower Shop Interior

- **Key Event:** Inside, it smells of lavender and tea.
- **Key Event:** Joyce leads them to the back room.
- **Key Event:** She moves a vase of daisies. Presses a hidden button.
- **Key Event:** The wall of shelving rotates.
- **Key Event:** Behind it is an armory.
- **Key Event:** But not standard guns.
- **Key Event:** Knitting needles made of "Null-Iron" (armor-piercing). Flowers genetically modified to spray neurotoxins. Tea blends that are actually coagulants or poisons.
- **Key Event:** "Grandma is a spy," Angelica realizes.
- **Key Event:** Joyce sees her looking.
- **Key Event:** "Television always did add ten pounds of menace," Joyce says, picking up a medical kit.
- **Key Event:** She starts cleaning Hatcher's wound.
- **Key Event:** "I just scrubbed the blood and grime out of this rug last Tuesday," she scolds gently. "And I'm not in the mood to do it again so soon."
- **Key Event:** Suddenly, she pauses. Her hand hovers over the antiseptic.
- **Key Event:** Her eyes go blank. Terror.
- **Key Event:** "Where...?" she whispers.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher knows the look. A "Hollow." Her bonded spirit is eating a memory.
- **Key Event:** "Top shelf, left cabinet," Hatcher says softly. "Behind the chamomile. Right?"
- **Key Event:** Joyce blinks. The light returns to her eyes.
- **Key Event:** She smiles. "Right where I left it. You always were observant, Detective."

### Scene 4: The Debrief / The Parlor

- **Key Event:** They sit in the parlor. Drinking tea (the healing kind).
- **Key Event:** Angelica tells Joyce the truth. About the Zenith. About the Ship.
- **Key Event:** Joyce listens. Sipping her tea.
- **Key Event:** She doesn't look surprised.
- **Key Event:** "I always suspected," she says. "The gravity was too artificial. The stars... too static."
- **Key Event:** She looks at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** "You've opened the box, dear," she says.
- **Key Event:** "Now you can never go back. Now you know. And knowing will destroy you—or save you. I honestly can't tell which."
- **Key Event:** She pours more tea.
- **Key Event:** "But until then," she says, "have a biscuit. It's ginger and cyanide. Good for the digestion."
