# Character Profile: Sergeant "Knuckles"

**Archetype:** The Enforcer / The Loyal Heart
**True Sin:** WRATH (He only understands the world through conflict and physical dominance).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (He claims his hate for Angelica is just about "Protecting the Boss").

## I. Role in the Story

Sergeant "Knuckles" is a brawler who would die for Ria. He represents the raw, physical bond of the Vanguard—a bond forged in blood and mud.

- **The Suspicion:** He views Angelica as a "Princess" who doesn't understand the true cost of war. "You give the orders, Princess. We do the dying," he tells her.
- **The Authority:** He cleans his gun while listening to Ria, ignoring Angelica's commands. His genuine love for Ria serves as a painful reminder of the loyalty Angelica has yet to earn.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Crisis of Heroism / Psychological Trauma. **Location: Book 3, Chapter 22 (The Bridge).** During the Siege of Sector 12, Knuckles is forced to blow the only bridge connecting refugee camps to safety to stop a Praetorian advance. He watches civilians fall to their deaths. He chooses the squad, but the guilt of the "necessary" deaths breaks his bravado.
  **Quote:** _"Forgive me."_
- **Impact on Ria:** Ria is forced to take command when Knuckles becomes catatonic with guilt. She loses her "shield," realizing that the burden of leadership means making the very choices that broke her mentor.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Loud Heart" is silenced. The Vanguard becomes a grim, professional unit that lacks the warmth Knuckles provided, turning their "family" into a group of mourning soldiers who only look at the mission, never each other.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Key Event | The group prepares for the heist; Angelica rebuilds her Haptic Glove into "Shock-Knuckles" while Lisbet identifies a Class-7 Synth-Guardian, "The Custodian," as the main obstacle. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 24 | Key Event | The team fights off the "Rust-Jackals" gang and Warden squads. Angelica destroys a combat droid with her shock-knuckles, her Gene-Key-enhanced reflexes recognizing threats before she does. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 14 | Key Event | "Knuckles" (Ria's second-in-command) is pinned nearest the crusher. He manages to throw a gravity-grenade to disrupt the field, freeing the others. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 14 | Moment | **Knuckles** — He gives a thumbs up before becoming a 2D smear on the deck. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | She looks at her armor. It is deep-gouged. Knuckles is dead. They killed maybe five Shards. The Sphere has launched thousands. |
