## Chapter 04: The Crack in the Shield

### Scene 1: Engineering Core

- **Key Event:** The ship's main shields begin to fluctuate. It isn't an attack; the energy is simply dissipating, as if the physics of the shield are being rewritten.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She is typing furiously, sweating. She realizes her counter-hacks are useless because the enemy isn't hacking the software; it's hacking the laws of physics.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "I can't patch this! It's deleting the concept of 'Barrier' from the system!"

### Scene 2: The Corridor

- **Key Event:** Ria walks down the hall with Titan. The metal walls begin to hum. Titan growls at the bulkhead, sensing the intrusion.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She puts a hand on the wall and feels it vibrating. It feels cold, like ice.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Easy, big guy. It's just the house settling." (She knows it isn't).

### Scene 3: The Lab (Reused Space)

- **Key Event:** Lisbet isolates the interference source. It is a signal coming directly from the Sphere. It penetrates the lead shielding of the hull effortlessly.
- **Key Event:** She realizes the signal is a loop. A message.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "It's not static. It's a file. Someone open a channel."
