## Chapter 32: The Debate

### Scene 1: The Aftermath / The Bi-Core, _Zenith_ Lower Levels

- **Key Event:** The Bi-Core is silent. The Mother—the massive biological computer—is dormant. The fleshy tendrils that once pulsed with light are now grey and still.
- **Key Event:** The air is thick with the smell of ozone and decay. The hum of the cooling fans is the only sound.
- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris is already at a console. He ignores the dead bodies of the Blighted guards. He ignores the blood on the floor.
- **Key Event:** He plugs his interface jack into the mainframe. "Remarkable," he mutters. "The neural architecture... it's not just storage. It's generative."
- **Key Event:** Ria wipes slime off her armor. "Is it dead, Doc? That's all I care about."
- **Key Event:** "Dormant," Aris corrects. "And full of data. I'm initiating a download."
- **Key Event:** Angelica steps forward. "Download what? That thing tried to replace us."
- **Key Event:** Aris looks up, his eyes manic. "Everything. The evolutionary data. The resistance profiles. We can cure the Pathogen. Or better yet, refine it. We hold the keys to the next stage of human history."
- **Key Event:** He types faster.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Shows no remorse for the near-extinction of the group, focusing only on the "academic treasure."

### Scene 2: The Ideology / The Bi-Core

- **Key Event:** "Stop," Zephyr says. He steps between Aris and the console.
- **Key Event:** He levels his shotgun at the screen.
- **Key Event:** "Are you insane?" Aris snaps. "This is the library of Alexandria!"
- **Key Event:** "It's a weapon," Zephyr says. "And if we take it back to the Spire, Vane will use it. He'll make 'better' servants. He'll make sure the Undercity stays under the boot forever."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen nods. "Zephyr is right. This technology... it’s slave-making. It shouldn't exist."
- **Key Event:** Aris sneers. "Spoken like a brute. You destroy what you don't understand."
- **Key Event:** "I understand enough," Zephyr growls. "Every time 'history' shows up on this ship, somebody gets a boot to the neck. I say we melt the keys. The Great Reset."
- **Key Event:** "You're talking about erasing a cure!" Aris shouts. "Millions could be saved!"
- **Key Event:** "Or enslaved!" Zephyr shouts back.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Advocates for "The Great Reset," destroying the Zenith legacy to let the Undercity start over without class structures.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Every time 'history' shows up on this ship, somebody gets a boot to the neck. I say we melt the keys."

### Scene 3: The Verdict / The Bi-Core

- **Key Event:** They look at Angelica. The Captain. The deciding vote.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the screen. She sees the data streams. Medical files. Genetic maps.
- **Key Event:** She thinks of the people dying of the Rot in Sector 4. She thinks of the children born with gills because the air scrubbers failed.
- **Key Event:** "We don't destroy it," she says.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks betrayed. "Angelica..."
- **Key Event:** "And we don't give it to Vane," she adds.
- **Key Event:** She walks to the console. She pushes Aris aside.
- **Key Event:** "I'm encrypting it. Access requires three keys. Three distinct bio-signatures. Mine. Yours, Zephyr. And yours, Aris."
- **Key Event:** "Me?" Aris blinks. "Why me?"
- **Key Event:** "Because you'll never agree with Zephyr," she says. "And Zephyr will never agree with you. The only way this opens is if all three of us agree it's necessary."
- **Key Event:** She types the command. The screen flashes **LOCKED by TRIAD PROTOCOL**.
- **Key Event:** "Knowledge isn't the enemy," she says. "Monopoly is. We keep the data, but no one person—not even me—can open it alone."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Chooses a middle path: she locks the data behind a "Moral Override" that requires three keys to access, which she distributes among the group.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Knowledge isn't the enemy. Monopoly is. We keep the data, but no one person—not even me—can open it alone."

### Scene 4: The Departure / The Outer Hull Airlock

- **Key Event:** They leave the Bi-Core. The heavy blast doors seal behind them.
- **Key Event:** They climb. Up through the maintenance shafts. Up past the ventilation cyclers.
- **Key Event:** They reach the Outer Hull Airlock. The highest point in the ship.
- **Key Event:** Angelica spins the wheel. The door opens.
- **Key Event:** The wind howls. But it's not wind. It's the hum of the energy shield that keeps the vacuum out.
- **Key Event:** Above them, through the transparency field, is space. Stars. Millions of them. Cold and bright.
- **Key Event:** They stand in silence. The debate in the basement feels small compared to the infinite void above.
- **Key Event:** "Where to now, Captain?" Kaelen asks.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the stars. Somewhere out there is Earth. Or what's left of it.
- **Key Event:** "Up," she whispers. "To the glass. I want to see if the stars are still there."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Where to now, Captain?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Up. To the glass. I want to see if the stars are still there."
