# Character Profile: Squire Pip

**Archetype:** The Student / The Hero-Worshipper
**True Sin:** WRATH (His jealousy over Kaelen's attention manifests as unthinking hostility toward Angelica).
**Virtue Mask:** ENTHUSIASM (He plays the part of the perfect, eager squire to hide his petty nature).

## I. Role in the Story

Squire Pip is a young boy training to be a knight under Kaelen's guidance. He represents the cycle of "hero-worship" that keeps the noble order alive.

- **The Jealousy:** He looks at Kaelen with religious devotion and views Angelica as a "witch" who is trying to steal his hero's soul.
- **The Stings:** Kaelen's patience and gentle mentorship with the boy make Angelica realize the kind of softness Kaelen is capable of—a softness she feels he denies to her.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Traumatic Awakening. During a skirmish, Pip is forced to kill for the first time to save Kaelen's life. He succeeds, but the experience shatters his "heroic" illusions of knighthood, leaving him shell-shocked and silent.
- **Impact on Kaelen Night:** Kaelen feels a deep, agonizing guilt for "corrupting" the boy. He stops being a gentle mentor and becomes a harsh, demanding drill sergeant, trying to "harden" Pip so he won't be broken by the world again.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Innocence" of the guard is gone. Seeing the once-bright boy turn into a hollow-eyed soldier-in-training makes the rest of the guard realize the true, dark cost of their service to the Night family.

**Event Location:** Book 2, Chapter 16
**Defining Quote:** _"I... I got him. I saved you, my Lord."_

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Key Event | The Squire. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Beside him lands **Squire Pip**. He is small, nervous, his armor too big for him. He holds a stun-baton with a shaking hand. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Suddenly, a scavenger—a desperate, drug-addled junkie—lunges at Pip from a pile of trash. He has a rusted knife. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Pip panics. He swings the baton with his full strength, eyes closed. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Pip stares at the body. He drops the baton. He starts to shake violently. He pulls off his helmet and vomits onto the cobblestones. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Pip:** "I... I didn't mean... he was just..." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Kaelen freezes. He looks at his squire. The boy is broken. He looks at the body. Then he looks at Angelica. She is watching them, weapon lowered. She isn't attacking. She looks sad. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | He steps between Pip and the body, shielding the boy from the sight. He turns to Angelica. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Angelica nods. She understands the mercy. As she passes Pip, she pauses for a second. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | **Pip**, a seven-year-old orphan who follows Lisbet around, had crept closer to see the "monster." He is holding a toy robot. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 18 | Dialog | **Lisbet:** "Pip! Run!" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 19 | Key Event | The catalyst for the riot is the death of Pip, a young scavenger who volunteered to test Aris's new fungal-filtration mask. The mask failed, and Pip suffocated on spore-choked air. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 19 | Key Event | Mara, Pip's aunt and the informal leader of the civilian faction, holds a length of heavy pipe. She is screaming for blood. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 19 | Moment | **Dr. Aris** — He looks up at Mara, genuinely confused by her anger. He doesn't see a tragedy; he sees a dataset. "The failure provided critical data, Mara. The next prototype will have a 94% success rate. Pip's contribution was... efficient." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 19 | Key Event | She acknowledges the anger. She doesn't dismiss Pip's death. But she reframes the narrative from "Murder" to "Resource Management." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Detailed Description | She holds a datapad in her lap. On the screen is a list of names. Casualties. Pip, the young signal runner who took a plasma bolt meant for her. Lord Vermillion, who stayed behind to hold the door. Torque, the mechanic who blew the bridge. The list is getting longer. Every name weighs a thousand tons. She traces the letters of Pip's name with her thumb, the screen cool against her skin. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 24 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "I'm turning to stone. I can feel it. When Pip died... I didn't cry. I just checked his ammo count and redistributed it. I'm becoming him. I'm becoming Vane." |
