## I. Role in the Story

Sergeant "Brick" Wall is a massive heavy-weapons specialist who acts as General Ironwood’s unofficial bodyguard. He represents the physical weight and immovable nature of Ironwood's legion.

- **The Ritual:** He and Ironwood share a quiet cigar before battle—a ritual of warrior-intimacy that Angelica is barred from, leaving her feeling profoundly lonely even in the midst of an army.
- **The Nickname:** He refers to Angelica as "The Sparkler," a diminutive nickname that belittles her power and treats her magic as a triviality compared to the "real" weight of his steel.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 26: The Forging of Wrath](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2050-2070)
- **Defining Quote:** "Breach!" (His last word as he dies shielding Ironwood. Reveals flaw: WRATH/TOTAL DEVOTION)
