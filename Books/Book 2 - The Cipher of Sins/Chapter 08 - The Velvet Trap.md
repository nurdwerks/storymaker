### Scene 1: The Delivery (The Wounded Runner)

- **Key Event:** Pixel, one of Lisbet's young runners, arrives at the safehouse door, critically injured.
- **Detailed Description:** The heavy iron door of "The Rusty Gear" shudders with a frantic, weak pounding. Hatcher opens the slat, checking for Wardens, then quickly unbolts the door. Pixel stumbles in, collapsing onto the grimy floor. She is a street kid, maybe twelve years old, wearing oversized mechanics' coveralls. Her face is a mess of blood. The socket where her cheap, scavenged cybernetic eye used to be is now a raw, empty hole, weeping fluid. She clutches a small, blood-slicked data-spike in her trembling hand.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet freezes. The "Glitch" persona drops. She rushes to Pixel, her hands hovering over the injury, afraid to touch it. Pixel was under her protection. The violence inflicted on the child cuts through Lisbet's cynicism. Rage, cold and sharp, begins to replace her fear.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She is deeply shaken and vengeful after Pixel’s injury, showing a protective, human side beneath her glitchy exterior. She stops speaking in slang and code, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Pixel:** "They took my eye, Liz. But I kept the data. I swallowed it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Who did this? Give me a name, Pixel. I will crash their pacemaker."

- **Key Event:** Pixel delivers the decryption key.
- **Detailed Description:** Pixel coughs, spitting out the small, bio-safe capsule containing the key. Hatcher catches it. He carries the girl to a cot, shouting for clean water and bandages. The mood in the safehouse shifts from cautious planning to grim determination. The enemy has hurt a child. Now it is personal.

### Scene 2: The Decryption (The Star Chart)

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Lisbet unlock Solon's data-chip.
- **Detailed Description:** They gather around a salvaged holo-table. Lisbet inserts the key into her deck, her fingers flying over the haptic keyboard. The screen flickers, fighting the encryption, then stabilizes. A complex, three-dimensional model projects into the air above the table. It is not a map of the city, but a star chart. Constellations rotate slowly. Superimposed over the stars is a wireframe schematic of the Zenith Spire. A red line connects a specific star to a specific room in the Zenith.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica stares at the map. The patterns look familiar. They match the Fibonacci sequences she used to study in engineering. It isn't just data; it's art. She realizes Solon didn't just hide the information; he encoded it in the architecture of the city itself.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her ability to recognize order in the seemingly random "aesthetic" encryption highlights her analytical intelligence and unique heritage. She sees the logic where others see chaos.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "It's not random. It's a vector. The Spire is pointing at something."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Pointing where? That star system doesn't exist on public charts."

### Scene 3: The Target (The Museum of Pre-History)

- **Key Event:** The map identifies "Exhibit 404: The Cylinder of Truth" as the location of the information.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica traces the red line down through the levels of the Spire model. It terminates in a large, circular hall located in the Mid-Levels: The Museum of Pre-History. Specifically, a restricted vault labeled "Exhibit 404." The label is ominous—an error code in the old internet language.
- **Internal Conflict:** Hatcher leans back, lighting a cigarette. The smoke curls around the hologram. He knows the museum. It is a place of propaganda, where the Founders display the "savagery" of the pre-Ascension world to justify their rule. The idea that the truth is hidden in a monument to lies strikes him as a bitter joke.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He questions the entire foundation of the Zenith's history, suggesting that the "Ascension" might be a manufactured myth.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "The Museum? That place is a graveyard of lies. They keep the old world there to mock it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "They hid the truth in the one place no one looks: The past. It's perfect."

### Scene 4: The Heist Prep (Upgrading the Arsenal)

- **Key Event:** The group prepares for the infiltration.
- **Detailed Description:** The safehouse becomes a workshop. The air fills with the smell of soldering iron and ozone. Angelica sits at a workbench, dismantling her Haptic Glove. She replaces the delicate sensors with heavy-duty capacitors scavenged from a broken stun-baton. She rewires the feedback loops to discharge outward, turning the tool into a weapon—"Shock-Knuckles."
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica works with a manic focus. She is transforming herself from a mechanic into a soldier. She looks at her hands—hands that used to fix toys—and sees weapons. It is a necessary evolution, but one that scares her.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her skill as a scavenger and engineer is proven as she upgrades her weapons using only salvaged parts and scraps. She finds comfort in the machinery; it is the one thing she can control.

- **Key Event:** Lisbet identifies the threat.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet pulls up the security schematics for the museum. "Bad news," she announces. "The vault is guarded by a Class-7 Synth-Guardian. Model: The Custodian." She projects an image of a nine-foot-tall droid with four arms and a chassis made of bonded cerma-plate. It is designed to suppress riots.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr whistles low. He checks the charge on his blaster. A Class-7 is military hardware. They are walking into a meat grinder. But he looks at the gold tooth he pulled from Gilded (in his imagination/future planning) and grins. High risk, high reward.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Big metal ugly. I can distract it. Midas can annoy anything."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "We don't need to destroy it. We just need to get past it. We're thieves, not an army."
