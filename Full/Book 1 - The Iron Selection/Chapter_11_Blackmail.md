# Chapter 11: Blackmail

The walk back from the Arena was a blur of concrete and pain.

Angelica moved like a machine with a failing battery. Her legs felt heavy, her steps clumsy. The adrenaline that had fueled her kinetic outburst in the locker room was gone, replaced by a hollow, aching exhaustion that seemed to vibrate in her marrow.

It was the "Comedown."

Every resonant knew it, though they whispered about it in different ways. The Bronze cadets called it "The Rust," a feeling of stiff joints and mental fog. The Silvers called it "The Static," a ringing in the ears that lasted for hours.

For Angelica, it felt like being scraped clean.

She walked alone. The other cadets from Squad Iron gave her a wide berth. They didn't jostle her. They didn't throw insults. They didn't even look at her.

She had become something consistently terrifying: an anomaly.

"Did you see her eyes?" someone whispered as she passed. "They glowed. Like a reactor leak."

"And the wall," another muttered. "She dented the blasted wall. She's a skinny little nothing. How does she generate that kind of torque?"

"Maybe she's not human. Maybe Vane built her in a lab."

Angelica kept her head down, staring at the red emergency strips on the floor. She wanted to tell them to shut up. She wanted to tell them that she was just a girl who was tired of being pushed.

But she didn't have the energy.

Aeon was silent on her shoulder. The gryphon had gone into a low-power mode, his head tucked under his wing, conserving his own chrono-energy. He was heavy, a warm weight that grounded her, reminding her that she wasn't completely alone.

"Ward."

The voice wasn't a whisper. It was a command.

Angelica stopped. She knew that voice. It was the same voice that barked orders during drills, the voice that tried to hold Squad Iron together with sheer force of will.

She looked up.

Kaelen Night was leaning against the bulkhead door that led to Sector G-4. He wasn't wearing his helmet. His face, usually composed and stoic, looked troubled. A scar ran down his left cheek—a souvenir from a childhood "accident" he never talked about.

"Squad Leader," Angelica said, her voice raspy. She made to salute, but her arm felt like lead.

"At ease," Kaelen said, waving the formality away. He pushed himself off the wall and walked towards her. He moved differently than the gym-muscle boys of Squad Gold. He moved with economy. No wasted energy.

He stopped a foot away from her. He was tall, but not like Ria. Ria was a mountain; Kaelen was a cliff face—sharp, unyielding, and dangerous if you lost your footing.

"I saw the playback," Kaelen said quietly.

"I imagine everyone has," Angelica replied, looking at his boots.

"Not the broadcast feed," Kaelen corrected. "I pulled the telemetry data from the suit sensors. You didn't just hit Toro. You... changed him."

Angelica looked up, alarmed. "What do you mean?"

"His onboard vitals spiked _before_ the impact," Kaelen said, his eyes narrowing. "His cortisol levels—stress hormones—went through the roof. He wasn't just hurt, Ward. He was terrified. For a split second before the blast, his suit registered a 'Chronal Displacement Warning.' That's a system error usually reserved for when we fight Void-Beasts."

He took a step closer.

"What are you, Ward? Mechanics don't trigger Class-A system warnings. Mechanics don't dent steel with their minds."

Angelica felt a cold sweat prickle on her neck. Kaelen wasn't a bully. He was smart. That made him worse.

"I got lucky," she lied. "Adrenaline. Desperation. Maybe his suit malfunctioned."

"Suits don't malfunction in a way that breaks bones," Kaelen countered.

He looked at the sleeping gryphon on her shoulder.

"It's the bird, isn't it? The Artificers say they consume time. Did you... feed it?"

"No!" Angelica said, too quickly. "Aeon isn't a weapon. He's a..."

"...a battery?" Kaelen suggested. "A catalyst?"

He sighed. He looked around the empty corridor, checking for listeners.

"Listen to me, Ward. The Instructors are watching you now. Vane is watching you. If you're dangerous to the Squad, I have to report it. My job is to keep Iron alive. All of us."

"I'm not dangerous," Angelica whispered. "I just... I didn't want to lose."

Kaelen looked at her for a long moment. He seemed to be weighing her soul against the regulations manual.

"Winning isn't the same as surviving," he said finally. "You made a scene today. Scenes get noticed. And in this place, getting noticed is the first step to getting erased."

He stepped aside, clearing the path to the door.

"Watch your six, Ward. The locker room isn't the only place with blind spots."

He didn't wait for a response. He turned and walked away, back towards the command center, leaving Angelica standing alone in the red light of the emergency strips.

She shivered. The "Comedown" felt colder now.

She reached the showers.

Sector G-4's communal hygiene block was a grim affair. It was a cavernous room tiled in cracked ceramic that had once been white but was now stained a permanent, sickly yellow by the mineral-heavy water. It smelled of industrial disinfectant, mold, and the copper tang of blood washing down the drains.

Steam filled the air, thick and suffocating. It wasn't the clean, refreshing steam of a sauna; it was the humid exhaust of a thousand tired bodies.

Angelica stripped off her sparring gear. Her fingers fumbled with the clasps of her greaves. Her hands were still trembling—a fine, persistent tremor that made it hard to grip anything smaller than a wrench.

She dropped her clothes in a pile on the bench. She looked at her body in the reflection of a polished steel pipe.

She looked bruised.

There were dark purple welts on her ribs where Toro had hit her. A scrape on her cheek was already scabbing over. But it was her hands that drew her eye. The veins on the back of her hands were dark, standing out against her pale skin like a roadmap of blue ink.

"Bio-electric stress," she whispered, touching one of the veins. It felt hot.

She stepped into the shower stall.

She turned the handle. The pipes groaned—a deep, metallic shudder that vibrated through the floor—before spitting out a burst of brown water that quickly cleared to grey.

It was lukewarm. It was always lukewarm.

Angelica stood under the spray, letting the water run over her face. She closed her eyes. She tried to wash away the smell of the Black Sand. She tried to wash away the image of the boys flying through the air.

_I hurt them,_ she thought. _I didn't mean to, but I did._

And the terrifying part wasn't the guilt.

It was the satisfaction.

For a split second, when the power had surged through her, she hadn't felt small. She hadn't felt like a scavenger. She had felt... absolute.

"Is that what you feel, Aeon?" she whispered to the empty room. "Power?"

The pipes groaned again.

It was a deep, tectonic rumble that vibrated through the floor and up into the soles of her feet. It spoke of age, of neglect, of a city that was slowly eating itself from the inside out. In the Silt, pipes didn't groan; they screamed. Here, even the infrastructure sounded tired.

And then, they went silent.

The water pressure died instantly. The spray turned into a dribble, then a drip.

Angelica opened her eyes. She wiped the soap from her face, blinking against the sting.

"Hello?" she called out. "Maintenance? The water's out!"

Silence.

No, not silence.

Heavy breathing.

Angelica turned around.

Ria was standing in the doorway of the shower block.

She wasn't naked. She was fully armored. She wore her heavy combat vest, her fatigues, and her boots. The steam swirled around her, clinging to the cold metal of her bracers. She looked like a tank parked in a flower garden—out of place, imposing, and incredibly dangerous.

She was blocking the only exit.

"Ria?" Angelica said, her voice echoing in the tiled room. "What are you doing? Is there a drill?"

Ria didn't answer. She stepped inside. Her boots crunched on the wet tile. _Crunch. Crunch. Crunch._

She walked slowly, deliberately. She stopped five feet from Angelica, looming over her. The size difference was comical. Angelica was five-foot-nothing, wet, naked, and shivering. Ria was six-foot-two of muscle and steel.

Ria leaned in. She smelled of gun oil and metallic ozone.

"Nice trick in the dojo, Ward," she said. Her voice was low, a rumble of gravel and threat. "You made quite a mess. Three concussions. One fractured sternum. Impressive for a runt."

Angelica backed up until her wet back hit the cold tiles of the wall. She crossed her arms over her chest, trying to cover herself, trying to make herself smaller.

"I didn't... I didn't mean to," Angelica stammered.

" didn't mean to?" Ria repeated. She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "You don't accidentally bend three hundred pounds of reinforced steel, Angel."

She reached out and slammed her hand against the wall next to Angelica's head._CLANG._

Angelica flinched.

"I saw the lockers," Ria whispered. "I checked them after the meds took Toro away. Bent like tin foil. No scuff marks. No impact trauma. Just... shaped."

She looked Angelica in the eye.

"I know what kinetic displacement looks like. My father serves in the Heavy Infantry. I've seen mages do that with staffs and gauntlets. But you? You didn't use a spell. You didn't have a focus. You just... pushed. You used pure will."

Ria leaned closer, until her nose was almost touching Angelica's.

"That's raw resonance, Ward. That's illegal."

Angelica held her breath. She knew the laws. Every child in the Zenith knew the laws. Magic was a resource. It was rationed. It was licensed. Unlicensed magic was heresy.

"You know what they do to freaks in the Zenith?" Ria continued, her voice soft, terrifyingly gentle. "They don't just kill them. They send them to the 'Special' wing. The dissection labs. They take you apart to see how you tick. And you don't come back. You just disappear."

Angelica trembled. She felt a tear leak out of her eye, hot against her cold cheek.

"Are you going to report me?" she whispered.

Ria pulled back. She looked at Angelica—really looked at her—for a long moment. She looked at the fear in her eyes. She looked at the bruises on her ribs.

Then, she sighed.

It was a long, heavy sound that seemed to deflate her entire posture. Her shoulders slumped. The aggression drained out of her face, leaving behind something that looked suspiciously like... exhaustion.

"Reviewing blackmail options," Ria muttered to herself.

She turned away, walking over to the row of sinks. She leaned against the porcelain, crossing her massive arms.

"I'm failing Theoretical Resonance," she said.

Angelica blinked. "What?"

"I'm failing," Ria repeated, louder this time. She sounded angry, but not at Angelica. "I can punch through a wall, but I can't calculate the frequency of the shield I'm punching. If I fail the final exam next week, I get recycled. They'll strip my rank and send me to the Mines."

She turned back to Angelica. Her eyes were wide, desperate.

"I won't go to the Mines, Ward. I won't."

Angelica slowly lowered her arms. She saw it now. The armor wasn't just physical; it was emotional. Ria was terrified. The invulnerable tank was just a scared girl who was bad at math.

"So..." Angelica started, her voice steadying. "You want me to... help you?"

"I want a trade," Ria corrected. The predator mask slipped back into place, but it was thinner now. "You're smart. I see you reading the tech manuals for fun. You understand the math. So here's the deal."

She pointed a gloved finger at Angelica.

"You tutor me. You make sure I pass. And I make sure the other squads don't break your fingers. And... I forget what I saw in the locker room."

Angelica stared at her. It wasn't a request. It was extortion.

But it was also an opportunity.

Angelica analyzed the offer. It was a symbiotic relationship. She was a glass cannon—all potential, no defense. Ria was a fortress—all defense, no data processing. Together, they covered each other's weaknesses. It was logical.

It was survival.

Angelica tightened her towel around her chest. She stepped away from the wall.

"Deal," she said.

Ria blinked. She looked surprised. "Just like that?"

"Just like that," Angelica said. She extended her small, scarred hand. "But we do it my way. You listen. You study. If you slack off, I walk. And you don't threaten me again."

Ria looked at the hand. Then she looked at Angelica's face. She snorted.

"You got guts, Runt. I'll give you that."

Ria reached out and grabbed Angelica's hand. Her grip was heavy, cold, and hard as stone. The Steel-Hide bond had already begun to deaden her skin temperature.

"Don't push your luck," Ria warned, but she shook the hand. "Just get the numbers in my head."

"I can fix anything," Angelica promised. "Even your grades."

Ria nodded. She let go.

She turned to leave. But at the door, she paused.

She reached up to the master water valve on the wall—the one that controlled the pressure for the entire block. She gripped the rusted wheel with one hand and twisted it.

_GROAN._

The pipes shuddered.

And then, the water came back on.

But it wasn't the lukewarm drizzle from before. It was hot. Steaming, scalding, glorious hot water burst from the showerheads, filling the room with thick, white clouds.

Ria didn't look back.

"Don't get sentimental, Silt-Rat," she called out over the roar of the water. "It's just business."

She disappeared into the corridor.

Angelica stood there for a moment, watching the steam curl around the empty doorway. Then she stepped back under the spray. The heat hit her like a physical weight, melting the tension in her shoulders, thawing the ice in her veins.

She wasn't alone anymore. She had a tank.

---

The next morning, the social landscape of the Academy shifted. It wasn't an earthquake; it was a subtle realignment of tectonic plates.

Angelica walked into the mess hall with her tray. The smell of synthetic eggs and burnt coffee filled the air. Usually, she walked with her head down, finding a corner table in the "exclusion zone" near the trash compactors.

Today, she stopped in the center of the room.

The noise level dropped. Conversations paused. Forks hovered halfway to mouths.

Angelica looked around. She saw the sneers of Squad Gold. She saw the confusion of Squad Bronze.

Then she saw Ria.

The giant girl was sitting at a table near the window—prime real estate usually reserved for high-ranking Resonants. She was eating a bowl of protein gruel with the same intensity she applied to sparring.

Angelica took a breath. She walked over to the table.

She set her tray down opposite Ria.

The silence in the room stretched thin. This was a violation of the hierarchy. Mechanics didn't sit with Resonants. Silt-Rats didn't sit with Tanks.

Ria didn't look up. She kept eating.

"You're late," Ria grunted around a mouthful of spoon.

"I had to calibrate my leg brace," Angelica said, sitting down. "The servo was acting up."

"Excuses," Ria muttered. She pushed a small carton of milk across the table. It was unopened. "Drink this. You look like a skeleton."

Angelica stared at the milk. Dairy was a luxury. It cost credits.

"I can't pay you for this," Angelica whispered.

"It's not charity," Ria said, finally looking up. Her dark eyes dared anyone in the room to challenge her. "It's an investment. Skeletons can't teach math."

A shadow fell over the table.

It was Lydia, the blonde girl from Squad Gold. She was flanked by two of her sycophants.

"Lost, Stone?" Lydia sneered, ignoring Angelica entirely. "This table is for combat-capable personnel. Your... pet... belongs by the bins."

Ria put her spoon down. She did it slowly. The metal clicked against the plastic tray.

"Angelica is explaining the nutritional density of synthetic protein to me," Ria lied, her voice flat. "It's a study session."

"She's a mechanic," Lydia laughed. "The only thing she can explain is how to fix a toilet."

Ria stood up.

She didn't do it quickly. She unfolded herself. She kept rising until she towered over Lydia.

"She fixed Toro's arm," Ria said quietly. "And she fixed the drone that fixed Toro's arm. And right now, she's fixing my schedule."

Ria leaned in.

"Do you need fixing, Lydia? Because I have a free slot at 0800 in the ring. I can pencil you in for a 'structural realignment'."

Lydia paled. She looked at Ria, then at the silent, watching room.

"You're wasting your potential," Lydia spat. She turned and marched away, her heels clicking angrily on the floor.

Ria sat back down. She picked up her spoon.

"Drink the milk," she ordered.

Angelica opened the carton. It tasted cold and sweet. It tasted like victory.

---

By the afternoon, the "investment" began to pay dividends.

The scheduled exercise was "The Gauntlet"—a grueling obstacle course designed to test mobility and unit cohesion. It involved climbing a vertical wall of shifting pistons, navigating a field of stun-turrets, and crossing a balance beam over a pit of electrified water.

Usually, Angelica ran it alone. She was fast, but she was fragile. The bigger cadets would shoulder-check her into the walls or "accidentally" trip her on the beams.

Today was different.

"Formation Two-Alpha," instructor Krell barked. "Team up. Go."

Angelica felt a hand grab the back of her vest. She was lifted into the air and deposited onto Ria's back.

"Hold on," Ria said.

She launched herself at the wall.

Ria climbed like a spider made of iron. Her fingers found purchase in the gaps between the pistons. She ignored the grinding metal plates that tried to crush her. She just pushed through them.

Angelica clung to her back, her eyes scanning the course ahead.

"Turret at two o'clock!" Angelica shouted. "Tracking your hear-signature!"

Ria didn't look. She trusted the data. She swung left, dodging a bolt of stun-energy that scorched the wall where her head had been a second ago.

"Piston shift!" Angelica warned. "Three meters up. It's going to retract."

Ria adjusted her grip, skipping the faulty piston and launching herself higher.

They moved as a single unit. The Tank and the Spotter. The Brawn and the Brains.

They reached the balance beam. This was the choke point. Three cadets from Squad Bronze were waiting, blocking the path.

"Toll booth," the lead Bronze grinned. "Pay up, Stone. Dump the cargo."

Ria stopped. She looked at the water below. Sparks arced across the surface.

"Cargo is secure," Ria said.

"Then you both swim," the Bronze said, lunging forward.

"Angel, drop!" Ria shouted.

Angelica didn't ask questions. She let go, sliding down Ria's back and landing in a crouch behind her.

Ria met the charge.

She didn't punch. She simply braced. She planted her feet and became a wall. The Bronze cadet hit her and bounced off.

Before he could recover, Ria grabbed him by the belt and the collar.

"Express elevator," she grunted.

She tossed him.

He flew over the edge, screaming until he hit the water. _ZAP._ He flailed, paralyzed by the mild current, until the safety drones fished him out.

The other two Bronzes backed away.

"Move," Ria growled.

They moved.

Ria looked back at Angelica. She held out a hand.

"Up," she said.

Angelica took it.

They crossed the finish line in record time. Krell stared at his stopwatch, then at them. He didn't smile, but he nodded. A single, curt nod of respect.

"Acceptable," Krell muttered.

Ria wiped sweat from her forehead. She grinned at Angelica.

"Not bad, Runt. You make a decent backpack."

"You make a decent elevator," Angelica retorted, though she was smiling so hard her face hurt.

---

The first lesson didn't happen in a library. It happened in the dead of night, three days later...

"I don't get it," Ria growled.

She slammed her datapad onto Angelica's bunk. The screen flickered, showing a complex diagram of a Resonance Waveform—a sine wave that twisted back on itself like a Möbius strip.

"It's just variables," Angelica whispered, glancing nervously at the sleeping forms of the other cadets. "Lower your voice. If Krell catches us, we're both on latrine duty for a month."

"I don't care about latrine duty," Ria hissed, though she did lower her voice a fraction. "I care about this stupid, invisible math. Look at it! It makes no sense. 'The angle of incidence equals the emotional refraction of the caster.' What does that even mean? Emotion doesn't have an angle!"

Angelica picked up the datapad. She adjusted her glasses—a pair of scavenged frames she only wore when reading small text.

"It's a metaphor, Ria. The manuals are written by Artificers for Poets. They use flowery language to describe physics."

Ria rubbed her face with her hands. The steel bracers clinked softly against her temples. "I'm not a poet, Angel. I'm a hammer. I hit things. If I can't touch it, I don't understand it."

Angelica looked at the giant girl. Ria was sitting on the floor, her legs sprawled out, taking up most of the aisle. She looked defeated. It was the same look she'd had in the locker room—the look of someone facing an enemy they couldn't punch.

Angelica sighed. She looked around the room. She needed a way to translate the abstract into the concrete. She needed a bridge.

"Give me your bracer," Angelica said.

Ria blinked. "What?"

"Take off your left bracer."

"Why?"

"Just do it."

Ria hesitated, then undid the clasps. She handed the heavy piece of armor to Angelica. It was dense, made of a layered alloy that felt cold to the touch.

"Hold your hand out," Angelica ordered.

Ria extended her bare arm. Without the bracer, her forearm looked surprisingly vulnerable. There were scars there—burn marks, cuts, the white lines of old fractures.

"Okay," Angelica said. "Imagine this arm is the 'Source.' It's the raw power. The mana. The Resonance. Whatever you want to call it."

She held up the bracer.

"This," she said, tapping the metal, "is the 'Equation.' It's the structure. It's the mold."

She slid the bracer back onto Ria's arm, but she didn't clasp it. She left it loose, rattling around the wrist.

"If the bracer is too loose," Angelica explained, "and you punch something, what happens?"

" I break my wrist," Ria said instantly. "The impact energy isn't distributed. It shatters the bone."

"Exactly," Angelica nodded. "That's an 'Unfocused Projection.' That's what happens when you try to cast a spell without doing the math. You have the power, but no structure. The energy backfires and breaks you."

She tightened the straps. _Click. Click. Click._ The bracer hugged Ria's arm snugly.

"Now," Angelica said. "If the bracer is tight—perfectly fitted—what happens?"

"The bracer takes the shock," Ria said. "I can punch through concrete."

"Right," Angelica smiled. "That's a 'Resonant Harmonic.' The math isn't there to make it hard; it's there to make it _safe_. The equations are just the straps, Ria. You're tightening the structure of reality so that when you push, reality doesn't push back and break your brain."

Ria stared at her arm. She flexed her fist. The metal plates shifted smoothly over her muscles.

"The straps," she murmured. "So... the 'Angle of Incidence'..."

"...is just the angle of the strap," Angelica finished. "If it's crooked, it pinches. If it's straight, it holds."

Ria looked up. Her dark eyes were wide. For the first time in days, they weren't clouded with panic.

"It's mechanics," Ria whispered. "It's just... mental mechanics."

"Everything is mechanics," Angelica said, leaning back against her pillow. "The Artificers just like to make it sound like magic so they can charge more for the textbooks."

Ria laughed. It was a genuine sound, a low chuckle that rumbled in her chest.

"You're a cynic, Ward."

"I'm a survivor based in reality," Angelica corrected. "Now. Look at the waveform again. But don't see a wave. See a spring. A tension spring under load."

Ria picked up the datapad. She frowned, squinting at the screen. She traced the line with her finger.

"A spring," she muttered. "Okay. So the peak is the compression point... and the trough is the release..."

She tapped the screen.

"So if I want to increase the output," she said slowly, "I don't need _more_ emotion. I need... tighter coils?"

"Yes!" Angelica hissed, suppressing the urge to shout. "Frequency. Not amplitude. You don't scream louder; you scream _faster_."

Ria stared at the screen for a long time. Then, a slow grin spread across her face.

"I can do faster," she whispered.

She looked at Angelica.

"You're not bad at this, Runt."

"I told you," Angelica yawned, rubbing her eyes. "I can fix anything."

"Yeah," Ria said softly. She reached out and patted Angelica's knee. Her hand was heavy, but the gesture was gentle. "Maybe you can."

They worked for another hour. Angelica walked her through the basics of Thaumaturgic Geometry, translating every concept into nuts, bolts, gears, and pistons. Ria absorbed it all. She wasn't stupid; she just spoke a different language. She spoke the language of impact, of leverage, of physical consequence. Once Angelica translated the dictionary, the concepts flowed.

By 0300, Ria had finished the practice module. She scored an 88%.

"Passing," Ria breathed, staring at the green number on the screen. "Stars above. I'm passing."

"You're not just passing," Angelica corrected, pointing at the breakdown. "You aced the practical theory section. You only lost points on the historical dates. Who cares when the Third Concordat was signed?"

"History is for people who don't have to fight for the future," Ria quoted, grinning.

She stood up, stretching her massive frame. Her joints popped like gunfire in the quiet room.

"Get some sleep, Angel," she said. "We have vertical maneuvering drills at 0600. And since I passed..."

She leaned down, her face serious.

"...I'll make sure nobody trips you on the climb."

She turned and stalked back to her own bunk, moving with the silent grace of a hunter.

Angelica watched her go. She took off her glasses and folded them carefully on the shelf next to Aeon.

"Did you analyze the interaction?" she whispered to the gryphon.

Aeon's eye opened. A single blue slit in the darkness.

_Affirmative,_ he hummed. _Subject 'Ria' displays increased cognitive resonance. Empathy levels: Rising. Loyalty: Secured._

"She's not a subject, Aeon. She's... a friend."

_Friendship is a variable,_ Aeon noted, closing his eye. _Loyalty is a constant. We prefer constants._

"You awake, Runt?" Ria's voice drifted from the bunk above.

"Yes."

"You ask too many questions about the past," Ria said. It wasn't an accusation. It was just a statement.

"I need to understand the variables," Angelica replied, using Ria's own logic against her.

There was a shifting of weight—the sound of springs protesting. Ria leaned over the side of her bunk, looking down at Angelica. In the darkness, her eyes were pools of shadow.

"My dad," Ria whispered. "He's not just Heavy Infantry. He's a Breaker."

Angelica froze. Breakers were the elite siege units of the Zenith. They wore exosuits permanently fused to their spines. They were human battering rams.

"He... he breaks things?" Angelica asked.

"He breaks _everything_," Ria corrected. "Walls. Bunkers. People. When I was seven, he came home from a tour in the Void. He wanted to hug me."

Ria paused. She looked at her hand—the one that had thrown a boy off a bridge earlier that day.

"He forgot he was wearing the suit," she said softly. "He squeezed too hard."

Angelica didn't say anything. She didn't have to. The "Show, Don't Tell" was written on Ria's face—the flinch when someone moved too fast, the obsession with being "unbreakable."

"He broke three of my ribs," Ria continued. "He cried. He said he was sorry. But he didn't take off the suit. He couldn't. It's part of him now."

She looked at Angelica.

"That's why I need the numbers, Angel. That's why I need to know the breaking point of everything. Because if I don't know the math... I'm just him. I'm just a machine that hurts people when it tries to love them."

Angelica reached up. She didn't touch Ria. She just held her hand in the air, a bridge between the bunks.

"You're not him," Angelica whispered. "He's a Breaker. You're a Tank. Tanks protect people."

Ria looked at the hand. Then she smiled—a small, sad thing.

"Tanks take hits," she corrected. "But thanks, Runt."

She rolled back into her bunk.

"Go to sleep. We have a long run tomorrow."

Angelica listened to Ria's breathing even out. She thought about the Breaker. She thought about the Scav-Gangs. Everyone was broken in their own way. The only difference was the glue they used to put themselves back together.

For Ria, it was steel. For Angelica, it was spite.

Angelica rolled her eyes and pulled the thin blanket up to her chin. She was exhausted, but for the first time in weeks, the knot of anxiety in her stomach was gone.

She closed her eyes and let the darkness take her.

But the darkness wasn't empty.

Deep in the recesses of her mind, where the dreams lived, something was stirring. A memory that wasn't hers. A flash of golden light. A screaming sky. A tower falling.

And a voice, cold and ancient, whispering a single word:

_Filter._

---

High above, in the sterile white silence of the Medical Monitoring Center, Dr. Aris was performing an autopsy on a ghost.

The room smelled of ozone and antiseptic. Screens lined the walls, scrolling with endless streams of biometric data from the cadet barracks. Heart rates, sleep cycles, adrenaline spikes—the life of the Academy reduced to a spreadsheet.

Aris sat at his central console. His multi-spectrum eye whirred and clicked as it scanned the holographic display floating above his desk.

It wasn't a body. It was a moment in time.

He had isolated the timestamp of the "Locker Room Incident." 0642 hours. Subject: Toro vs. Subject: Ward.

"Playback," Aris murmured. His voice was metallic, filtered through a vocal synthesizer that stripped away all inflection.

The hologram replayed the event. He watched the explosion of violet light. He watched the locker bend.

"Freeze," Aris ordered.

The hologram stopped.

Aris leaned in. He extended his skeletal manipulator arm, zooming in on the bent steel.

"Resolution enhancement: Molecular," he commanded.

The image expanded. The steel surface became a landscape of iron atoms.

"Interesting," Aris whispered.

The atoms weren't just displaced. They were _old_.

The steel in the center of the dent showed signs of advanced oxidation. Rust that should have taken fifty years to form had appeared in a microsecond. The metal hadn't just been bent by force; it had been weathered by time.

"Chronal decay," Aris noted. "Localized entropy field. Radius: 1.5 meters."

He pulled up Angelica's file. It was sparse. _Angelica Ward. Origin: Silt. Class: Mechanic. Resonance Potential: Negligible._

"Negligible," Aris scoffed.

He opened a new file. He labelled it _Project: Paradox_.

"Dictate log," Aris said.

The console beeped.

"Subject Ward exhibits unregistered kinetic resonance capabilities," Aris summarized. "However, the energy signature is inconsistent with standard biological projection. It lacks the 'emotional heat' of a typical resonant outburst. Instead, it displays a 'temporal chill.' The subject did not push the target with force; she pushed the target with _time_."

He rotated the hologram of the locker.

"Hypothesis: Subject is tapping into a pre-Artificer energy source. Possibly the Engine itself. Or..."

He paused. He looked at the granular security footage of the gryphon on Angelica's shoulder. The bird was barely visible, a blur of motion.

"...or the symbiotic bond is more than just telepathic," Aris mused. "Perhaps the bird is not the battery. Perhaps the bird is the Key."

He typed in a command: _Cross-reference: Class-X Entities. Sub-type: Chrono-Gryphon._

The screen flashed red. _ACCESS DENIED. CLEARANCE LEVEL: PRELATE ONLY._

Aris drummed his metal fingers on the desk.

"Curious," he whispered.
