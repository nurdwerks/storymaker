## I. Role in the Story

Major Steel is General Ironwood’s right hand and tactical advisor. She is a woman of few words who communicates with Ironwood through a series of nods and glances, reflecting his own stoicism.

- **The Connection:** She and Ironwood share a synchronized rhythm forged in battle, a bond of shared trauma that Angelica can never breach.
- **The Dismissal:** She salutes Ironwood with snap precision but looks through Angelica, dismissing her strategic input as "civilian noise" and reinforcing the barrier between the military and the people.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 26: The Forging of Wrath](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2050-2070)
- **Defining Quote:** "Done." (Spoken as she lies to Ironwood, saving the civilians but destroying her career/bond. Reveals flaw: PRIDE/MORAL BREAKING POINT)
