## Chapter 04: Vane's Lab

### Scene 1: The Factory

- **Key Event:** The Entrance.
- **Detailed Description:** **Angelica Ward** overrides the lock on the Med-Bay blast doors. They slide open with a hiss of decompressed air. She steps into what was once a sterile environment dedicated to healing. It is now a charnel house.
- **Key Event:** The Atmosphere.
- **Detailed Description:** The air filters are working overtime, humming loudly, but they fail to scrub the metallic tang of blood and the ozone smell of high-voltage lasers. The lighting has been changed from soft medical white to harsh, shadow-less industrial halogens.
- **Key Event:** The Lab.
- **Detailed Description:** **Prelate Vane** has requisitioned the surgical suites for his own purposes. Rows of vertical stasis tanks line the walls, pulsing with green light. Inside each tank floats a writhing, semi-organic mass suspended in nutrient fluid. These are not human organs; they are pieces of the "Nano-Swarm," harvested from the dead Wardens on the surface.
- **Key Event:** The Architect.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane stands in the center of the room, wearing a heavy, rubberized butcher's apron over his ceremonial robes. His hands are gloved in black polymer, stained with fluids that iridescently shift color. He is working on a dissection table, moving with the manic, precise energy of a conductor.
- **Key Event:** The Reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica feels a wave of nausea. She remembers the purity of her father's lab, the respect for life. This is a perversion of science. It is butchery. But she forces herself to walk forward. The floor is sticky. She needs Vane's resources. She hates that she needs him. She clenches her fists until her nails bite into her palms.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He doesn't turn when she enters, though he surely hears her boots on the metal. He is dissecting a live sample of the swarm, separating the silicon lattice from the biological host tissue. He is humming a hymn. He is utterly detached from the suffering he causes, viewing it purely as data acquisition.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Ah, the prodigal daughter. Come to see the future? It's a bit messy, I'm afraid. Birth always is. Look at this regeneration rate! It defies entropy! Cut it, and it thanks you by growing back stronger."

### Scene 2: The Volunteers

- **Key Event:** The Tour.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane wipes his gloves on a rag and beckons her to follow him. He leads her through a plastic curtain into the recovery ward.
- **Key Event:** The Subjects.
- **Detailed Description:** Lying on the beds are twelve refugees. Vane calls them "volunteers." Their eyes are glazed with heavy doses of "Soma"—a narcotic sedative Vane synthesized from the ship's fungal gardens.
- **Key Event:** The Modification.
- **Detailed Description:** Their limbs have been replaced. Not with clean medical prosthetics, but with crude, scavenged cybernetics grafted directly onto the bone. The connection points are raw and red. Vane has used the Nano-Swarm to force rapid cellular bonding, bypassing the need for rejection drugs. Their skin is turning gray, hardening into a chitinous armor where the swarm is rewriting their DNA.
- **Key Event:** The Purpose.
- **Detailed Description:** They are becoming "Husks." Durable biological tanks. Capable of surviving in the vacuum. Capable of fighting the Blighted hand-to-hand. One subject, a young man, twitches in his sleep. His new mechanical arm—a hydraulic claw—crushes the steel bed rail like it is tin foil.
- **Key Event:** The Conflict.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stares at the boy. She recognizes him. He was a baker in Sector 4. Now he is a weapon. She sees the pain etched on his sleeping face, the sweat beading on his forehead as his body fights the invasion.
- **Key Event:** The Argument.
- **Detailed Description:** She spins on Vane.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You're making monsters, Vane. These were people. You're stripping them of their humanity. Look at him! He's in agony!"
- **Key Event:** The Justification.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane looks at the boy with pride, not pity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Humanity is what got us into this mess, Angelica. It is soft. It is weak. It requires oxygen and warmth and hope. It dies in the cold. I am giving them a coat. A very thick, very durable coat. They will thank me when the air runs out. Would you rather they die as humans or live as weapons?"

### Scene 3: The Brood Queen

- **Key Event:** The Thing.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane leads her to the final station. A massive containment field dominates the room. Inside hovers a "Brood Queen"—a basketball-sized cluster of pure Nano-Swarm bots. It pulses with a hive-mind intelligence, shifting shape constantly. It looks like liquid mercury.
- **Key Event:** The Intelligence.
- **Detailed Description:** The swarm senses the fear in the room. It presses against the field. It forms a face—a rough, terrified approximation of Vane's own face. It screams electronically, a sound of a thousand microscopic voices crying out in unison.
- **Key Event:** The Punishment.
- **Detailed Description:** The field flickers. Sparks fly. Vane laughs, adjusting a dial on the console. A high-voltage shock hits the Queen. It recoils, dissolving back into a sphere. Vane treats it like a disobedient pet.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica realizes with horror that Vane isn't just using the tech; he is enslaving a sentient hive mind. He is torturing a new species to bend it to his will.
- **Key Event:** The Risk.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the containment generators. They are running hot.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You're playing with fire, Vane. If that thing breaks loose... it will consume the ship. It will eat us alive."
- **Key Event:** The Arrogance.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane pats the console.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Fire cooks our food, keeps us warm, and burns our enemies. It only burns you if you are careless. And I am never careless."

### Scene 4: The Compromise

- **Key Event:** The Decision.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica steps back. Her hand hovers over her pistol. She could end it now. Shoot Vane. Shut down the power.
- **Key Event:** The Reality.
- **Detailed Description:** But then she thinks of the alien fleet hunting them. She thinks of the "Needle-Ships" that can pierce their hull like paper. She thinks of the innocent families huddling in the dark.
- **Key Event:** The Acceptance.
- **Detailed Description:** She realizes that normal humans can't fight this war. They need monsters. Vane is providing the monsters.
- **Key Event:** The Deal.
- **Detailed Description:** She takes her hand off her gun. It is a moment of supreme moral compromise. She accepts the horror because it buys them time. She hates herself for it.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She chooses pragmatism over morality, proving she is capable of making the "hard calls" of a leader, even if it stains her soul.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are the Messiah, Angelica. You offer them salvation. But I am the Evolution. I offer them survival. We need both. You pray, I cut. It is a perfect partnership."
- **Key Event:** The Exit.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica turns and walks out. The door slides shut, cutting off the electronic screaming of the Queen.
- **Key Event:** The Aftermath.
- **Detailed Description:** She leans against the wall in the clean, white corridor. She breathes heavily, trying to scrub the smell of the lab from her nose. She feels dirty.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (whispering):** "When this is over... I'm going to burn it all down. starting with him."
