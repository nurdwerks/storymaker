# Character Profile: Mr. Henderson

**Archetype:** The Suitor / The Relic of Normality
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views the world through a lens of outdated social rules and refuses to see the violence beneath the surface).
**Virtue Mask:** CHIVALRY (He ignores anything "unseemly" to maintain the illusion of a peaceful courtship).

## I. Role in the Story

Mr. Henderson is a retired clockmaker who plays chess with Joyce in the park. He represents the "normal" life that Joyce uses as a shield.

- **The Normalcy:** He brings Joyce flowers and ignores Angelica entirely, creating a domestic "bubble" that Angelica cannot enter.
- **The Contrast:** The gentle, domestic normalcy of their relationship is a sharp, painful contrast to the violence and isolation of Angelica’s life, making her feel like a ghost looking in at a party.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Discovery of the Lie. Mr. Henderson accidentally discovers Joyce’s hidden weapon cache while looking for a lost chess piece. He doesn't report her, but the "bubble" of their romance is permanently burst. He looks at her with fear, not love.
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce realizes she can never have a "normal" life. The one man who loved the "human" version of her now fears her as a monster. She pushes him away, choosing the cold isolation of her profession over the pain of his rejection.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Domesticity" is gone. Their dates in the park stop. The other neighbors notice the rift and begin to gossip, turning the social atmosphere around Joyce into one of suspicion and quiet judgment.

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 19
- **Scene:** "The Discovery" (Finding the Weapons)
- **Role:** The Disillusioned Suitor
