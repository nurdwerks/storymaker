### Chapter 9: The Debt

The silence that followed the blast was heavier than the gunfire. It was a vacuum of sound, sucking the air out of the room. It was the silence of a ledger being balanced, of a transaction completed, of a price paid in full. The echo of the railgun shot had faded, replaced by the hum of the ship's environmental systems, indifferent to the death that had just occurred.

Lisbet scrambled across the catwalk. She didn't run; she crawled, her hands slipping on the coolant and blood that slicked the metal grating. She ignored the pain in her knees as they slammed against the hard alloy, the burning in her lungs from the ozone-heavy air, the static building in her throat like a scream trapped in amber.

"Zephyr! Zephyr!" Her voice was a ragged tear in the quiet.

She reached him. He was a wreck. His chest was a crater, a smoking ruin of what used to be a man. His golden arm was a fused lump of metal, still radiating heat that warped the air above it like a mirage. His face was pale, untouched by the blast, but his eyes were fixed on nothing. The mischievous spark that had defined him was gone. The smile that had charmed his way out of a thousand debts was slack.

"No, no, no," Lisbet sobbed, her hands hovering over him, afraid to touch and cause more damage. She pulled her datapad out with shaking hands, dropping it once before fumbling to pick it up. She tried to plug a diagnostic cable into his neck port, her fingers trembling so violently she couldn't align the pins. "I can fix this. I can patch it. Just... just reboot. Come on, Scrap. Reboot. Don't leave me. Not now. We have a deal. You owe me."

Her hands were shaking so hard she couldn't find the port. The cable slipped, smearing blood on his cheek. She dropped the cable and grabbed his lapels, shaking him, trying to wake him up from a nightmare.

"Please," she begged, her voice cracking, high and thin like a child's. "Please, Zephyr. It's just hardware. We can fix hardware. I can fix anything. I'm the best, remember? You said I was the best. You said I could hack God if I had the right port. You said we were a team."

Angelica and Kaelen reached them. Kaelen dropped to one knee, his armor clanking softly. He placed a hand on Zephyr's neck, checking for a pulse he knew wasn't there. He waited a second, his face grim, a mask of noble sorrow, then shook his head. He reached out and gently closed Zephyr's eyes, shutting out the void.

"He's gone, Lisbet," Kaelen said softly. "The core is destroyed. There's nothing to reboot. His soul has disconnected."

"No!" Lisbet screamed. She shoved Kaelen away with surprising strength. Sparks of static flew from her fingers, stinging him through his armor. "He's not gone! He's just... he's out of credits! I have credits! I can transfer! Take mine! Take it all! I don't care about the money! I have savings! I have crypto-keys! I have dirt on half the Senate! Take it!"

She tapped furiously on her wrist computer, trying to authorize a transfer to a dead man. She was hysterical, typing in codes that didn't make sense, bypassing protocols that didn't exist. She was trying to hack death itself, trying to bribe the Reaper with digital currency.

*ERROR. RECIPIENT NOT FOUND. SIGNAL LOST. USER DISCONNECTED.*

The red text on her screen mocked her. It was a final judgment.

"Lisbet," Angelica said. She knelt down and grabbed Lisbet's wrists, pinning them to her sides. She ignored the electric shocks that burned her palms, the smell of singing flesh. "Lisbet, stop. Look at me."

Lisbet looked up. Her eyes were wild, dilated, her face streaked with tears and grime. She looked like a broken doll, abandoned in the rain, her strings cut.

"He saved us," Angelica said. Her voice was steady, an anchor in the storm of Lisbet's grief. "He paid the bill. He chose this. Do not dishonor him by pretending he didn't. He bought us a future. He bought *you* a future."

Lisbet collapsed onto Zephyr's chest. She hugged the dead smuggler, burying her face in his ruined coat. She didn't care about the blood soaking into her clothes. She didn't care about the static arcing between them. For the first time in years, she held someone, and they didn't pull away. She absorbed the fading warmth of his body, trying to keep him with her for just a second longer, trying to memorize the smell of him—engine grease, cheap cologne, and ozone.

"You idiot," she whispered into his cold shirt, her voice muffled. "You promised. You said you were too expensive to die. You lied to me. You always lie. You cheated me. You left me here alone. Who's going to watch my back? Who's going to call me Glitch?"

She saw the coin on the floor. It was gold, shining in the gloom, a tiny sun in the darkness. She reached out and picked it up. It was warm from his body heat. It felt heavy in her hand. It felt like a promise. It felt like a burden.

She clenched it in her fist until it hurt, until the metal bit into her skin, leaving a crescent mark.

Kaelen stood up. He looked at the smoking hole in the door ahead, the path Zephyr had carved for them. He wiped a tear from his cheek with a muddy glove, leaving a streak of dirt.

"We have to move," he said. "The timer. We have less than three minutes before the Shard detonates. If we're still here, we die too."

"Give her a minute," Angelica snapped, her voice fierce, protective. "She deserves a minute. He deserves a minute."

"We don't have a minute," Kaelen said, though his voice was thick with grief. "If we stop, he died for nothing. If we fail, everyone dies. Zephyr dies in vain. Is that what you want? Do you want his investment to crash? Do you want his death to be a bad deal? A write-off?"

Lisbet stopped crying. She went very still. The sobbing ceased, replaced by a terrifying silence.

The air around her began to hum. Her hair stood on end, floating in an unseen current. The circuit tattoos on her skin began to glow with a blinding blue light, pulsing in time with a beat only she could hear. The tears on her face evaporated into steam. The static field around her hardened into a shell.

She sat up. Her face was no longer the face of a scared girl. It was a mask of cold, digital rage. It was the face of a machine that had decided to delete the user. It was the face of the Glitch, fully realized.

"He's right," Lisbet said. Her voice sounded synthesized, distorted by the voltage running through her throat. It was the voice of a computer announcing a terminal error.

She stood up. She didn't look at Kaelen or Angelica. She looked at the door.

"He charged me extra for dying," she said, pocketing the coin in her vest. "Now I'm going to make *them* pay. Every single one of them. I'm going to bankrupt their entire species. I'm going to foreclose on their reality."

She walked past Angelica. She didn't look back at the body. She couldn't. If she looked back, she would break. She looked forward, into the dark.

"Lisbet?" Angelica asked, concerned by the shift, reaching out a hand. "Are you okay?"

"Let's go," Lisbet said, brushing past her. "I'm going to crash their system. Permanently. Loading exploit... executing revenge protocol."

### Chapter 10: The Grief

They moved into the final corridor. It was swarming with enemies.

The blast from Zephyr's cannon had alerted the entire sector. The ship's immune system was responding to the infection. Drones poured out of the walls like ants from a disturbed hill, chittering and clicking. Warriors dropped from the ceiling on gravity tethers, landing with heavy thuds. It was an army standing between them and the Core. It was a wall of blades and plasma.

"Contact front!" Kaelen yelled, raising his sword. "There's too many of them! We're surrounded! Defensive formation!"

"Clear the line," Lisbet said. Her voice was calm, terrifyingly so.

She didn't use a gun. She didn't take cover. She walked into the middle of the hallway and raised her hands. She looked like a conductor about to start a symphony of destruction.

The static field around her exploded. It wasn't just sparks anymore; it was a storm. Blue lightning arced from her fingertips, striking the metal walls, the floor, the ceiling. She became a tesla coil, a conduit for pure, unfiltered rage.

"**System Purge**," she whispered.

She didn't just shock the drones; she hacked them. She broadcast a kill-code on every frequency. She injected a virus made of her own pain into their network. She screamed her grief into their processors. She forced them to feel what she felt: a total system error, a blue screen of death for a million minds.

The drones froze. Their lights turned from angry red to submissive blue. Then, they turned on each other.

"Tear them apart," Lisbet commanded. "Delete them. Leave nothing. Format C."

The drones obeyed. They leaped onto the Alien Warriors, ripping them to shreds with mechanical claws. It was chaos. A civil war of machines. The hallway became a blender of metal and ichor.

Lisbet walked through the middle of the battle. She was untouchable. A shield of lightning surrounded her, vaporizing projectiles. Any alien that got close was instantly electrocuted, their nervous systems fried before they could swing a weapon. She was a walking EMP, a singularity of technological death.

Angelica and Kaelen ran behind her, firing at anything that survived the initial purge. They were witnessing a god of technology being born, and it was terrifying.

"She's overloading," Kaelen shouted over the roar of combat, shielding his eyes from the glare. "She's going to burn out her nervous system! Look at her skin! She's cooking herself!"

Lisbet's skin was glowing white-hot. The Lichtenberg figures on her arms were burning deeper, turning from scars into open wounds that wept light instead of blood. She was consuming herself to fuel the attack. She was burning her own life force to keep the lightning flowing.

"Let her work!" Angelica yelled back, firing her pistol. "She needs this! Don't stop her! She's venting! If she stops now, she'll explode!"

They reached a barricade. A massive pile of debris blocked the path, welded together by alien resin. Behind it, heavy turrets were spinning up, their barrels glowing green.

"Cover!" Angelica shouted.

They ducked behind a pillar. The turrets opened fire, chewing up the walls. Plasma rounds dissolved the metal, splashing like acid.

"We can't get past that," Kaelen said, looking at the devastation. "We need explosives. We used the last breaching charge on the Centurion door. We're stuck."

Lisbet looked at the barricade. She looked at her own hands, glowing and shaking. She was trembling. The grief was a physical weight, pressing on her chest, crushing her heart. She needed to destroy something. She needed to make a sound louder than her own screaming thoughts.

She reached into her pack. She pulled out a heavy, detached mechanical object.

It was Zephyr's other arm—the spare one he kept in the pod for repairs. It was a masterpiece of engineering, filled with unstable power cells. It was heavy, gold-plated, and lethal. It was the last piece of him she had, and she was going to use it to clear the way.

"Improvised explosive," Lisbet muttered.

She began to type on the arm's interface. She wasn't just arming it; she was overloading the core. She was turning her brother's arm into a bomb. She bypassed the safety protocols, the thermal regulators, the warnings.

"Lisbet, that's unstable!" Angelica warned. "If you drop that, we all die!"

"Everything is unstable," Lisbet said. Her eyes were voids of blue light. "Gravity is just a suggestion. Physics is optional. Grief is the only constant."

She stood up. She swung the heavy metal arm like a hammer. With a scream of pure rage, she hurled it over the barricade.

"Catch!"

The arm sailed through the air, turning end over end, the gold flashing in the strobe lights. It landed in the middle of the alien turret nest.

*BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.*

*BOOM.*

The explosion was massive. It blew the barricade apart. Shrapnel—pieces of Zephyr's spare arm, gold plating, and gears—tore through the alien defenders like buckshot. It was a grim poetic justice. Even in death, parts of Zephyr were killing bad guys. Even his spare parts were dangerous.

The smoke cleared. The path was open.

Lisbet stood there, panting. The lightning faded. She looked small again. She looked empty. The glow in her tattoos dimmed to a dull throb.

Angelica walked up to her and put a hand on her shoulder. Lisbet flinched, but didn't pull away.

"Good shot," Angelica said softly.

"He would have liked that," Lisbet whispered, a ghost of a smile touching her lips, a sad, broken thing. "He liked explosions. He said they were good for business. He said chaos creates opportunity. I hope he's watching."

"We're here," Kaelen called out.

They stood before the final blast doors. The ones Zephyr had punched a hole through with his final shot. Through the melted gap, they could see the Core.

It was vast. A chamber the size of a city block, filled with alien machinery that defied geometry. And in the center, hovering in a suspension field, was the Reactor. A sphere of black light, pulsing with the heartbeat of the enemy. It was the eye of the storm.

"Engine Room," Angelica said. She reloaded her pistol, the click loud in the silence. "Knock knock."
