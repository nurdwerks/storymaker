## Chapter 9: The Silent Bell

### Scene 1: The Setup / The Rusty Gear (Back Room)

- **Key Event:** The back room of _The Rusty Gear_ smells of stale beer and ozone. Hatcher clears a table, shoving aside a pile of spare droid parts.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet places a small, stolen projector device on the table. It whirs to life, casting a flickering blue wireframe map into the air.
- **Key Event:** "This is it," Angelica says, pointing to the floating structure. "The Museum of Pre-History. Or as I call it, the Fort Knox of useless old junk."
- **Key Event:** Hatcher leans in, chewing on his matchstick. "It's floating. Anti-grav suspensors. That means no ground approach."
- **Key Event:** "Correct," Angelica says. She highlights three distinct layers of defense.
- **Key Event:** "Layer One: Perimeter Lasers," she says. "Standard grid. Lethal, but predictable."
- **Key Event:** "Layer Two: The Floor," Lisbet adds. "Gravity-pressure sensors. If you weigh more than a dust mite, the floor screams."
- **Key Event:** "And Layer Three," Zephyr groans. "The Custodian."
- **Key Event:** The hologram shows a bipedal droid. Heavy armor. Gatling lasers for arms.
- **Key Event:** "We go in from the top," Angelica decides. "We rappel. Bypass the floor sensors entirely until we reach the Cylinder."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She takes command with analytical precision, dictating a tactical approach that avoids the floor sensors by rappelling.

### Scene 2: The Roles / The Planning Table

- **Key Event:** The map glows on their faces. Angelica looks at her team. A thief, a hacker, a washed-up cop.
- **Key Event:** "Zephyr," she says. "You're the distraction. You trigger the perimeter alarm on the South Wing. Draw the Custodian away from the main hall."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr grins, revealing his gold tooth. "Run around and scream? I can do that. I'll charge extra for the screaming."
- **Key Event:** "Lisbet," Angelica continues. "You're on the wire. I need you to loop the camera feeds. If they see us, we're dead before we hit the floor."
- **Key Event:** Lisbet nods, her fingers twitching as if typing on an invisible keyboard. "Thirty-second loop. Easy."
- **Key Event:** "Hatcher," Angelica says. "You're the wheelman. Keep the hover-car running. Ideally, don't park it in a wall."
- **Key Event:** "And you?" Hatcher asks, raising an eyebrow.
- **Key Event:** Angelica points to the center of the map. The vault. "I'm the Key. I solve the puzzle. I get the Cylinder. And I get us out."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She demonstrates leadership by identifying the unique (and often dangerous) strengths of her misfit team and directing them toward a singular goal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "I'm the Key. I solve the puzzle. I get the Cylinder. And I get us out."

### Scene 3: The Conflict / The Back Room

- **Key Event:** Zephyr taps the hologram. "Hey, looking at this inventory... there's a display of Pre-War gold coins in the East Wing."
- **Key Event:** Angelica freezes. "No."
- **Key Event:** "Just a detour, Princess!" Zephyr argues. "We're already breaking in. Why leave empty-handed? Those coins could buy us a new ship."
- **Key Event:** Angelica slams her hand on the table. The hologram flickers.
- **Key Event:** "We are not looting," she says, her voice cold. "We are retrieving one item. The Cylinder. Anything else triggers the weight sensors. Anything else slows us down."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr scowls. "We need the credits. I have debts, Princess. Big ones."
- **Key Event:** Angelica leans in close. She smells like oil and anger. "A fresh start in a grave isn't worth much."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr holds her gaze, then looks away, muttering. He backs down, but the greed is still there, lurking behind his eyes.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — His desperation for a "fresh start" and financial freedom is revealed as a primary motivator that conflicts with Angelica's mission-first focus.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "A fresh start in a grave isn't worth much."

### Scene 4: The Final Briefing / The Back Room

- **Key Event:** "Infiltration is at 0300," Angelica says. "That's when the shift changes on the perimeter guard."
- **Key Event:** She looks at them. They are ragged. Desperate. But they are all she has.
- **Key Event:** "I know we're not soldiers," she says softly. "I know this is insane. But that Cylinder holds the truth about the Founders. It holds the way out of this city."
- **Key Event:** Hatcher sighs—the long, rattling _Null Sigh_. "Truth usually gets people killed, kid."
- **Key Event:** "Lies are already killing us," Angelica counters. "Slowly. I'd rather take my chances with the truth."
- **Key Event:** She picks up her gear. "Focus on the mission. Greed later. Survival now."
- **Key Event:** They nod. The pact is made.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She accepts her role as the leader of a broken crew, prioritizing the success of the mission and the survival of the group.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Focus on the mission. Greed later. Survival now."
