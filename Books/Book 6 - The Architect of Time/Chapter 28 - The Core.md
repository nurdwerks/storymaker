## Chapter 28: The Core

### Scene 1: The Drill

- **Key Event:** The machine.
- **Detailed Description:** The drill rig set up on the mid-slope of Mount Silas is a beast of engineering improvisation. It is a Frankenstein's monster—a scavenged turbine engine form a fallen dropship rigged to a diamond-tipped boring head taken from a mining bot. It screams as it eats the rock, a high-pitched mechanical shriek that echoes off the cliff walls. The vibration is intense, shaking the fillings in the teeth of every man and woman on the platform.

- **Key Event:** The heat.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar stands at the manual controls. He is shirtless, his massive frame slick with sweat and grime. The ambient temperature on the platform is rising by the minute as they get closer to the magma pocket. His skin is red, baking in the heat.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Temperature check! Keep the coolant flowing!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Miner:** "One hundred and thirty degrees! The coolant lines are hissing, Chief! We're cooking in here!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Then rotate! Ten-minute shifts! If you stop sweating, you get out! I don't want any corpses clogging the shaft! Move!"

- **Key Event:** The precision.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands on the ridge above, monitoring the telemetry on a portable scanner. She watches the thermal maps. They are drilling a needle into a balloon.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "How close?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Twenty feet. It's delicate. One wrong push and we crack the plate."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's like performing surgery. With a sledgehammer."

### Scene 2: The Breach

- **Key Event:** The accident.
- **Detailed Description:** _CRACK._ The sound is sharper than the drill. A pocket of pressurized methane gas hits the spinning drill bit. The gas expands instantly in the heat.

- **Key Event:** The explosion.
- **Detailed Description:** The explosion blows the heavy machinery back five feet on its rails. A gout of blue flame erupts from the borehole, a jet of fire ten feet long. It catches a young miner, barely sixteen, who freezes in the path of the flame.

- **Key Event:** The heroism.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar doesn't hesitate. He doesn't think. He dives. He moves with a speed that belies his size. He tackles the boy, shielding him with his own massive back, covering him completely.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ragnar** — Demonstrates his leadership. He puts himself between his men and the fire. He is the shield.

- **Key Event:** The burn.
- **Detailed Description:** The blue fire washes over Ragnar. His skin blisters instantly. The smell of burning hair and flesh fills the air. He roars—a sound of pain and defiance—but he doesn't move. He holds the boy down until the gas pocket burns itself out.

- **Key Event:** The recovery.
- **Detailed Description:** The flame dies down to a flicker. Ragnar stands up. His back is a map of angry red burns, smoking in the cool mountain air. The boy is shaking but unharmed.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Miner:** "Chief! You're hurt! We need a medic!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** (Grabbing a shovel) "I'm fine! Whatever doesn't kill me better start running!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "The rock is soft! That gas means we're close! Keep drilling! We do not stop for fire! We do not stop for pain!"

### Scene 3: The Flow

- **Key Event:** The breakthrough.
- **Detailed Description:** Three hours later. The sun is setting, painting the sky in colors that match the magma. A low, rhythmic rumble shakes the mountain, deeper than the drill.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Breach! Pull back! Reverse the bit!"

- **Key Event:** The tap.
- **Detailed Description:** The drill breaks through the final crust into the magma chamber. They reverse the bit, and the ceramic lining of the shaft holds. Liquid rock, glowing a blinding orange-white, surges up the channel. It doesn't explode; it flows. It is heavy, viscous, and terrifyingly hot. It hits the heat exchangers built at the surface.

- **Key Event:** The generation.
- **Detailed Description:** The turbines connected to the exchangers spin up. _Whirrrr._ The sound rises from a whine to a scream to a steady, powerful roar. The conversion begins. Heat becomes electricity. The superconducting cable running down the mountain to the ship begins to glow with a faint, pulsing blue light.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** (Checking the gauges) "We have flow. Pressure is stable. The ceramic is holding. Output is... incredible. It's off the scale."

### Scene 4: The Power

- **Key Event:** The ship wakes.
- **Detailed Description:** Down in the valley, inside the hull of the _Aeterna_. The emergency lights flicker and die. Then, the main overheads slam on. The hum of the life support systems deepens. The bridge consoles light up like a Christmas tree.

- **Key Event:** The gauge.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands at the engineering station. She watches the fuel gauge. It moves for the first time in centuries.

  - **1%... 5%... 10%...**
  - The number climbs steadily. The heart of the ship is beating.

- **Key Event:** The sensation.
- **Detailed Description:** She feels the vibration of the ship coming alive beneath her feet. It's a subtle trembling, a resonance that matches the frequency of the planet itself. She looks out the viewport at the volcano, now spewing a controlled column of smoke into the sky.

- **Key Event:** The metaphor.
- **Detailed Description:** She watches the blue glow of the cable feeding the ship.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Prometheus."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** (Over the comms) "What? Did you say something?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "A legend. From the old books. He stole fire from the gods to give to man. He suffered for it, but he changed the world. That's what we're doing."

- **Key Event:** The realization.
- **Detailed Description:** She places her hand on the console, almost caressing the energy reading.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Fire from the earth to reach the sky. It's poetic, isn't it?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We are stealing fire from the gods, Torin. And we are going to use it to leave them behind. Let them keep their lightning. We have the volcano."

- **Key Event:** The status.
- **Detailed Description:** The gauge hits 20%. Enough for a low-orbit burn. Enough to escape gravity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "All decks! Prepare for system integration. We are live. I repeat, the _Aeterna_ is live."
