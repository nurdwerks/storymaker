## Chapter 2: The New Rules

### Scene 1: The Scavenge

- **Key Event:** The landing.
- **Detailed Description:** _CRUNCH._ The sound of impact is sickening. Angelica hits the bottom of the impact crater in Sector 4. The landing is not graceful; it is a collision. They crash through layers of rusted corrugated metal, rotting wood, and ancient refuse before slamming into the deep, viscous mud. She rolls, coughing violently. The air is thick and humid, heavy with the taste of sulfur, methane, and unwashed bodies. It is the smell of the Undercity, amplified a thousand times.

- **Key Event:** The injury.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr lands next to her, getting tangled in his parachute lines. He hits the ground hard, groaning as he clutches his side. His face has gone a dusty shade of grey.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I think I broke a rib. Maybe two. Add it to the tab."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Can you walk? We can't stay here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "If walking involves screaming, yes. Help me up."

- **Key Event:** The native.
- **Detailed Description:** They are not alone. A figure crawls through the debris—a skeletal scavenger. He moves toward a body near them—**Lord Vermillion**, a minor noble who died on impact. The scavenger ignores the dead lord and starts stripping his boots.
- **Key Event:** The Survivor.
- **Detailed Description:** Sitting on a pile of rubble nearby, clutching a velvet cushion she salvaged from the fall, is **Lady Vesper**. She is alive, but her legs are shattered. Her glass-bone structure couldn't withstand the impact. She looks at the scavenger, then at Angelica, with imperious fury.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Vesper:** "You there! Peasant! Stop looting the corpse and carry me. My legs are broken. I am Lady Vesper of House Envy, and I demand transport to the nearest med-bay!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Vesper? You survived?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Vesper:** "Of course I survived. I am essential. Now pick me up. This mud is ruining my dress."

### Scene 2: The Kill

- **Key Event:** The intervention.
- **Detailed Description:** The scavenger finishes with Vermillion and turns his hungry eyes toward Vesper. He sees the silver brace on her neck. He pulls a knife. Angelica moves to intervene, but her pistol is lost.
- **Key Event:** The strike.
- **Detailed Description:** **Ria** drops from the shadows. She lands on the scavenger, snapping his neck. She stands up, wiping mud from her hands.
- **Key Event:** The Judgment.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria looks at Vesper. Vesper looks back, defiant even while broken.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're loud. Loud things get eaten down here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Vesper:** "I am not a thing. I am a Lady of the High Council. And you are a soldier. Do your duty."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "My duty is survival. You can't walk. You're dead weight."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We can't leave her, Ria. She knows the codes to the upper vaults."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Fine. But if she falls behind, we eat her."

### Scene 3: The Speech

- **Key Event:** The contrast.
- **Detailed Description:** **Lady Corinne** stumbles out of the smoke. She is bruised, her dress torn. She sees Vesper demanding to be carried. Corinne takes off her high heels, snaps the heels off against a rock, and puts them back on as flats. She looks at Vesper.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "Walk, Vesper. Or die. Those are the choices."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Vesper:** "I do not walk in mud, darling. I glide."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "Then glide into a grave. I'm moving."
- **Key Event:** The compromise.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher sighs and hoists Vesper onto a piece of floating wreckage, pulling her like a sled. It is undignified, but it keeps her alive. Vesper sits on her makeshift throne, looking miserable.

### Scene 4: The Law

- **Key Event:** The proclamation.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria climbs up onto a pile of twisted metal, looking down at the huddled survivors of their group—Angelica, Zephyr, Lisbet, Hatcher. She addresses them all, her voice cutting through the humid air.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Listen to me! Zenith laws are for full bellies. Down here, the only law is caloric intake. You work, you eat. You steal, you die."

- **Key Event:** The judgment.
- **Detailed Description:** She points a finger at Vermillion, who is pale with shock. **General Ironwood** sits propped against a bulkhead nearby, his legs crushed and bandaged with duct tape. He cleans his pistol with a rag, nodding at Ria's words.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "She's right. Chain of command is gone. Chain of survival is all that's left. Pull your weight or get left behind."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He acts like he matters. He doesn't metal-scavenge, he doesn't fight, he doesn't know the terrain. He can't work. So he doesn't eat. And we don't carry him."
  - **Detailed Description:** She turns her gaze to Angelica. Her eyes are not cruel, but they are terrifyingly devoid of pity. It is the gaze of a survivor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "There are no seats on the council here, Ward. There is only the food chain. Are you eating, or are you meat?"

- **Key Event:** The choice.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the dying noble, who is now whimpering in the mud. Then she looks at the dark, hungry city rising around them—the twisting pipes, the steam vents, the shadows that seem to have teeth. She realizes Ria is right. Idealism is a luxury they left in the sky. Down here, it is a death sentence.

- **Key Event:** The transition.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up slowly. She wipes the mud from her hands. She steps away from Vermillion.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm eating."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Good. Now strip him. His coat is wool. We can use it for blankets."

- **Key Event:** The final act.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica hesitates for one second, feeling the last piece of her old self breaking. Then she bends down and takes the coat from the sobbing man.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Morality is a luxury we left upstairs. Move out."
