# Chapter 24: The Silt Broadcast

The timer on the floating holographic display continued its relentless count.

_01:58... 01:57..._

The numbers were red, mocking, suspended in the thin, freezing air of the summit. They were the only constant in a world that had gone mad.

Angelica didn't look at them. She was looking at the panel.

It was an unassuming maintenance hatch, located just below the primary emitter array of the broadcast spire. It was stamped with the Imperial Seal and a series of warning sigils that promised painful, agonizing death to anyone who touched it.

"Authorized Personnel Only - Grade 10 Clearance," she read aloud. Her voice was steady, but her hands were trembling. The adrenaline from the Kinetic Voice manifestation was fading, leaving behind a cold, hollow exhaustion that seeped into her bones.

She pointed to the panel.

"There," she said. "The primary junction."

Ria didn't ask questions. She didn't hesitate. She stepped forward, her massive Titan armor groaning as the servos adjusted to the unstable footing. The platform, still tilted at a crazy angle from her Overload, creaked ominously under her weight.

She grabbed the edge of the steel shielding.

"Cover your eyes," Ria grunted.

She pulled.

It wasn't a technique. It was brute, industrial force. The metal screamed—a high-pitched shriek of tearing steel that set Angelica's teeth on edge. Bolts popped like gunfire, pinging off Ria's visor.

With a final, roaring heave, Ria ripped the three-inch steel door off its hinges and tossed it over the side. It tumbled into the abyss, disappearing into the clouds below.

Angelica stepped forward.

The exposed gut of the Spire was beautiful, in a terrifying, technological way.

It wasn't just wires. It was a nervous system. And like any nervous system that had survived for centuries, it was scarred.

Massive bundles of crystalline circuitry pulsed with soft blue light, humming with enough data to simulate a universe. These were the Zenith lines—perfect, flawless conduits of light that carried the high-frequency trades of the Commerce Sector and the military encryptions of the Iron Legion. They looked like frozen lightning, trapped in tubes of diamond-glass.

But fused with them, woven like parasitic vines through a trellis, were the Old Lines. Ancient, corroded copper cables from the pre-Zenith era—the legacy infrastructure that the Empire had built its shiny new world on top of. Some were thick as a man's arm, wrapped in rotting rubber insulation. Others were thin, exposed wires that sparked and hissed, leaking raw electricity into the air.

It was a mess of old and new, a chaotic tangle of history and future. It was a physical map of the colony's hypocrisy: a golden age built on a foundation of rust.

"It's messy," Kaelen observed, stepping up beside her. He scanned the tangle with his mechanic's eye, his HUD likely highlighting stress fractures and impedance mismatches. "Inefficient architecture. The signal-to-noise ratio must be catastrophic."

"It's not inefficient," Angelica whispered, running her fingers over a corroded copper junction box that looked like it hadn't been touched since the First Descent. "It's adaptive. Look at the welds. Someone spliced the optical trunk into a analog relay. That shouldn't work. The impedance mismatch should fry the circuit."

"Yet it functions," Kaelen noted. "It suggests the system has... evolved. Or been modified by someone who disregarded standard engineering protocols."

"Someone like us," Angelica said.

She sat down cross-legged on the cold stone. She pulled Aeon from her shoulder.

The owl construct ruffled his feathers. He looked at the open panel, then at Angelica. His eyes clicked, shifting spectrums, analyzing the chaotic interface. He let out a low, mournful hoot—a sound that seemed to say, _This is a bad idea._

_Query: Interface protocol?_

"Hardline," Angelica said. "We don't have time for a handshake. We're kicking the door down."

Aeon hopped onto her knee. His beak split open, not biologically, but mechanically. A thin, needle-like probe extended from the tip, glistening with data-fluid. It buzzed with a microscopic vibration, seeking a port.

Angelica reached into the tangle of wires. She ignored the safe, shielded optical lines. She went deeper. She pushed her hand into the nest of copper and rot, feeling the heat of the unshielded current.

"What are you looking for?" Kaelen asked, his blades drawn, watching the sky.

"The root," Angelica muttered. "The Zenith lines are too clean. They're monitored. If I jack in there, Vane will bounce me in a microsecond. I need the dirty lines. I need the sewer."

Her fingers brushed against a thick, greasy cable at the back of the bundle. It was warm to the touch, vibrating with a low, thrumming bass note. It smelled of ozone and old blood.

"Found you," she whispered.

She grabbed the main trunk line. It was a legacy analog carrier, probably used for emergency broadcasts before the digital switchover. It was forgotten. Unmonitored.

"Ria," she said, not looking up. "What are you doing?"

Ria was looking at the sky. Above them, Vane's shuttle was repositioning. The heavy cannons on its wings were tracking.

"I'm being a wall," Ria said. She slammed her visor down, the metal locking into place with a definitive _click_. "What are _you_ doing? We have ninety seconds before Vane vaporizes us."

"I'm changing the variables," Angelica said.

She nodded to Aeon.

The bird struck.

He drove the data-needle into the fiber-optic bundle she was holding, piercing the rubber insulation and tapping directly into the copper core.

At the same moment, Angelica placed her hand on his head. She didn't just touch him; she gripped him, her fingers digging into his metal feathers.

_Connect._

The world didn't end. It screamed.

---

It didn't go black. It went white.

A blinding, searing white that obliterated thought.

Angelica gasped, her back arching violently. Her physical body seized, muscles locking up as the surge hit her nervous system. It felt like being electrocuted, but from the inside out. Her veins felt like they were filled with molten lead.

Her eyes rolled back into her head, showing only the whites. Foam flecked the corner of her lips.

To Ria and Kaelen, she looked like she was having a seizure. Her body vibrated against the stone, her heels drumming a frantic rhythm. Smoke began to curl from the connection point where Aeon's needle met the wire.

"Angie!" Ria took a step toward her. The panic in her voice was raw.

"Do not touch her!" Kaelen barked, grabbing Ria's arm.

Ria spun on him, her Titan servos whining. "Get off me! She's dying!"

"She is interfacing!" Kaelen shouted back, his usual calm cracking. "The bio-feedback loop is open! Her nervous system is acting as the ground for the entire Spire! If you touch her now, you will interrupt the circuit and liquefy her brain!"

Ria stared at him, breathing hard. She looked at the convulsing girl, then back at Kaelen.

"She's hurting," Ria whispered.

"She is surfing," Kaelen corrected, though his hands were shaking as he gripped his swords. "Logic dictates we protect the vessel while the mind is absent. If the link is broken physically, her consciousness will be trapped in the buffer. She will be a ghost in the machine forever."

A klaxon blared.

It wasn't the timer. It was deeper, louder. It came from the Spire itself. The obsidian floor vibrated.

Vane's voice boomed from the sky, stripped of its showman veneer.

"UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. DEPLOYING COUNTER-MEASURES. PURGE SEQUENCE INITIATED."

Panels slid open all around the perimeter of the platform.

"Here they come," Kaelen said, drawing his shadow-blades. The violet energy of his weapons flared, casting long shadows across the platform.

They crawled out of the dark.

They were metallic spiders, the size of large dogs. Their chassis were sleek, polished chrome, reflecting the harsh sunlight. Each one had eight legs tipped with carbide spikes designed to puncture hull plating. Their mandibles were rotary saws that spun with a terrifying, high-pitched whine. Their eyes—clusters of sensor nodes—glowed a hostile, burning red.

Fifty units swarmed onto the platform. They moved with insectoid jitters, fast and erratic.

"Antivirus," Kaelen murmured. "Physical manifestation. Vane keeps a digital kennel."

Ria slammed her fists together. "Spiders. Why did it have to be spiders?"

She activated her Titan shield. A wall of shimmering force sprang into existence around them.

"Come and get some, you scrap-heap rejects!" she roared. "You want the girl? You go through the Titan!"

---

Angelica was flying.

She had no body. She had no weight. She was a point of consciousness streaking through a tunnel of light.

The data-stream was a hurricane. Packets of information slammed into her, but they weren't wind or rain. They were concepts.

_News Cycle 47: The Emperor's health is stable..._
_Stock Report: Tibanna gas futures up 2%..._
_Personal Comm: Mom, I'm scared..._
_Surveillance Feed: Sector 7 Riot in progress..._

It was the collective noise of the Zenith Colony, a billion voices screaming into the void. It was overwhelming. The sheer volume of data threatened to tear her consciousness apart, to scatter her ego like dust in a storm.

She saw the code of the Spire not as text, but as geometry. It was a city.

Towers of logic rose around her, built from golden algorithms. They spiraled into the infinite digital sky, pulsing with the heartbeat of the network. Streets of data flowed like rivers of mercury, carrying the traffic of a civilization.

But it wasn't just a city. It was a fortress.

She saw the Patrol Programs—shark-like avatars of pure code patrolling the data-rivers, devouring corrupt packets. She saw the Firewalls—glimmering force fields that protected the secrets of the Highborn houses.

She banked, swooping through a canyon of encrypted archives. Aeon was with her—not as an owl, but as a golden comet, streaking ahead, burning a path through the static.

_Target: Primary Broadcast Node._

It was ahead. A massive, pulsing sun in the center of the digital city. It was the source. The voice of the Emperor. The eye of Vane. It sat atop a mountain of black data-glass, radiating authority.

She dived towards it.

"I'm coming for you," she thought-screamed.

Suddenly, the sky turned red.

A wall slammed down.

It didn't fall; it manifested. One moment, the path was clear. The next, a sheer cliff of frozen code blocked her path.

It was Red Ice.

Angelica had heard whispers of it in the Scavenger markets. Military-grade encryption. The kind that didn't just block you; it hunted you. It was cold—a cold that burned her mind. It smelled of sterility and death.

_ACCESS DENIED._

The words weren't heard; they were felt. A rejection stamp on her soul. A hammer blow to her forehead.

Angelica slammed into the wall. She didn't hit it physically; her connection spiked. She bounced off, her avatar flickering, her signal degrading.

"Open up!" she screamed.

She raised her hand. In the real world, she was holding a wire. In here, she was holding a star.

She threw a logic bomb—a packet of recursive code Kaelen had uploaded to Aeon. It hit the ice and sizzled, barely scratching the surface alongside a pathetic shower of digital sparks.

The wall grew thicker. It towered over her, miles high, infinite. It began to form spikes, growing outward like crystals.

_AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED. INPUT HIGHBORN BIO-SIGNATURE._

The voice of the system was calm, female, and utterly soulless.

"I don't have a bio-signature!" Angelica yelled. "I'm a ghost!"

_UNRECOGNIZED USER. DELETION IMMINENT._

The Red Ice began to move. It wasn't just a wall; it was a glacier. It was crushing forward, threatening to erase her. If it touched her, it wouldn't just kick her out. It would fry her neural pathways. She would wake up a vegetable.

"Kaelen!" she screamed into the void. "It's too thick!"

But Kaelen couldn't help her here. Here, she was alone.

---

"Ria! Left flank!"

Kaelen was a blur. He moved faster than the eye could track. He spun, his shadow-blade severing the leg of a spider mid-leap. The machine crashed to the ground, sparking, and Kaelen finished it with a stab through the central processor.

"I got it!" Ria shouted.

She caught a leaping spider in mid-air. Her gauntlet clamped around its chassis. The rotary saw grinded against her armor plating, throwing sparks into her face, but the Titan-Plate held.

She squeezed. The spider crumpled like a soda can. She threw the wreckage into the face of another unit climbing over the edge.

"They're endless!" she yelled, backhanding another one off the platform. "Where are they coming from?"

"Auto-factories in the lower spire," Kaelen replied, ducking under a razor-sharp leg. "They will keep coming until the threat is neutralized."

He looked back at Angelica. She was still sitting cross-legged, her body jerking occasionally. Foam was dripping from her chin.

"Runt!" he shouted, though he knew she couldn't hear him. "Whatever you are doing, do it faster!"

Three more spiders crested the edge. Kaelen engaged two, his blades weaving a defensive web of steel. The third one ignored him. It scurried low to the ground, aiming for the gap in Ria's guard.

"Ria! Check low!"

Ria couldn't move fast enough. Her armor was heavy, sluggish after the Overload. The spider lunged, its saw biting into her ankle joint.

_SCREECH._

"Get off!" Ria roared. She kicked the spider away, but the damage was done. Hydraulic fluid sprayed from her leg. She stumbled, her shield flickering.

The shield failed.

The wall of force vanished. The platform was open.

"Defensive perimeter broken!" Kaelen yelled. He shadow-stepped, appearing in front of Angelica just as a spider leaped for her throat.

He caught the spider on his blades. The weight of the machine drove him to one knee. The rotary saw spun inches from his face, the heat searing his skin.

"Not today," he grunted.

He pushed the spider back and severed its head.

But he was slowing down. He was bleeding from a cut on his shoulder. His breath was coming in ragged gasps. Every shadow-step drained his stamina, and he had used a dozen in the last minute.

"Ria!" he called out. "I cannot hold them!"

Ria limped back, standing over Angelica's prone body like a mother bear. She ripped a piece of obsidian railing from the platform edge—a six-foot slab of stone.

"Let them come!" she screamed, swinging the stone like a club.

She smashed a spider into scrap. Then another. She was a whirlwind of violence, buying time with sheer brutality.

But the swarm was adapting. They started circling, probing for weaknesses. They weren't just mindless drones; they were learning.

A spider leaped past Ria's guard. It landed on Angelica's back. Its rotary saw spun up, aiming for her neck.

"NO!" Kaelen screamed.

He threw his sword.

It was a desperate throw. The blade flew end-over-end. It hit the spider square in the sensor array. The impact knocked it off Angelica, pinning it to the floor.

Kaelen was unprotected.

Three spiders jumped him at once. One latched onto his leg, its spikes digging deep into his thigh. Another clawed at his back.

Kaelen cried out, falling to the ground under the weight of the machines.

But these weren't standard drones. The one on his back was larger. Its chassis was painted with red stripes.

_Alpha Class,_ Kaelen's HUD warned, flashing red. _Hunter-Killer protocols active._

The Alpha reared back, its rotary saw screaming. It aimed for Kaelen's spine.

"Not today!" Kaelen roared.

He rolled. It was a clumsy, desperate move, but it saved his life. The saw sparked against the stone floor, carving a groove inches from his neck.

Kaelen kicked the smaller spider off his leg, ignoring the pain of tearing flesh. He scrambled to his feet, breathing hard.

The Alpha hissed. It circled him, its eight legs moving in a hypnotic, terrifying rhythm. Its sensors locked onto him. It knew he was hurt. It knew he was tired.

"Come on," Kaelen taunted, raising his blades. "You want the Shadow? Take him."

The spider lunged.

It was fast—faster than anything Kaelen had fought in the arena. It feinted left, then struck right.

Kaelen parried. His shadow-blade met the carbide leg with a deafening _CLANG_. The force of the blow jarred his arm to the shoulder.

He followed up with a riposte, aiming for the sensor cluster. The spider dodged, skittering backward.

It was playing with him.

_Adaptability,_ Kaelen realized. _It's learning my patterns._

He had to change the equation.

He closed his eyes. He didn't look at the spider. He felt the vibration of its legs on the obsidian.

_Left. Right. Scuttle. Pounce._

He moved before the spider jumped.

He dropped his guard. A fatal mistake—or a perfect trap.

The Alpha took the bait. It leaped, its saw spinning for his chest.

Kaelen didn't dodge. He stepped _into_ the attack.

"Shadow Art: Void Strike!"

He thrust his blade forward, under the spinning saw, directly into the spider's exposed underbelly.

Metal crunched. Sparks showered his face.

The spider spasmed, its legs thrashing wildly. One spiked limb caught Kaelen in the ribs, cracking bone.

Kaelen grunted, but he didn't let go. He twisted the blade, severing the power core.

The machine died. It slumped onto him, heavy and lifeless.

Kaelen shoved it off, gasping for air. Blood was soaking his uniform. His ribs burned with every breath.

"Kaelen!" Ria turned, distracted by his scream.

In that split second, the line broke. Ten spiders surged toward Angelica.

---

In the digital dark, Angelica was losing.

The Red Ice was encroaching. It was freezing her thoughts. She could feel her memories slowing down, becoming sluggish. She was being overwritten.

_System demands Order,_ Aeon's voice whispered in her mind. _System demands Structure._

"I don't have structure," Angelica wept. "I'm just a scavenger. I'm just trash."

_Optimization: The System cannot process illogical data._

Angelica looked at the wall. It was perfect. Smooth. Flawless. It was the Zenith. It was Highborn perfection.

It couldn't handle dirt.

She realized what she had to do.

"You want authorization?" she whispered. "You want a signature? Fine. Here's my signature."

She didn't try to hack the wall. She didn't try to use logic.

She opened the floodgates.

She remembered the Silt.

She remembered the smell of the chemical rain burning her nostrils. She remembered the taste of rat meat. She remembered the cold nights huddling with Leo under a tarp. She remembered the fear. The hunger. The rage.

She took all the pain, all the chaos, all the messy, broken parts of her life that the Zenith tried to pretend didn't exist, and she gathered them into a ball of psychic sludge.

She threw it at the wall.

It hit the Red Ice.

The ice didn't crack. It _rotted_.

The perfection turned gray. The smooth code blistered and boiled. The system tried to analyze the data, but it couldn't. It was illogical. It was emotional. It was raw, unfiltered humanity.

_ERROR. DATA CORRUPTION. UNKNOWN VARIABLE. FEAR. PAIN. HOPE._

The system shrieked. It couldn't classify the input. It panicked.

The wall shattered.

It didn't break into pieces; it dissolved, melting away into a puddle of digital slush.

The path was open.

The Broadcast Node pulsed before her, naked and vulnerable.

Angelica flew into the sun.

---

On the platform, the world screamed.

A sound like a dying star erupted from the Spire. It was a frequency that shattered glass.

The spiders froze. Their circuits overloaded. They twitched once, spasms of sparks flying from their joints, and then collapsed, dead weight on the stone.

Kaelen, pinned under a pile of deactivated machines, shoved them off and gasped for air. He looked at Ria. She was on one knee, her shield flickering and dying, surrounded by a ring of crushed metal.

"Did we win?" she wheezed.

Above the clouds, in the pristine city of Zenith, the screens changed.

Every holographic billboard in the Commerce Sector flickered and died. Every personal datapad in the hands of the Highborn went static. Every massive screen in the arenas, the bars, the spaceports—they all went black.

The image of Headmaster Vane, his face purple with rage, vanished.

Currents of violet static tore through the feed.

And then, a new image resolved.

It wasn't just on the screens. It was everywhere.

In the Imperial Palace, deep within the Core Spire, the Emperor sat on his floating throne. The room was dark, lit only by the holographic feed that surrounded him 360 degrees.

He was watching the chaos.

He saw the riots starting in Sector 7. He saw the firebombs hitting the checkpoints in the Silt. He saw the panic in the eyes of his Highborn subjects in the Opera House.

He smiled.

It was a terrible, ancient smile.

"Beautiful," he whispered. His voice sounded like grinding stones.

A servant approached, trembling. "Your Majesty? The Council is requesting an emergency transmission. They want to know why the broadcast hasn't been cut."

The Emperor waved his hand, dismissing the request.

"Let it play," he said.

"But... Your Majesty... she is inciting rebellion. She is breaking the laws of the Zenith."

"She is conducting a stress test," the Emperor corrected. He leaned forward, his eyes fixed on the grainy image of the girl with the wire in her hand. "The colony has grown stagnant. Too much peace. Too much order. We are rotting from the inside."

He watched the riots spread. He watched the fear.

"Fear keeps the blood pumping," the Emperor said. "Chaos strengthens the strong and culls the weak. This girl... she is not breaking my city. She is waking it up."

He tapped a finger on the arm of his throne.

"Vane was right," the Emperor mused. "She is a variable. But perhaps... she is the variable we need."

He laughed, a low rumble that shook the heavy tapestries.

"Burn it all down, child," he whispered to the screen. "Let's see what rises from the ashes."

---

It was grainy. It was distorted. The lighting was bad.

It was a girl.

She was sitting on the ground, wires trailing from her hand. Her hair was a bird's nest. Her face was streaked with blood and grease. Her eyes were rolling white, burning with an unholy inner light.

She looked like a demon. She looked like a saint.

The audio crackled, overriding the volume limiters. It boomed from the sky speakers in every sector, shaking the windows of the palaces.

**"You are watching."**

Her voice was distorted, layered with a digital echo.

**"You can't look away, can you?"**

In the Highborn Quarter, the Gilded Cage Opera House was silent. The soprano on stage had stopped singing mid-aria. She was looking up at the massive, gilded screen that dominated the proscenium arch.

Lady Corinne sat in her private box, a velvet island suspended above the commoners. She held a crystal flute of vintage wine, grown in the hydroponic gardens of the Agricultural Ring.

Her hand trembled. The wine rippled.

"She's actually doing it," Corinne whispered.

Around her, the elite of Zenith society were frozen. Duke Verris dropped his monocle. Countess Iona gasped, clutching her pearls. They were statues, their perfectly sculpted faces cracking under the weight of the impossible.

Corinne didn't look at them. She looked at the girl on the screen. The girl she had underestimated. The girl she had called a "variable."

"She isn't a variable," Corinne realized, a cold thrill running down her spine. "She is the constant."

She stood up. The movement was sharp, sudden.

"Look at her!" she shouted at the stunned audience below. "Look at what you created!"

She threw her wine glass at the screen. It shattered against the projection field, a splash of red like blood on a ghost.

"Scream, little rat!" Corinne laughed, a sound that bordered on hysteria. "Scream until their ears bleed!"

**"You think this is a game,"** Angelica said. **"You place your bets. You cheer for the blood. You think we are pieces on a board."**

In the Iron Legion Barracks, Sector 4, the mess hall was deadly quiet. Three thousand soldiers stood at attention, their synth-mash forgotten on their trays.

Sergeant Voss stood on a table. He was a veteran of the Border Wars, a man with more scars than skin. He squinted at the screen, his one good eye tracking the movement in the background.

He saw the Titan. Ria. He recognized her stance—the way she planted her feet, the way she held her ground. He had taught her that stance.

He saw the Shadow. Kaelen. He saw the precision of his movements, even in exhaustion.

And he saw the Runt.

"Gods damn me," Voss whispered.

A young recruit next to him, a boy barely out of the Academy, looked up. "Sergeant? Are they... are they traitors?"

Voss looked at the boy. Then he looked back at the screen, at the three candidates standing against the world.

"Traitors?" Voss spat on the floor. "No, son. That's Squad Iron. And they just declared war on the whole damn system."

He unclipped his comm-bead from his ear and dropped it into his soup.

"I'm not listening to Vane's orders today," Voss announced to the silent room. "Today, we listen to _them_."

**"We are not your entertainment,"** Angelica screamed. The feedback whined. **"We are the Iron Selection. We survived your poison. We survived your traps. We survived each other."**

In the Silt, deep in the chemical fog of Level 12, the "Rusty Lung" tavern was usually a place of noise. But not today.

Gale, a sulfur miner with hands like rocks and a face like leather, wiped the condensation from the broken screen mounted above the bar.

He saw the flicker. He saw the girl.

He stopped breathing.

He knew that face. He had seen her three cycles ago, scavenging copper wire from a collapsed ventilation shaft. He had almost chased her off, but she had looked so hungry, so desperate, that he had given her a half-eaten nutrient bar instead.

"That's the Scavenger," he rasped. "That's the Ward girl."

The bar went dead silent. Everyone looked at Gale.

"She made it," someone whispered. "She actually made it to the top."

**"We are not leaving,"** the girl on the screen said. **"And you are not winning."**

Gale felt something deep in his chest—a feeling he hadn't felt in twenty years. It wasn't hunger. It wasn't pain.

It was pride.

He picked up his glass of rot-gut whiskey. It was cloudy, foul-smelling liquid that burned the throat.

"She's right," Gale said. His voice was loud, cutting through the silence. "We aren't winning."

He smashed the glass on the floor.

"But we aren't losing anymore either!"

He raised his fist. It was a calloused, dirty fist, covered in sulfur dust.

"For the Runt!" he roared.

"FOR THE RUNT!" the bar roared back.

One by one, fists went up. Then cheers. Then screams. The Silt was waking up.

**"We are not leaving,"** the girl said. **"And you are not winning."**

Angelica leaned into the camera/mind. She looked directly into the soul of the colony.

**"This Spire is not a trophy. It is an antenna. And I just changed the frequency."**

She smiled. It was the smile of the Silt. It was the smile of the hungry.

**"We are the silt. And we are rising."**

---

_00:00_

The timer hit zero.

The broadcast cut.

Angelica collapsed. The connection severed instantly, snapping back like a rubber band. She fell sideways, hitting the cold stone hard.

"Angie!" Ria was there in a second, scooping her up.

Angelica was limp. Her breathing was shallow. Blood trickled from her nose and ears.

"Is she...?" Ria couldn't finish the sentence.

Kaelen checked her pulse. "Weak. But steady. The feedback nearly did fry her."

He looked at the sky.

"The timer," he said. "It is zero."

They looked at the shuttle.

The doors didn't open. The ramp didn't descend.

Headmaster Vane's voice didn't return.

Instead, the sky ripped open.

It wasn't a portal. It was a breach in the cloud layer so violent it created a thunderclap that knocked them all flat.

A massive shape descended.

It blocked out the sun. It was dark, industrial, scarred with asteroid impacts. It wasn't a shuttle. It was a ship. Or part of one.

"What is that?" Ria whispered, shielding her eyes.

"Extraction Claw," Kaelen said, his voice trembling. "Heavy industrial. Used for moving hull plates on capital ships. It... it is the Excision Protocol."

It was the size of a building. Four massive, magnetic talons, each one larger than the shuttle, extended from the gloom. They were covered in rust and industrial grime, ancient tools of a civilization that built stars.

It slammed down onto the platform.

_BOOM._

The impact threw them into the air. The talons dug into the obsidian, cracking the spire deep into its foundation. The sound was deafening—the groan of geology being tortured.

"Grab on!" Kaelen yelled, hooking his arm through a groove in the metal claw.

Ria grabbed Angelica with one arm and the claw with the other. Her armor bit into the metal, sparking.

The claw didn't open. It wasn't here to pick up passengers.

It was here to pick up the platform.

With a groan of tearing metal that sounded like the end of the world, the claw retracted.

It pulled.

The structural integrity of the Spire failed. Steel girders snapped like twigs. Concrete ties pulverized into dust. The entire top section of the Spire—the obsidian platform, the antenna, the battleground—was ripped free from the tower.

Gravity lurched. They were rising. Fast.

The wind tore at them. The platform swung beneath the claw, a tiny raft in a hurricane. Below them, the decapitated trunk of the Spire receded, sparking and smoking. Debris rained down on the clouds below—tons of rock and metal plummeting toward the Silt.

Ria watched it go.

She watched the arena shrinking. The place where she had killed her first man. The place where she had learned to sleep with one eye open. The place that had almost broken her.

_It looks small,_ she thought. _From up here, the hell looks like a toy._

She felt a strange, hollow ache in her chest. It wasn't sadness. It was the loss of purpose. Down there, she knew who she was: The Wall. The Protector.

Up here? she was just cargo.

_Kaelen,_ she thought, looking at the Shadow.

Kaelen was kneeling by the edge, gripping a rusted strut. His eyes were closed, but his HUD was flickering.

_Analysis: Rib fracture (Left, 4th, 5th). Tibia micro-fissure. Blood loss: 12%._

He cataloged the pain. He organized it. It was data.

_Stimulant injection required,_ he noted. _Adrenaline levels crashing._

He opened his eyes. He looked at Ria. He saw the fear in her eyes—not fear of death, but fear of the unknown.

_She needs a mission,_ Kaelen realized. _Without a mission, the Titan crumbles._

"Secure the VIP," Kaelen said loud enough to be heard over the wind.

Ria blinked. "What?"

"Angelica," Kaelen pointed to the unconscious girl. "Secure her. That is your primary objective. Do not let her slide off."

Ria nodded. Her shoulders squared. The fear vanished, replaced by duty.

"On it," she grunted. She pulled Angelica closer, shielding her from the wind with her massive body.

They rose through the clouds. The white mist enveloped them, wet and cold. Then, they punched through the upper layer.

The sky turned black. The air grew thin.

They were in the mesosphere.

Angelica stirred. Her eyes fluttered open.

"Did..." she croaked. "Did it work?"

Kaelen looked down at the colony fading beneath them. He saw the fires starting in the Silt. He saw the confusion in the Zenith. He saw the world they had broken.

"It worked," he said. "We got their attention. All of it."

"So..." Ria asked, looking at the massive ship pulling them into the stratosphere. "We won?"

Kaelen looked at the darkness of space approaching. He saw the stars. Cold. Distant. Indifferent. The massive ship looming above them was just a shadow against the void.

He felt the drain in his blood. The Shadow Arts exacted a heavy toll. Every step through the void burned a micro-gram of his soul. He could feel the coldness in his marrow—the Shadow Sickness that claimed all Night heirs eventually.

_I am not infinite,_ he realized. _I am a battery. And I am running low._

He looked at Angelica.

_But she... she is the generator._

He tightened his grip on his friends.

"No," he said, his voice barely a whisper against the roaring wind.

"Now the real game begins."

And in the darkness of the mesosphere, Kaelen Night smiled. It was a terrifying expression.

"And I have the first move."
