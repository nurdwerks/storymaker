### Scene 1: Sector X Center

- **Key Event:** The overloaded singularity collapses and then explodes into a "white hole," releasing a massive energy wave that shatters the bio-dome's glass ceiling and exposes the sector to vacuum.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Instinctively coordinates the group's positioning to avoid the initial blast, showing her growing command over chaotic situations.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **AI:** "Hull integrity compromised. Atmospheric venting in progress. Seal bulkheads."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "The sky is breaking! Run for the airlock!"

- **Key Event:** The reversed gravity from the white hole flings debris and survivors toward the edges of the dome, turning the jungle into a lethal shrapnel storm.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Uses her massive Strength and heavy chassis to anchor herself and Kaelen, preventing them from being sucked into the debris.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I've got you! Hold on to the heavy metal!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "The stars... they're so close."
