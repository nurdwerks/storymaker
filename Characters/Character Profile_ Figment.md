# Character Profile: Figment

**Archetype:** The Digital Peer / The Imaginary Friend
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views the digital realm as the only true reality, and himself as its master).
**Virtue Mask:** WIT (He frames his digital bullying as "Humorous Content").

## I. Role in the Story

Figment is a fellow hacker who only appears on screens. He is Lisbet’s equal in the "Digital Underground" and her constant companion in the wires.

- **The Connection:** He and Lisbet share memes and code-snippets in real-time, laughing at jokes that Angelica cannot see or hear.
- **The Insult:** He often puts a "clown filter" over Angelica’s face on the monitors, literally turning her into a joke in the digital space where he and Lisbet dwell.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** System Overload / Psychological Breakdown. **Location:** Book 5, Chapter 8 (The Ghost Signal). During a massive hack into the Zenith's central server (Alien Code), Figment is hit by a "logic bomb" that permanently scrambles his cognitive processing. He loses the ability to distinguish between digital and physical reality.
  **Quote:** _"Does this logic bomb make my RAM look big?"_
- **Impact on Lisbet:** Lisbet is forced to "disconnect" him from the network to save the rest of the Underground. This acts as a catalyst for her own descent into paranoia, as she realizes that her most brilliant soldier can be erased by a single line of enemy code.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Edge" is gone. The Underground becomes more cautious and defensive, losing the reckless, creative flair that Figment provided, turning their "rebellion" into a state of digital survival.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 4 | Chapter 32 | Detailed Description | As Squad Iron stares at the stars, others emerge from the airlock behind them. **Lisbet (The Glitch)** climbs up, Figment's fading hologram on her shoulder. She finds a spot near Zephyr, her goggles reflecting the nebula's glow. **Hatcher (The Null)** steps onto the observation deck, shotgun slung over his shoulder. He says nothing, just lights a cigarette and watches the void. Even **Baron Gilded**—reduced now to a shivering wreck in borrowed clothes, his wealth meaningless—has followed them. He stares at the stars with hollow, traumatized eyes. Out there, in the infinite dark, his gold means nothing. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 32 | Dialog | **Lisbet:** "The stars are still there. Figment says they haven't moved. That's... that's something, right?" |
| Book 5 | Chapter 03 | Detailed Description | In the corner of the mess hall, **Lisbet (The Glitch)** reviews the ship's power grid on a cracked datapad. Her goggles flicker with scrolling code as Figment—still alive at this point—whispers calculations in her ear. She doesn't care about the political posturing; she cares about the hard numbers. When Angelica asks for a technical assessment, Lisbet gives it straight: they have enough power for life support OR weapons, not both. The General's "defensive posture" would require rerouting power from the cryo-bays, killing thousands of sleepers. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | **Figment**, Lisbet's bonded AI companion, manifests. Usually, he appears as a small, cartoonish dragon or a floating eye. Now, he creates a full-sized holographic avatar—a knight made of blue wireframe. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Figment:** "Logic virus detected. Class: Banshee. It's designed to enslave the navigation computer and vent the atmosphere. Nasty piece of work." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | He expands his code, creating a digital quarantine "sandbox" around the incoming data. He wraps his own programming around the virus, grappling with it like a wrestler. The virus fights back, eating away at Figment's integrity. His voice distorts, shifting between octaves. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Figment:** "I can't delete it. It's too adaptive. But I can eat it. I can trap it in my own kernel." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | Lisbet tries to get up. She realizes what he is saying. She loves Figment more than most humans. He raised her. Losing him is like losing a limb. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | Figment shakes his head. His avatar is already dissolving into static. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Figment (Static-filled):** "Too late. It's been real, Liz. Or... you know. Whatever reality is. Don't forget to defrag." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 08 | Moment | **Lisbet** — Devastated by the loss of Figment, she shows that her connection to machines is deeper than her connection to people. Her grief is raw and absolute. |
