---

### Scene 1: The Encounter

### Scene 2: The Map

- **Key Event:** Hatcher reveals he has a physical map of the "Foundation"—the lowest level of the ship where the primary lifesupport cores are located.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Impossible. That sector was sealed by an Imperial Edict in the 12th Century. No physical maps should exist."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Edicts don't matter when the walls are falling down, Doc. I found this in a captain’s locker. It shows the way to the 'The Brain'."

### Scene 3: The Mystery

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes Hatcher is actually carrying a high-ranking Zenith identification chip, implying he was more than a simple scavenger.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — Evades questions about his past, focusing only on the "debt" he owes the ship.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "That's a Gold-Tier ID. You were a Pilot? Or a Commander?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "I was a lot of things. Now I'm just a drifter with a map. You coming or not?"

### Scene 4: The Alliance

- **Key Event:** The group agrees to follow Hatcher to the Foundation, recognizing that their survival depends on his knowledge of the "deep vents."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Decides to trust a stranger over the data-driven pessimism of Dr. Aris.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He has the map. We have the muscle. It's a survival pact. Move out."
