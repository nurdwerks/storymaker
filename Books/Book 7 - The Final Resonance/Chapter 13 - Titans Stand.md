## Chapter 13: Titan's Stand

### Scene 1: Exterior Hull / Sector 5

- **Key Event:** Ria leads Squad Iron in a zero-G counter-assault. They use magnetic grapnels and physical pile-bunkers (explosive spikes).
- **Key Event:** Ria fully merges with Titan. Her skin turns gunmetal grey. She becomes a walking tank.

### Scene 2: The Melee

- **Key Event:** The Shards try to flatten Ria, but her density is too high. She catches a 2D shard and snaps it—it shatters like glass.
- **Key Event:** She realizes that blunt, primitive force works where magic failed.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She laughs, a harsh metallic sound. The simple act of smashing something restores her confidence.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "They break! If you hit 'em hard enough, they break!"

### Scene 3: The Support

- **Key Event:** Kaelen, recovered, provides sniper support from the airlock, targeting the shattered weak points Ria creates.
- **Key Event:** They have found a rhythm. The "Hammer and Anvil" tactic.
