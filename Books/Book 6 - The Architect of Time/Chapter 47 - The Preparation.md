## Chapter 47: The Preparation

### Scene 1: The War Room / The Aeterna Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica convenes the final strategic council before the assault on the Alien Armada.
- **Detailed Description:** The briefing room of the _Aeterna_ is a stark contrast to the makeshift war rooms of the past. It is clean, lit by the cool blue of the tactical hololith. The table displays a 3D rendering of the enemy fleet—a swirling, organic mass of green bio-ships. Around the table stand the veterans of twenty years of war: General Ria, scarred and cybernetic; Zephyr, grey-haired but still wearing his rogue's grin; Kaelen, the silent shadow; **Lady Corinne**, the Ancient Matriarch; and the hologram of Dr. Aris (or his AI proxy). Angelica stands at the head. She is no longer the young girl from the Silt. She is an Admiral, wearing a uniform that is practical and severe. She outlines the enemy's weakness: they are a hive mind. They react instantly to threats, but they lack individual creativity. They predict logical patterns.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica knows that to win, she has to be irrational. She has to do something so insane that a computer mind cannot predict it. She feels the weight of every life on her ship. She knows that 90% of them will not survive the next hour. She pushes the guilt down, locking it away in the same place she keeps her grief for Torin.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She reveals the depth of her strategic evolution. She is not just reacting; she is dictating the flow of the battle. She commands with absolute authority.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They are a machine. Machines are predictable. We are chaos. That is our advantage."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Chaos usually gets you killed, Commander."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "Or it gets you noticed. The etiquette of war requires us to be rude, my dear. We must break their rules."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Order gets you enslaved. I prefer the risk."

### Scene 2: The Plans / The Deflection Strategy

- **Key Event:** Angelica reveals the "Deflection Strategy."
- **Detailed Description:** She manipulates the hologram. She shows the _Aeterna_ acting not as a flagship, but as a distraction. She plans to drive the _Aeterna_ deep into the enemy formation, drawing their fire and their sensors. While the hive mind focuses on the "Big Gun," Zephyr's stealth squadron will slip through the blind spot created by the _Aeterna_'s sensor-jamming wake. They will deliver the payload—the Vane-Shard—directly to the Mothership.
- **Detailed Description:** The plan is met with silence. It uses the _Aeterna_—their home, their only sanctuary—as a shield. It puts Angelica directly in the line of fire. It relies on split-second timing and the suicidal bravery of the fighter pilots.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr looks at the plan. He sees what she is doing. She is making herself the target so he can be the hero. He hates it. He wants to argue, but he sees the logic. It is the only way to bypass the shield grid.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She proves she is willing to sacrifice herself. She is not sending them to die; she is leading the charge.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'll hold the door open. You just have to walk through it. Don't miss, Zephyr."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I never miss when the target is that big. But you... you're going to take a lot of heat."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I can take it. The ship can take it. We built her for this."

### Scene 3: The Command / The Hangar Bay

- **Key Event:** Angelica addresses the crew.
- **Detailed Description:** She walks through the ship, from the bridge to the hangar bay. She speaks to the engineers, the gunners, the pilots. She touches the hull of the ship, grounding herself. She sees the fear in the younger crew members—children born in the void who have never seen a planet. She doesn't lie to them. She tells them that today is the day they earn their future.
- **Internal Conflict:** She sees faces that remind her of the friends she lost. A mechanic who looks like Timmy. A gunner who has Hatcher's eyes. She realizes that the crew is her family now. She is fighting for them, not just for the abstract concept of "Humanity."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We have run for twenty years. We have hidden in asteroids, in nebulas, in the dark. Today, we stop running. Today, we turn around and we bite back."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Crewman:** "For the Zenith! For the Captain!"

### Scene 4: The Experience / The Final Check

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Zephyr share a final moment before launch.
- **Detailed Description:** In the hangar, Zephyr is climbing into his fighter. Angelica stops him. They don't hug; they aren't that kind of people anymore. They share a look of profound understanding. They are the last of the original Silt-rats. They remember the sewers, the heist, the fall. They are the survivors.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica hands him a small token—perhaps the coin he gave her in Book 1, or a piece of the original Zenith. A lucky charm.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica realizes how much she relies on him. He is her anchor to her humanity. If he dies, she will be truly alone.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I had 5,000 years to think of this plan. It better be good."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "You overthink everything. Just point me at the bad guys."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Come back, Zephyr. That's an order."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Aye aye, Captain."
