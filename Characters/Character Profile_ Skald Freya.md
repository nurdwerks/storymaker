# Character Profile: Skald Freya

**Archetype:** The Voice of Glory / The Storyteller
**True Sin:** PRIDE (She believes she has the power to decide whose life is "glorious" enough to be remembered).
**Virtue Mask:** ARTISTRY (She claims her bias is just "Divine Inspiration" or "The Will of the Spirits").

## I. Role in the Story

Skald Freya is the storyteller who sings the songs of Ragnar’s deeds. She is the keeper of the Warband's cultural identity and their sense of immortality.

- **The Erasure:** She refuses to sing about Angelica, actively erasing the protagonist's contributions to their survival from the tribe's memory.
- **The Scorn:** "There is no glory in a machine-witch," she says, dismissing magic as a "Zenith soft-skin" trick that has no place in a warrior's song.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Loss of Voice / Maiming. Freya is captured by a Zenith interrogator who, recognizing her role as the "voice" of the rebellion, surgically removes her tongue and vocal cords. She is left alive but unable to sing or speak.
- **Impact on Ragnar:** The Warband loses its spirit. Ragnar realizes that without Freya to sing of their deeds, they are just "savages" who will be forgotten by history. He becomes increasingly desperate to leave a mark on the world.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Songs" stop. The atmosphere of the camp becomes grim and silent, as the warriors realize that their mortality is now absolute; there is no one left to sing them into legend.

**Event Location:** Book 6, Chapter 15
**Defining Quote:** _"A singer without a voice is a bird with no wings. She is useless to me now."_ — Ragnar
