## Chapter 9: The Anomaly

### Scene 1: The Test

- **Key Event:** In the Observation Deck, the Headmaster and Prelate Vane discuss Angelica's bonding with the Clockwork Gryphon—thought extinct after the Artificer Guild purge.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "She isn't a Null anymore. She entered the system. She found a backdoor. She bypassed the biological resonance requirement and substituted a mechanical one."

- **Key Event:** Vane notes the creature requires a fuel source that no longer exists (Chronometric Cores were destroyed) and suggests letting it starve to see what happens.

### Scene 2: The Feeding

- **Key Event:** In the mess hall, Aeon refuses all food. Angelica steals a real apple from Squad Gold's table and offers it to him.

- **Key Event:** Aeon's beak touches the apple and it ages instantly—brown spots spread, skin wrinkles, flesh collapses, then turns to dust in five seconds.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Aeon** — Revealed as an Entropy Feeder that consumes timelines, not matter. He ate the apple's remaining duration.

- **Key Event:** Other cadets freeze in shock. Angelica lies to Halloway that it's "fast metabolism" and "digestion" to hide Aeon's true nature, knowing the Zenith would dissect him if they knew.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Ward... what the hell is that thing?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Digestion. Fast metabolism. Inefficient waste processing. He runs hot."

### Scene 3: The Analysis

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes Aeon is a living paradox—he steals time to power his gears. He accelerates entropy to infinity.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Lies to protect Aeon, knowing the truth would get him killed and weaponized.

### Scene 4: The Voice

- **Key Event:** That night, Angelica hears a voice in her head—Aeon communicating telepathically. He calls himself "The Archivist" who keeps seconds and eats wasted moments.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "I am the Archivist. I keep the seconds. I eat the moments you waste."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "She is dreaming of violence. Tasty. The adrenaline speeds up her local time. I could eat the edges of it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. No eating people. No eating dreams."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon:** "Limiters set. Awaiting input."

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes she is holding a time bomb—the most expensive pet in the universe that eats the one thing no one can buy more of: time.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He eats seconds, minutes, hours. He is the most expensive pet in the universe. He eats the one thing no one can buy more of."
