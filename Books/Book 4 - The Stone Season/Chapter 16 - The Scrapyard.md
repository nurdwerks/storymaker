## Chapter 16: The Scrapyard

### Scene 1: The Sanctuary / Area 51

- **Key Event:** They limp into the shadows of the industrial sector.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher stops at a pile of rusted junk. A washing machine, a car chassis, tangled wire.
- **Key Event:** He kicks the chassis three times. _Clang. Clang. Clang._
- **Key Event:** A hidden scanner reads the vibration pattern.
- **Key Event:** The pile of junk groans and slides aside. Reveals a blast door.
- **Key Event:** "Home sweet dump," Hatcher mutters.
- **Key Event:** They enter. Inside, it isn't junk. It's a fortress.
- **Key Event:** Racks of servers. Hydroponic gardens under UV lights. A small fusion generator humming in the corner.
- **Key Event:** "The Lifeboat," Hatcher says, seeing Angelica's face. "The Spire is falling. The Foundation is rotting. This is the only place left where the air doesn't taste like ozone and lies."
- **Key Event:** It is a community. Scavengers, outcasts, people who rejected the Emperor and Vane.
- **Key Event:** They look up as Hatcher enters. They don't bow. They nod. Respect among equals.

### Scene 2: The Repairs / The Workshop

- **Key Event:** Ria is in bad shape. Her armor is shredded.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet, the mechanic, looks at the damage. "I don't have plasteel," she says. "This is high-grade military composite."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr steps up. His remaining mechanical hand whirs.
- **Key Event:** "We don't need pretty," he says. "We need tough."
- **Key Event:** He grabs a sheet of industrial plating—a blast shield from a mining drill.
- **Key Event:** "Hold this," he tells Lisbet.
- **Key Event:** They work together. Cutting, welding, riveting.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr calibrates the servos. His movements are precise, elegant. The ghost of the High-Deck engineer he used to be.
- **Key Event:** When they are done, Ria looks bulky. Dangerous.
- **Key Event:** "It's not gold plating, Ria," Zephyr says, knocking on the chest piece. "It's heavy-duty industrial shielding. You'll look like a tank, but you'll move like a freight train."
- **Key Event:** In the corner, Tinker is working on a heater. A steam pipe is leaking.
- **Key Event:** "Pressure is rising!" someone shouts.
- **Key Event:** Tinker grabs the pipe. He tries to seal it with a wrench.
- **Key Event:** _BOOM._ The seal blows.
- **Key Event:** Tinker is thrown back. His arm—his good arm—is gone. Shredded by the steam.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher runs to him. "Tinker!"
- **Key Event:** Tinker looks at the gauge. "I fixed it, Hatcher," he gasps, going into shock. "The pressure is... stable."
- **Key Event:** He passes out. Hatcher stares at the blood. The cost of warmth.

### Scene 3: The Intel / The War Room

- **Key Event:** They gather around a holographic map table. It flickers.
- **Key Event:** "The Nulls," Angelica asks. "What are they? They don't feel pain. They don't talk."
- **Key Event:** Hatcher pulls up a schematic. A human skull.
- **Key Event:** But the frontal lobe is gone. Replaced by a block of silicon.
- **Key Event:** "They aren't robots," Dr. Aris says, his voice shaking. "They are lobotomies. Vane removed the organic risk—the fear, the doubt. He replaced biology with copper."
- **Key Event:** "It's not evolution," Aris adds. "It's masonry. He's building a wall out of people."
- **Key Event:** Suddenly, Old Man Rust gasps.
- **Key Event:** He clutches his chest. His eyes go wide.
- **Key Event:** "The Signal!" he shrieks. "I hear it! The Blue Sky!"
- **Key Event:** He falls to the floor. A memory-surge. A blast of data from the old world.
- **Key Event:** "The sky... it was blue!" he whispers, tears streaming down his dirty face. "I remember the birds! I remember!"
- **Key Event:** Then he stops breathing. His heart couldn't take the joy.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher closes his eyes. "Another one for the heap."

### Scene 4: The Preparation / The Airlock

- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the map. At the red zone deep below. "The Foundation."
- **Key Event:** "That's where the Pathogen started," she realizes. "Vane didn't cure it. He harvested it."
- **Key Event:** She looks at her team. Battered. Broken.
- **Key Event:** "We have to go down there," she says. "To the source."
- **Key Event:** She opens the supply crate.
- **Key Event:** She hands out the last of the clean water packets. The last ration bars.
- **Key Event:** It is a last meal.
- **Key Event:** "Check your seals," she orders. "Check your mags. This is the last stop. From here on, there are no maps."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night racks the slide on his rifle.
- **Key Event:** "Then we make our own path, Captain," he says.
- **Key Event:** They step into the airlock. The heavy door seals behind them.
- **Key Event:** Going down.
