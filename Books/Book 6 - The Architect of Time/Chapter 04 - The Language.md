## Chapter 4: The Language

### Scene 1: The Listening / The Cage

- **Key Event:** Angelica has been in the bamboo cage for three days.
- **Key Event:** She is dehydrated, sunburnt, and bored.
- **Key Event:** Her guard is a young spear-man who stares at her like she is a zoo animal.
- **Key Event:** Angelica decides to stop screaming and start listening.
- **Key Event:** She closes her eyes. She focuses on the sounds of the village.
- **Key Event:** The women weaving nets. The men sharpening spears. The children playing.
- **Key Event:** She tracks the phonemes. The rhythm.
- **Key Event:** It sounds like gibberish. Grunts and clicks.
- **Key Event:** But then she hears something. A pattern.
- **Key Event:** A mother scolding a child: "Na go da Zoon! Radz deir!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica replays it in her mind. _Na go da Zoon. Radz deir._
- **Key Event:** "No go... the Zone... Rads there."
- **Key Event:** Her eyes snap open.

### Scene 2: The Pattern / The Cage

- **Key Event:** She listens harder.
- **Key Event:** A hunter returns with a kill. "Big Flux! Gud Eet!"
- **Key Event:** _Big Flux. Good Eat._
- **Key Event:** Another man points to the sky. "Ops watching."
- **Key Event:** Angelica starts to laugh. She can't help it.
- **Key Event:** It's English. Broken, chewed up, swallowed, and spit out over five thousand years of devolution. But it's English.
- **Key Event:** Specifically, it's _Navy_ English.
- **Key Event:** "Flux" for change or movement. "Rads" for danger. "Ops" for gods (Operations). "Comms" for prayer.
- **Key Event:** "They aren't aliens," she whispers. "They're crew."

### Scene 3: The Theory / The Cage

- **Key Event:** The pieces fall into place.
- **Key Event:** The _Vanguard_. The lost colony ship from the 23rd Century.
- **Key Event:** It vanished in a wormhole.
- **Key Event:** "They crashed here," she theorizes. "Thousands of years ago. The survivors... they lost the tech, but kept the words. The words became holy. The manual became scripture."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the guard. He isn't a savage. He is the descendant of a flight engineer or a marine.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the stars.
- **Key Event:** For a second, a cold fear grips her. _Are they from the future? Is this Earth?_
- **Key Event:** She checks the moon. It's the wrong size. The gravity is slightly off.
- **Key Event:** No. This is another planet. Another time.
- **Key Event:** But the lineage is human.

### Scene 4: The Conclusion / The Cage

- **Key Event:** Angelica stands up. She holds onto the bars.
- **Key Event:** She waits for the guard to look at her.
- **Key Event:** She points to the water skin on his belt.
- **Key Event:** He grunts. "Na."
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes a deep breath. She shapes her mouth carefully.
- **Key Event:** "Giv... Wota," she says. Rough. Guttural. Imitating their accent.
- **Key Event:** The guard freezes. He drops his spear.
- **Key Event:** He looks at her with wide eyes. "U spek?"
- **Key Event:** "I spek," Angelica says, nodding. "Giv Wota. Ops command."
- **Key Event:** The guard trembles. He fumbles with the skin and passes it through the bars.
- **Key Event:** Angelica drinks. It is warm and muddy, but it tastes like victory.
- **Key Event:** She wipes her mouth.
- **Key Event:** She smiles at the guard. It is a sharp, dangerous smile.
- **Key Event:** "Language is just code with bad syntax," she whispers to herself. "I can crack this. I just need more data."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the village.
- **Key Event:** "And if I can talk to them, I can manipulate them. And if I can manipulate them, I can get out of this cage and find a way home."
- **Key Event:** "Teacher," the guard whispers, bowing his head.
- **Key Event:** "Class is in session," Angelica says.
