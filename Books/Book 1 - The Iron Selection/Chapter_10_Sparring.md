## Chapter 10: Sparring

### Scene 1: The Mat

- **Key Event:** In the Dojo, Angelica is paired against Toro—a Foundry District cadet with forty pounds of muscle and superior reach.

- **Key Event:** Angelica is fast but cannot hit back effectively. Toro catches her jab, sweeps her legs, and pins her with a knee to the chest.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Toro:** "Stay down, Silt-Rat. You don't belong here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Instructor:** "Point, Toro. Reset! Get up, Ward. Pain is data. Assimilate it and improve."

### Scene 2: The Break

- **Key Event:** Ria fights Toro next. She takes his haymaker directly to the jaw without flinching—her skin rings like metal (Steel-Hide bond progressing).

- **Key Event:** Ria grabs Toro's forearm and snaps his radius cleanly in two with raw hydraulic strength.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "My turn."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Weak bones. Drink more milk."

- **Key Event:** Later, Ria explains the "Numbness Sacrifice"—giving up the ability to feel soft things (like a lover's touch) in exchange for not feeling hard things.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I gave up feeling soft things so I wouldn't feel the hard things. That's the Numbness Sacrifice."

### Scene 3: The Corner

- **Key Event:** In the locker room, Toro's friends (three Foundry boys) corner Angelica, threatening to "teach her a lesson."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Foundry Boy:** "You think your bodyguard makes you safe? She's not here now."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Foundry Boy:** "We're going to teach you a lesson, Silt-Rat. Resonants don't take orders from mechanics."

- **Key Event:** Angelica feels panic, then white-hot indignation. Her Pride burns through fear.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Internal shift from fear to fury: "How dare they touch me?"

### Scene 4: The Push

- **Key Event:** When the leader reaches for her throat, Angelica reacts with pure kinetic rejection—a visible distortion wave throws all three boys twenty feet into the lockers.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Manifests raw Resonance (Kinetic Displacement, Level 5) for the first time, without a spell or focus.

- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane watches the feed from the Observation Deck, satisfied.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "There it is. Kinetic Displacement. Level 5. Raw, unrefined, and beautiful."

- **Key Event:** Angelica steps over the groaning boys but realizes she has put a target on her back. In the Zenith, dangerous things are either controlled or destroyed.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Physics is just a suggestion when you have enough energy."
