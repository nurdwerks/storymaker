## Chapter 13: Vane's Trap

### Scene 1: The Lights

- **Key Event:** The location is the "Hall of Ancestors" in the Museum of Pre-History, a vast gallery filled with holographic dioramas of the ship's original crew. The room is currently lit only by the faint blue glow of the security terminals.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher is at the main console, attempting to loop the camera feed. Lisbet is physically connected to the door lock, her fingers sparking as she talks to the mechanism.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr is keeping watch near the entrance, spinning a stolen ident-card between his fingers. He is nervous, his usual banter replaced by a tight-jawed silence.
- **Key Event:** The trap springs instantly. The museum's lighting array slams to 100% brightness—a blinding, sterile white "Interrogation Mode."
- **Key Event:** The security shutters drop over the exits. These are not standard blast doors; they are "containment fields" of hard-light, sizzling with kinetic dampeners.
- **Key Event:** A "Custodian" droid—a massive, ceramic-plated maintenance unit usually used for moving statues—activates from its alcove. It moves with terrifying speed for its size.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr yells a warning, but the Custodian backhands him. The blow sends him flying twenty feet. He crashes into a display case housing a "Pre-War Medical uniform." The glass shatters, burying him in shards.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He tries to stand, gasping for air. His "Gilded" persona cracks. He isn't a hero; he's a thief in a silk suit. He looks at Angelica with genuine terror.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Ribs... think they're dust. Get out, Angie! It’s a setup!"
- **Key Event:** Lisbet screams as her interface ports overload. The system pushes a "Feedback Spike" into her nervous system. She collapses, seizing.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She freezes. Her plan—relies on stealth and speed—is gone. She is paralyzed not by fear, but by the sudden realization of total tactical failure.

### Scene 2: The Reveal

- **Key Event:** The Custodian droid does not attack Angelica. It stands guard over Zephyr and Lisbet, holding them hostage.
- **Key Event:** The main doors slide open smoothly. They don't slam; they glide.
- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane enters. He is wearing his pristine white surgical robes. He is pulling on a fresh pair of latex gloves, the _snap_ echoing in the silent hall.
- **Key Event:** He steps over the broken glass. He doesn't look at Zephyr. He looks only at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** Vane stops ten feet away. He activates his ocular implants, the lenses whirring as they zoom in on her pupil dilation and heart rate.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Pulse one-twenty. Cortisol spiking. You look surprised, Subject Zero. Did you really think you could break into my house without tripping the silent alarm?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica draws her weapon—a kinetic pistol. Vane doesn't flinch. He knows she won't shoot while he has her friends.
- **Key Event:** Vane begins to monologue, but it isn't gloating; it's a lecture. He explains _why_ he let them get this far. He needed to test her "Initiative Parameters."
- **Key Event:** He brings up her mother, Elena Valerius. He admits the truth casually, as if discussing the weather.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He reveals his cold-blooded history. He views murder as "data editing."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You have her eyes. It's unsettling. The last time I saw eyes like that, they were begging me for air. Yes, I killed her. I watched the life fade. She was standing in the way of the future."
- **Key Event:** Angelica's hand shakes. The rage is blinding.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You killed her because she knew what you were. A butcher."

### Scene 3: The Sacrifice

- **Key Event:** Vane sighs. He finds her morality "boring."
- **Key Event:** He decides to demonstrate the difference between "Flesh" and "Evolution."
- **Key Event:** A cloud of black dust begins to leak from the collar of his robe. It is the "Legion"—his nano-swarm. The sound is a high-pitched dental drill whine.
- **Key Event:** The swarm forms a floating sphere in his hand.
- **Key Event:** Vane takes a scalpel from his pocket. He slices off his own left earlobe. There is no grimace. No hesitation.
- **Key Event:** He tosses the piece of flesh into the swarm. The black cloud devours it instantly, turning the meat into more machines.
- **Key Event:** The wound on his head cauterizes itself with a hiss of steam as the nanites repair the breach.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — This self-mutilation reveals his terrifying commitment. He is not attached to his body. It is just fuel.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You cling to your meat, Angelica. You think pain matters. Pain is just a notification. I have deleted the user preference for suffering."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr vomits on the floor, horrified by the casual cannibalism.

### Scene 4: The Goal

- **Key Event:** Vane snaps his fingers. The Custodian droid grabs Angelica, pinning her arms. It is too strong to fight.
- **Key Event:** Vane approaches. He holds a collection device—a silver syringe with a wide bore.
- **Key Event:** He explains the "Cylinder of Truth" standing in the center of the room. It isn't just a statue; it's a biometric lock. A "Gene-Key."
- **Key Event:** It requires the blood of the Captain's lineage.
- **Key Event:** Vane jams the needle into Angelica's arm. He doesn't look for a vein; he just stabs. He draws a full vial of bright red blood.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She looks into his eyes—his multi-spectral, pupil-less eyes. She sees no soul. She sees a calculator.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You are not a person, my dear. You are a password made of meat. Once I have the code, I can format the drive."
- **Key Event:** Vane turns to the Cylinder. He inserts the vial.
- **Key Event:** The machine hums. The "Gene-Key" is accepted. The ancient locks begin to turn.
- **Key Event:** Vane smiles—a stretched, skin-tight expression that looks painful.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Finally. access granted."
