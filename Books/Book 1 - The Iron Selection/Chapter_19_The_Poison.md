- **Key Event:** A faint sound: "Thwip." Something bites Kaelen's neck. He pulls out a dart of black glass filled with iridescent liquid—Prima-Materia, unrefined magical waste that attacks the soul.

### Scene 4: The Discovery

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Ria find Kaelen's boot sticking out of gear housing. Ria suggests leaving him—he's House Night, he'd leave them.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He's House Night, Angel. He'd leave us in a heartbeat. He literally told us he would."

- **Key Event:** Angelica refuses, viewing him as "part of the engine" they don't throw away until broken beyond repair.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He's part of the engine. We don't throw away parts until they are broken beyond repair."

- **Key Event:** Angelica checks his pulse and recognizes the damage is magical, not fixable with bandages. She orders Ria to grab his legs—they're carrying him.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Even gods bleed. And when they do, the sharks come. We aren't sharks, Ria. We're wolves."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Wolves eat things too, Angel."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Yeah. But wolves hunt in a pack."
