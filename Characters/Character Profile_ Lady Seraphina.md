# Character Profile: Lady Seraphina

**Archetype:** The Social Rival / The Intended
**True Sin:** ENVY (She wants the destiny she believes was stolen by Angelica, and she wants Kaelen as a trophy of her status).
**Virtue Mask:** CHARITY (She poses as a helpful, "older sister" figure to hide her predatory intentions).

## I. Role in the Story

Lady Seraphina is a cousin of the Night family who represents the "perfect" life Kaelen was meant to lead. She is poised, dark-haired, and effortlessly "correct" in the eyes of the Matriarchy.

- **The Contrast:** She reminisces about balls and hunts that underscore Angelica's lack of history with Kaelen, making him feel like he belongs to another world.
- **The Cut:** She treats Angelica with sickly-sweet condescension, asking if she "needs help with the silverware," which reinforces the idea that Angelica is an uncultured savage unfit for the Night family.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Betrayal for Status. When Kaelen chooses to defend Angelica over a direct order from the Matriarchy, Seraphina realizes he will never be her "proper" husband. She betrays their escape route to Matriarch Lilith in exchange for a higher social standing within the court.
- **Impact on Kaelen Night:** Kaelen is disgusted by her lack of honor. He officially severs all ties with her, but her betrayal leads to a catastrophic ambush that nearly kills him, forcing him to realize how fragile his position truly is.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Intended" is revealed as a predator. The other socialites in the court begin to treat Seraphina with a mix of fear and admiration for her ruthlessness, further souring the social atmosphere for Angelica.

**Event Location:** Book 3, Chapter 23
**Defining Quote:** *"Why? So you can play hero again? So you can run away with *her*?"*
