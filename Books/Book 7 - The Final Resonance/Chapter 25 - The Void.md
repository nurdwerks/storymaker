## Chapter 25: The Void

### Scene 1: The Aftermath

- **Key Event:** The Zealots surrender. Ria takes them into custody, but nobody has the energy for anger. They are all just terrified survivors.
- **Key Event:** The Civil War is over, but the Hull defense is gone. The external sensors show the Sphere Fleet moving into attack formation.

### Scene 2: The Grim Calculation

- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the tactical map. They have no shields, no main leader (Vane is dead), and 30 minutes before the fleet makes contact.
- **Key Event:** She turns to Zephyr.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "We need a hammer. A big one."

### Scene 3: The Mining Deck

- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks at the "Colossus" Mining Rig—a massive, industrial mech designed to crack asteroids. It has a high-yield fusion drill.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He pats the hull of the mech. He knows it's a suicide run. He doesn't ask for payment.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "She's ugly, she leaks, and she smells like sulfur. She's perfect."
