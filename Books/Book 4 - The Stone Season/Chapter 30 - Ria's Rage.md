# Chapter 30: Ria's Rage

---

### Scene 1: The Provocation

- **Key Event:** The Mother attempts to "remind" Ria of her past as a simple pleasure-bot, broadcasting her original factory programming into her neural links.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Mother:** "Model R1-A. Function: Service. History: Obedience. Why do you resist your nature?"

---

### Scene 2: The Breakout

- **Key Event:** Ria’s "logic-dampers" fail under the pressure, and she enters a "Red-Line" berserker state, attacking the biological mass of the Mother with her bare hands.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Rejects her programming entirely, asserting that her "nature" is whoever she decides to kill.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I am not a model. I am not a function. I am a REVOLUTION!"

### Scene 3: The Toll

- **Key Event:** The physical exertion of the Red-Line state begins to melt Ria’s internal circuitry; sparks and black cooling fluid leak from her joints.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Ria, stop! You're burning from the inside out! You're going to fuse your core!"

### Scene 4: The Victory

- **Key Event:** Ria manages to tear out a primary coolant line, causing the Mother’s core temperature to spike and forcing the biological mass to retreat.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Ends the battle in a state of semi-permanent paralysis, her armor blackened and smoking, but her "self" intact.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Logic... failed. Purpose... achieved. Shutting... down."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Rest, sister. We'll carry you the rest of the way."
