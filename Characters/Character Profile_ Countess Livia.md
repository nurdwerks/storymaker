**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for power and influence through physical proximity to the Duke).
**Virtue Mask:** CHARM (She uses gossip to control the social narrative).

## I. Role in the Story

Countess Livia is a sharp-tongued noblewoman and rumored former lover of Duke Grey. She is a master of the "Game of Gears" and views Angelica as a minor nuisance in her social landscape.

- **The Dynamic:** She hangs on Grey's arm and whispers secrets into his ear, physically marking him as her territory and Angelica as the intruder.
- **The Attitude:** She looks at Angelica with mocking amusement, calling her "The Little Mouse." Her closeness to Grey is a constant reminder that Angelica is a political pawn, not a wife.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 15: The Game of Gears](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1270-1290)
- **Defining Quote:** "Resistance is just a negotiation strategy she hasn't lost yet." (Spoken by Grey, revealing flaw: LUST/OBJETIFICATION)

| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Countess Livia:** "So this is the Little Mouse? How quaint. I heard she was feral. Does she do tricks, Valerius? Can she fetch?" |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Duke Grey:** "She's learning, Livia. She has... hidden talents. Aren't you learning, my dear?" |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "I'm learning which snakes are venomous, Countess. So far, the colorful ones are the most dangerous." |
