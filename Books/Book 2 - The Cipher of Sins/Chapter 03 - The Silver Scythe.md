### Scene 1: The Pursuit (Imperial Library)

- **Key Event:** Angelica initiates her escape from the Imperial Library as Warden squads breach the main doors.
- **Detailed Description:** The library, a cavernous hall of data-crystals and holographic archives, erupts into chaos. Plasma bolts sear the air, vaporizing shelves of ancient texts. The smell of ozone and burning paper fills the room. Angelica, still clutching the data-chip from Solon, slides under a marble reading table as a volley of fire destroys the bust of a Founder above her head. She activates Aeon, who is perched on her shoulder in his dormant metallic form.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica battles the panic of being hunted. She is alone, framed for murder, and outgunned. But beneath the fear lies a cold, calculating anger. She refuses to die for a crime she didn't commit. Her mind races, calculating angles of fire and escape routes with the speed of a combat computer.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She demonstrates tactical superiority by using the environment against her attackers, toppling a massive data-stack to create a barrier.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Warden Captain:** "Target heading for the east wing! Cut her off! lethal force authorized!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Not today."

- **Key Event:** Angelica uses Aeon's "Flash Mode" to blind the pursuit team.
- **Detailed Description:** As the Wardens close in, Angelica whispers a command to the clockwork gryphon. Aeon's eyes flare with magnesium-white intensity. A strobe of blinding light pulses through the library, overloading the Wardens' tactical visors. While they stumble and curse, rubbing their eyes, Angelica sprints toward the emergency exit at the end of the hall.
- **Internal Conflict:** She feels a pang of regret for using Aeon so early. Every use of his power drains her own vitality, but survival demands the cost.

### Scene 2: The Dead End (The panoramic Window)

- **Key Event:** Angelica reaches the end of the corridor, only to find the elevator locked down.
- **Detailed Description:** The corridor ends in a massive, floor-to-ceiling panoramic window overlooking the Zenith city-state. The view is breathtaking—spires of gold and glass piercing the clouds, lit by the artificial sun. But to Angelica, it is a cage. The elevator panel flashes a red "LOCKDOWN" icon. Behind her, the heavy boots of the Wardens thunder on the marble floor. She is trapped at the 500th floor, with a drop of three miles to the Undercity below.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica weighs her options. Surrender means execution or vivisection by Vane. Fighting means death by plasma fire. The window offers a third option: a 98% chance of death, but a 2% chance of freedom. She chooses the 2%.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Faced with impossible odds, she chooses a high-risk leap over surrender, demonstrating her extreme resolve to stay free.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Two percent. I can work with two percent."

### Scene 3: The Leap (Into the Void)

- **Key Event:** Angelica commands Aeon to disintegrate the window.
- **Detailed Description:** She places her hand against the reinforced hyper-glass. It is cold and vibrates with the wind outside. "Aeon! Entropy! Now!" The gryphon unleashes a pulse of temporal decay. The glass doesn't shatter; it ages. In a second, it turns brittle, cracks, and then dissolves into sand. The wind of the high atmosphere roars into the corridor, sucking loose papers and debris out into the sky.
- **Internal Conflict:** Terror grips her. The lizard brain screams at her not to jump. But the sound of a plasma bolt hitting the wall next to her head overrides the fear. She steps back, takes a breath, and runs.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Aeon! Entropy! Now!"

- **Key Event:** Angelica jumps into the open air of the Zenith.
- **Detailed Description:** She clears the ledge. For a moment, there is weightlessness. The wind roars in her ears, tearing at her clothes. She is falling past the golden spires, a grey smudge against the shining city. The Wardens rush to the broken window, watching her fall, assuming she has chosen suicide.

### Scene 4: The Descent (Freefall)

- **Key Event:** Angelica uses a Mag-Lev Grappling Hook to intercept a drone.
- **Detailed Description:** The wind is deafening. Angelica is in a terminal velocity dive. Her eyes water, blurring the lights of the traffic lanes below. She spots a heavy sanitation drone—a garbage scow—moving in a lower lane. She pulls the Mag-Lev Grappling Hook she scavenged from Solon's office. It is a prototype, unstable and heavy. She aims, leading the target, and fires. The magnetic head clamps onto the drone's hull with a spark of blue light. The line goes taut.
- **Internal Conflict:** The sudden deceleration nearly dislocates her shoulder. She screams in pain but holds on. She swings wildly beneath the drone, smashing through a holographic billboard advertising "Perfection." The irony is lost on her as she fights to stabilize her swing.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her identity as a resilient survivor is reinforced by her ability to laugh in the face of near-death as she crashes through the advertisement.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Gravity is just a law, and I am a criminal."

- **Key Event:** The Crash Landing.
- **Detailed Description:** The drone's course takes it over a waste-processing plant in the Mid-Levels. Angelica cuts the line. She falls the last fifty feet, crashing through a rot-canvas awning and landing in a massive dumpster filled with bio-waste and shredded paper. The impact knocks the wind out of her. She lies there, staring up at the distant, glittering Spire she just escaped. She is covered in garbage, bleeding, and bruised, but she is alive.
- **Internal Conflict:** She feels a strange, hysterical joy. She beat the odds. She beat Vane. She spits out a piece of packing foam and checks her pocket. The data-chip is still there. The game is on.

### Scene 5: The Shadow

- **Key Event:** Joyce tracks the target.
- **Detailed Description:** On a maintenance gantry overlooking the waste-processing plant, **Joyce (The Needle)** lowers her rifle scope. She watched the entire descent—the shattered window, the grappling hook catch, the crash landing. Her contract from Lady Vesper said to observe and report, not eliminate. Not yet. The Ward girl has skills. That complicates the price. She activates her encrypted comm and sends a single-word assessment: _"Survived."_ Then she melts into the industrial steam, her presence never detected.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce (to her comm):** "Target survived the fall. Tracking to Mid-Levels. Contract status: observation phase continues."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Joyce** — Her professional detachment is absolute; she watches a potential victim escape death with the same interest as a scientist observing an experiment.
