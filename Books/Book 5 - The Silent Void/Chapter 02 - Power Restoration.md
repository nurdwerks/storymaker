### Scene 1: The Engineering Deck (The Sleeping Giant)

- **Key Event:** The survivors reach the Engineering Deck to restore power.
- **Detailed Description:** The Engineering Deck is a cavernous, industrial cathedral. The ceiling is lost in darkness five stories up. Massive turbines, silent for centuries, line the walls like sleeping titans. The air is frigid, breath misting in the flashlight beams. The floor is covered in a layer of dust and frozen condensation. In the center of the room stands the Main Reactor Console, a monolith of dead screens and manual levers. The silence is heavy, pressing against the ears.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet feels a magnetic pull toward the console. To her, the dead machine feels like a stopped heart. She is eager to jumpstart it, but also terrified of the surge. She checks her neural shunts, knowing they are already fried from previous overloads. She knows this might kill her, but the ship needs a pulse.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It's too quiet. A machine this size should have a heartbeat. It feels... dead."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "It's in a coma. I have to wake it up. But it might scream when I do."

- **Key Event:** Lisbet jacks directly into the terminal.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet connects her neural cable to the universal port. She doesn't use a keyboard; she uses her mind. As the connection establishes, a spark of blue electricity arcs from the console to her neck. She convulses, her back arching as raw, unregulated voltage floods her system. Her eyes roll back, glowing with internal light. The turbines begin to spin up with a low, bone-shaking groan. Lights flicker on sequentially down the length of the hall, revealing the immense scale of the engine room.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet rides the lightning. The pain is exquisite—a burning cold that sharpens her senses. She feels the ship's architecture mapping itself onto her brain. She sees the fuel lines, the air ducts, the gravity plating. For a moment, she is the ship. She feels the immense power of the reactor coming online, a sun igniting in her chest.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Displays a high tolerance for pain and a deep connection to technology, enjoying the "raw" voltage of the ancient ship. She treats the electric shock like a drug.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "The voltage is raw. No regulators. It kicks like a mule. It tastes like... aluminum and thunderstorms."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **AI (system voice):** "Main Bus B active. Life Support at 12%. Atmospheric scrubbers engaged. Gravity localized. Welcome back, Crew."

### Scene 2: The Signal (The Dark Forest)

- **Key Event:** The ship's AI detects an incoming signal.
- **Detailed Description:** As the main viewscreen flickers to life, a waveform appears—a jagged, red line pulsing against a black background. It is a deep-space transmission. The AI voice, flat and synthetic, announces: "Contact detected. Origin: Unknown. vector: Inbound. Protocol 9 engaged: Silent Running." The lights immediately dim to a low red combat setting. The hum of the engines drops to a whisper. The ship effectively holds its breath.
- **Internal Conflict:** General Ironwood stiffens. His military training kicks in. A signal means an enemy. He reaches for the weapons console, his hand hovering over the manual override. He wants to scan, to target, to fight. He feels exposed.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "We're being hailed. Or targeted. We need to respond. Bring weapons online. We show them teeth."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. Look at the protocol. 'Silent Running.' The ship hid itself automatically. It knows something we don't."

- **Key Event:** Angelica orders the ship to remain dark.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica steps between Ironwood and the console. She looks at the waveform. It repeats every prime number of seconds. It isn't a greeting; it's a sweep. A radar ping. If they power up the main drive or the comms array, they will light up like a flare in the dark. The realization hits her: the galaxy isn't empty; it's hunting.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica battles the urge to call for help. They are lost and alone. A signal could mean rescue. But her gut—honed by years in the Undercity—tells her that in the dark, noise attracts predators. She chooses silence. She chooses to be a ghost.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Decides to prioritize caution and stealth, refusing to override the ship's hiding protocols until they know who is looking. She asserts command over the General.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The ship isn't dead. It's just holding its breath. And it's terrified. We stay quiet."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "We're the rats in the walls. And something is hunting the house. I know a hunter's sweep when I see one."

### Scene 3: The Philosophy (Survival of the Quietest)

- **Key Event:** Hatcher reflects on survival.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher leans against a bulkhead, cleaning his shotgun. He watches the younger members of the crew panic. He has survived the collapse of the Zenith, the Stone Season, and the fall. He recognizes the smell of fear. He lights a cigarette, the smoke drifting into the air scrubbers.
- **Internal Conflict:** Hatcher feels old. He wonders if he has one more fight left in him. He looks at Angelica and sees the weight on her shoulders. He decides to be her anchor. He knows that survival isn't about being the strongest; it's about being the last one noticed.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "I've been dead before. Twice in the Stone Season alone. Death keeps sending invitations—I keep marking them 'Return to Sender.' We stay quiet, we stay alive. Simple as that."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "If we hide, we starve."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "If we scream, we die today. Starving takes weeks. I'll take weeks."
