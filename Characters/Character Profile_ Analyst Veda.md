# Character Profile: Analyst Veda

**Archetype:** The Cold Mathematician / The Predictor
**True Sin:** PRIDE (She believes her algorithms can predict all human behavior and that she is superior to the "unpredictable" emotions of others).
**Virtue Mask:** PRECISION (She frames her refusal to help as "Adhering to the Probability Model").

## I. Role in the Story

Analyst Veda is a woman who uses high-speed computers to predict the outcome of Aris's experiments. She views the world as a series of probabilities.

- **The Prediction:** She tells Angelica that her chance of success is "statistically zero," delivering this crushing news with a flat, bored tone.
- **The Wall:** Her absolute belief in the numbers makes Angelica's struggle feel futile, as if she is fighting against the laws of physics themselves.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Statistical Anomaly / Betrayal. Veda discovers a data-set that proves Aris’s plan has a 100% failure rate for the survival of the human species. She tries to hide this from Aris, realizing that his obsession is a threat to the world.
- **Impact on Dr. Aris:** Aris discovers her "omission" and realizes that his most reliable predictor has turned against him. He strips Veda of her authority and relegates her to the "Silt-side Observation" sub-team, effectively exiling her from the inner circle.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Prediction" is lost. The research team no longer knows what the goal of their experiments is, leading to a state of existential dread as they realize they are working for a man whose plan is mathematically doomed.
