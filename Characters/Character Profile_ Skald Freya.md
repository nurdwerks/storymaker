# Character Profile: Skald Freya

**Archetype:** The Voice of Glory / The Storyteller
**True Sin:** PRIDE (She believes she has the power to decide whose life is "glorious" enough to be remembered).
**Virtue Mask:** ARTISTRY (She claims her bias is just "Divine Inspiration" or "The Will of the Spirits").

## I. Role in the Story

Skald Freya is the storyteller who sings the songs of Ragnar’s deeds. She is the keeper of the Warband's cultural identity and their sense of immortality.

- **The Erasure:** She refuses to sing about Angelica, actively erasing the protagonist's contributions to their survival from the tribe's memory.
- **The Scorn:** "There is no glory in a machine-witch," she says, dismissing magic as a "Zenith soft-skin" trick that has no place in a warrior's song.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Loss of Voice / Maiming. Freya is captured by a Zenith interrogator who, recognizing her role as the "voice" of the rebellion, surgically removes her tongue and vocal cords. She is left alive but unable to sing or speak.
- **Impact on Ragnar:** The Warband loses its spirit. Ragnar realizes that without Freya to sing of their deeds, they are just "savages" who will be forgotten by history. He becomes increasingly desperate to leave a mark on the world.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Songs" stop. The atmosphere of the camp becomes grim and silent, as the warriors realize that their mortality is now absolute; there is no one left to sing them into legend.

**Event Location:** Book 6, Chapter 15
**Defining Quote:** _"A singer without a voice is a bird with no wings. She is useless to me now."_ — Ragnar

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | Skald Freya, accompanied by two young hunters, is ambushed by a scouting party of "Sky-Demons" (Hunter-Scouts) while collecting river clay for the forge. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | The riverbank is shrouded in morning mist. Freya kneels in the mud, humming a melody as she digs for the red clay needed to line the new blast furnace. The silence of the jungle is broken not by a roar, but by a high-pitched mechanical whine. Three Hunter-Scouts, clad in sleek, vacuum-sealed stealth suits that shimmer like oil on water, drop from the canopy. They move with unnatural, jerky speed. The two young hunters, armed only with flint spears, are dead before they can scream—their chests pierced by silent, needle-thin projectiles. Freya tries to run, but a bola made of mono-filament wire wraps around her legs, slicing into her skin and bringing her down. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | *Internal Conflict | Freya experiences sheer, paralyzing terror. She has sung songs of monsters and heroes, but the reality of the Zenith technology is beyond her comprehension. She realizes that her stories offered no protection against enemies who do not fear the spirits. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Dialog | **Freya (Internal):** "The song stops here. The spirits are deaf." |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | The Hunters capture Freya and drag her into the undergrowth, intending to interrogate her about the location of the "Architect" (Angelica). |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | The Hunters do not speak. They communicate in clicks and chirps. They drag Freya by her hair, ignoring her struggles. They are looking for intel. They set up a portable field-interrogation unit—a small, humming device with surgical attachments. The lead Hunter, a cyborg with a faceless helmet, leans over her. He projects a hologram of Angelica's face and points to the north. When Freya spits in his face, he activates a laser-scalpel. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | To punish her defiance and silence the "voice" of the tribe, the Hunters surgically remove Freya's tongue and vocal cords. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | The procedure is performed with terrifying, clinical precision. There is no anger in the Hunter's action, only efficiency. The laser cauterizes the wound instantly, leaving the smell of burnt meat hanging in the humid air. Freya tries to scream, but only a wet, gurgling sound emerges. The pain is blinding, white-hot, but the psychological horror is worse. She feels the vibration of her own silence. The Hunters leave her bleeding in the mud as bait, knowing her screams (or lack thereof) will draw the warriors. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | *Internal Conflict | Freya's identity shatters. She was the Skald. She was the memory of the people. Without her voice, she is nothing. She lies in the dirt, clutching her throat, and realizes she has become a ghost while still alive. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | Ragnar moves through the jungle like a landslide. He roars, a sound of pure primal rage that shakes the trees. He wields his iron axe with terrifying strength, cleaving the lead Hunter in two through the shoulder. The other Hunters attempt to retreat, but are pinned down by the tribe's archers. Ragnar does not take prisoners. He butchers the enemy with a brutality that shocks even his own men. He finds Freya curled in the roots of a banyan tree, covered in blood. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | *Internal Conflict | Ragnar feels a surge of protective fury. Freya is his Skald. She belongs to him. An attack on her is an insult to his legend. He drops his axe and kneels beside her, expecting her to sing of his victory. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | Ragnar discovers the nature of Freya's injury and realizes she can no longer sing. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | He lifts her chin, his hands stained with alien blood. He tells her to speak, to name the ones who did this. Freya opens her mouth, revealing the charred ruin of her throat. She makes a desperate, rasping sound, tears streaming down her face. Ragnar stares into her mouth, his expression shifting from concern to horror, and then to cold, hard disgust. He pulls his hand away as if she is contagious. He stands up, wiping her blood on his furs. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | *Internal Conflict | Ragnar's empathy is overridden by his utilitarian worldview. In his mind, a person is defined by their function. A warrior fights. A builder builds. A singer sings. Freya is broken. She is a tool that can no longer perform its task. He feels cheated—who will remember his deeds now? His pity curdles into resentment. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Key Event | Torin and Angelica arrive at the scene. Angelica stabilizes Freya with a med-kit, while Torin confronts Ragnar. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | Angelica works quickly, applying bio-foam to Freya's throat and injecting a painkiller. She holds Freya's hand, whispering reassurances. Torin stands toe-to-toe with Ragnar, furious at the Warlord's cruelty. Ragnar ignores him, signaling his men to move out. He does not look back at the woman who spent her life glorifying him. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | Usually, a return is met with chanting and drums. Tonight, the camp is quiet. The warriors sit by the fires, cleaning their weapons in silence. They look at Freya, who sits in the shadows with bandages around her neck, and they look away. The silence is a physical weight. It is the sound of their own mortality. Without the Skald, they are just men killing in the mud, with no legacy. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | *Internal Conflict | Angelica observes the collapse of morale. She realizes that Ragnar's power was built on the story, not just the strength. By discarding Freya, he has cracked the foundation of his own rule. She sits with Freya, offering her a datapad and a stylus. She teaches Freya to write the first word: "Voice." |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "You don't need a tongue to tell the truth, Freya. Ink lasts longer than breath." |
