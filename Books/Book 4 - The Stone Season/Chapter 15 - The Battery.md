- **Key Event:** The group finds a single, fully-charged "Zenith Core" battery in an abandoned cargo lift, but they must choose between using it for heat or for a one-time radio transmission.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "The signal reach the Spire remnants. We could call for an extraction. We could be saved."

### Scene 4: The Betrayal

- **Key Event:** The "rescue" signal is traced not by a friendly force, but by a fleet of **Vane's Nulls**, who use the signal to pinpoint their location for an orbital strike.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Realizes the error too late, having failed to account for Vane’s control over the comms-net.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "It's not a rescue. It's a target-lock. We just gave them the coordinates."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Run. Run now!"
