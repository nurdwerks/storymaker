# Chapter 3: The Silver Scythe

The Imperial Library was burning.

It wasn't a fire of wood and paper, though there was plenty of that. It was a fire of plasma and ozone, the superheated air shimmering like a mirage in the cavernous rotunda. The smell was unique—the scent of burning history. It tasted like copper and old dust on the back of Angelica’s throat.

She slid across the polished marble floor, her knees scraping against the stone, and slammed into the base of a heavy reading table. A split second later, a volley of plasma bolts hammered into the bust of a Founder mounted on the wall above her previous position. The stone head exploded, showering the area with marble shrapnel.

"Target heading for the east wing!" a voice boomed over the tactical network, amplified by the library's acoustics. "Cut her off! Lethal force authorized!"

Angelica pressed her back against the cold stone of the table. Her breath came in ragged gasps. Her hands were shaking, not from fear, but from the adrenaline dump of a body in survival mode. She clutched the data-chip she had pulled from Solon’s dead hand. It was warm, sticky with his blood.

*They killed him,* she thought, the realization hitting her again like a physical blow. *They killed an Archon just to keep a secret.*

And now they were going to kill her.

She looked at her shoulder. A small, metallic shape was perched there, its claws digging into the fabric of her training fatigues. It looked like a bird made of brass gears and glass lenses.

"Aeon," she whispered. "Wake up."

The construct shifted. Its glass eyes flickered, glowing with a faint, amber light. It let out a soft *whirrr* of gears coming up to speed. To anyone else, it was just a toy, a clockwork curiosity. To Angelica, it was the only thing standing between her and a summary execution. Aeon wasn't just a pet; he was a combat multiplier.

"Analysis," the gryphon chattered, its voice a series of clicks and hums that resonated directly in her skull via their neural link. "Threat level: Critical. Enemy count: Twelve hostile units. Armament: Class-4 Plasma Rifles, Suppression Shields, Stun Batons. Escape vectors: Limited. Probability of survival: 12.4%."

"Twelve percent," Angelica muttered, wiping sweat from her forehead. "Better than zero. I can work with twelve. What's the variable?"

"Variable: Structural instability of the north wall. Variable: Enemy overconfidence. Variable: User's willingness to sustain injury."

"High," she answered immediately. "The willingness is high."

She peeked around the edge of the table.

The main doors of the library had been breached. A squad of twelve Wardens in full tactical gear was advancing into the room. They moved with professional efficiency, sweeping their sectors, their pulse-rifles raised. The red laser sights cut through the smoke, scanning for movement. They were the elite—Vane's personal Praetorians. Their armor was distinct from the standard city guard; it was matte white, designed to diffuse laser impacts, with gold filigree etching the pauldrons. They weren't here to arrest her. They were here to erase her. They moved in a phalanx formation, shields overlapping, creating a wall of moving ceramite.

Angelica recognized the tactics. Vane had designed them. "The Suppression Grid." It was a maneuver designed to corral a target into a kill zone. They were pushing her toward the center of the room, away from the exits. She could hear the hum of their localized dampening fields, tech designed to suppress unauthorized broadcasts. They were locking the room down electronically as well as physically.

She glanced at a display case near her hand. It held a First Era tome, bound in real leather. *The Ethics of Command.* She grabbed the heavy book. It felt solid, real. A relic of a time when leaders pretended to have morals.

Behind them, the Captain she had confronted earlier was shouting orders. He wanted her dead before she could upload whatever was on the chip.

"Sector 4 clear!"

"Sector 5 clear! Moving to the stacks!"

Their voices were distorted by their helmet comms, sounding like robotic growls.

Angelica looked up. The library was a multi-level structure, a series of concentric balconies rising toward the crystal dome high above. The "East Wing" the Captain had mentioned was a narrow corridor leading to the executive offices. If she could get there, she might find another way down. Or up.

But the way was blocked. Two Wardens were flanking her position, moving to pin her against the wall.

She needed a distraction.

She looked at the row of data-stacks next to her. They were massive, floor-to-ceiling servers made of black iron and glass, humming with the stored knowledge of the Zenith. They were heavy.

"Aeon," she said. "Leverage."

The gryphon understood. It hopped from her shoulder to the floor. It didn't grow in size, but its density shifted. Aeon could manipulate his own mass, anchoring himself with the weight of a tank or becoming as light as a feather. He latched onto the base of the nearest data-stack, his claws digging into the steel. His gears spun up to a high-pitched whine, the sound of a turbine engine spooling.

"Push," Angelica commanded. "Hard."

She slammed her shoulder into the stack, adding her own strength to the construct's mechanical torque. She grunted with the effort, her boots sliding on the polished floor.

For a second, nothing happened. The stack was bolted to the floor.

Then, the bolts sheared. *PING. PING.*

With a groan of stressed metal that sounded like a dying whale, the stack tipped.

It fell like a tree.

*CRASH.*

The sound was deafening, a cacophony of shattering glass and twisting steel. The heavy server smashed into the next one, creating a domino effect. One stack hit two, two hit four. The library became an avalanche of information. Sparks showered the room as power conduits sheared, arcing blue lightning across the floor.

The Wardens on the flank shouted in alarm, scrambling back as tons of equipment crashed down. The formation broke. The wall of shields shattered as men dived for cover. The orderly advance turned into chaos.

"Move!" Angelica shouted to herself.

She broke cover. She sprinted for the spiral staircase leading to the mezzanine level.

Bolts sizzled past her. One singed the sleeve of her fatigues, leaving a black burn mark on her skin. She didn't slow down. She hit the stairs, taking them three at a time.

"She's climbing!" a Warden yelled. " suppression fire!"

The railing next to her hand vaporized. Angelica threw herself flat, crawling up the last few steps on her belly. She rolled onto the landing and scrambled behind a marble pillar.

She was on the second level. Below, the library was a war zone of smoke and flashing lights. The Wardens were regrouping, moving to secure the stairs.

She checked the chip again. It was still there. *The Cylinder,* Solon's note had said. *The truth is in the—*

She didn't know what the truth was. But she knew it was worth dying for. Or killing for.

She looked down the long corridor of the East Wing. It was empty. But at the far end, she saw the glint of a sniper scope. A Warden was positioned on the balcony opposite, covering the hallway.

If she stepped out, she was dead.

"Aeon," she hissed. "Flash mode. Maximum output. Burn it out."

The gryphon hopped back onto her shoulder. Its eyes whirred, the lenses rotating like the shutter of a camera. The amber light turned to a blinding magnesium white. It began to strobe, faster and faster, building a charge. The air around the construct hummed with static electricity, making the hair on Angelica's arms stand up.

"Charging," Aeon reported. "Capacitors at 110%. Warning: Thermal damage imminent."

"Do it!"

Angelica stepped out from behind the pillar, squeezing her eyes shut and shielding them with her arm. She turned her head away, pressing her face into the crook of her elbow. She felt the heat of the buildup on her shoulder, a physical pressure wave of photons.

"NOW!"

Aeon unleashed the pulse.

The sound was a sharp *CRACK*, like a thunderclap in a jar. The light that followed was not just illumination; it was a physical force. It stripped the shadows from the room, bleaching the world white. For a nanosecond, Angelica saw the bones in her own arm through her eyelids.

It wasn't just light. It was a photonic assault. It was a wall of magnesium-white luminance that flooded the library, bouncing off the polished marble and the crystal dome, amplifying its intensity. It was brighter than a star going supernova. It didn't just blind; it burned.

Below, the Wardens screamed. Their tactical visors, designed to amplify low light, were instantly overloaded. The safety cutouts failed under the sheer magnitude of the surge. Screens went white, then black. Sensors fused.

"My eyes! I can't see!"

"Visor failure! Rebooting! Rebooting!"

They fired blindly, plasma bolts going wild, scorching the ceiling and the walls. The orderly squad was reduced to a cluster of flailing, blinded men. One Warden stumbled into a data-stack, knocking it over. Another fired his weapon into the floor, melting a hole in the marble.

Angelica squeezed her eyes shut, trusting her memory of the corridor. She ran. She counted her steps. *One, two, three, turn left. Five steps to the door.* She felt the heat of a plasma bolt pass inches from her ear, smelling the singed hair.

She heard the sniper fire blindly. The bolt hit the ceiling, showering her with plaster dust. She kept running.

She reached the end of the hall. A heavy blast door barred the way to the executive lift. She slapped the panel.

*ACCESS DENIED. LOCKDOWN IN EFFECT.*

"Damn it," she hissed.

She looked back. The light was fading. The Wardens were recovering. She could hear the heavy thud of boots on the stairs. They were coming.

She was trapped.

She looked to her right. The corridor ended in a massive, floor-to-ceiling panoramic window. It was a sheet of hyper-glass, three inches thick, designed to withstand hurricane-force winds and orbital debris.

She walked to it. She pressed her hands against the glass. It was cold, vibrating slightly with the wind pressure outside.

Outside, the Zenith spread out in all its glory. The golden spires, the floating gardens, the streams of traffic that looked like rivers of liquid light. It was beautiful. It was a masterpiece of engineering. It was a city built on clouds, held up by antigravity and arrogance.

And it was three thousand feet down to the smog layer. And another two thousand feet below that to the ground.

*If I jump, I die,* her lizard brain screamed. *It's too high. It's suicide.*

*If I stay, I die,* her logical brain countered. *Vane will peel me apart to see how the Sangreal works.*

Behind her, a plasma bolt hit the doorframe, showering her with molten sparks. The Captain was advancing, using the doorframe for cover. He wasn't rushing; he knew he had her trapped.

"Give it up, Ward!" the Captain shouted from the other end of the hall. "There's nowhere to go! The elevator is locked. The window is reinforced. You are in a box!"

Angelica looked at the drop. She looked at the traffic lanes far below. The wind whipped her hair across her face, stinging her eyes. She remembered her flight training in the Academy. *The harness catches you. Gravity is a variable.* But she had no harness. She had no grav-chute. She only had physics and desperation.

"Two percent," she whispered. "I'll take the fall over the knife."

She turned to Aeon. "Entropy."

The gryphon looked at the glass. It understood. Its primary function—the manipulation of time—could be weaponized. It could age an object to dust in seconds.

"Aeon! Entropy! Now!"

The construct leaped from her shoulder and latched onto the center of the window. A wave of grey energy pulsed from its body—the color of old ash, of fading photographs.

The hyper-glass didn't shatter. It *aged*.

In a second, the crystal turned cloudy. Then yellow. Then brittle. Cracks spiderwebbed across the surface, not from impact, but from the weight of time accelerated a million-fold. The molecular bonds that held the silica together weakened, forgetting their purpose. It was entropy weaponized—the acceleration of the inevitable.

The wind outside roared, sensing the weakness. It pressed against the dying glass, a physical force demanding entry. It was a hurricane waiting to happen, a monster clawing at the door. The pressure differential was immense, suction pulling at the cracks, making the glass sing a high, mournful note.

Angelica stepped back. She took a breath. She looked at the Captain, who was raising his rifle. His face was a mask of grim determination. He knew she was cornered. He knew he had won. He fired. The bolt of blue energy streaked toward her chest, humming with lethal potential.

Time seemed to slow. She saw the rifling on the energy bolt. She saw the dilation of the Captain's pupils. She saw the dust motes dancing in the beam of light from Aeon.

"Not today," she said.

She didn't just run; she launched herself. Every muscle in her legs fired at once, a desperate kinetic explosion. She wasn't aiming for the window; she was aiming *through* it.

She hit the glass with her shoulder just as the bolt impacted the wall where she had been standing, melting the marble into slag. The glass didn't break; it disintegrated. It turned into a cloud of silica dust and sand that puffed out into the void, carried away by the wind like a ghost.

She fell out into the sky.

The transition from the sterile, climate-controlled air of the Palace to the raw atmosphere of the Zenith was violent. The cold hit her like a hammer. The wind was deafening, a physical assault on her senses. She was tumbling, spinning out of control in a void of grey and gold.

For a heartbeat, there was only terror. Pure, unadulterated primate panic. Her stomach was in her throat, her heart was trying to beat its way out of her chest. The ground was miles away, but it was rushing up to meet her with terrifying speed.

*I'm going to die,* she thought. *This was a mistake. I should have surrendered.*

Then, training kicked in. Or maybe it was just stubbornness.

*No,* she corrected herself. *I am flying. It's just... aggressive flying.*

***

The silence of the fall was a lie.

It wasn't silent. The wind screamed. It tore at her clothes, stinging her eyes, filling her mouth. It was a physical force, a wall of air that battered her as she tumbled. It roared like a jet engine, drowning out her own scream.

For a moment, there was only vertigo. The world spun—gold spires, black sky, grey clouds. Up and down lost their meaning. Her stomach lurched into her throat, and her vision grayed out at the edges. The g-force of the tumble was disorienting.

*Stabilize,* she told herself. *You are a bird. You are a leaf. Do not fight the wind. Ride it.*

She forced herself to open her eyes. The wind dried them instantly, making them burn.

She was falling past the habitation spires of Sector 1. She saw flashes of lives inside the windows, frozen vignettes of the Highborn existence she was rejecting. She saw a family eating dinner under a crystal chandelier. She saw a woman reading a book in a floating chair. She saw a child playing with a gravity-ball. They were inches away, separated by glass and velocity. They didn't see the girl falling to her death. They were safe in their bubbles. She was in the chaos.

She spread her arms and legs, fighting the air resistance. She managed to stabilize her tumble, turning her uncontrolled fall into a delta-dive. She angled her body, steering with her hands.

Below her, the traffic lanes were rivers of light. Hover-cars, cargo drones, personal transports. They were moving fast, zipping along magnetic rails invisible to the naked eye.

"Aeon!" she screamed, though she couldn't hear herself. "Target!"

The gryphon, clinging to the back of her vest with magnetic claws, chirped a datum directly into her ear. *Trajectory calculated. Intercept vector: Sanitation Drone 449. Distance: 500 feet. Time to impact: 8 seconds.*

Angelica looked down. She saw it. A heavy, lumbering garbage scow moving in the lower commercial lane. It was ugly, scarred, and slow. Perfect.

She reached for her belt. She still had the Mag-Lev Grappling Hook she had stolen from the Museum's maintenance closet—part of her original escape plan that had gone wrong.

It was a prototype. Unstable. Heavy.

She unclipped it. Her fingers were numb from the cold.

*Six seconds.*

She aimed. She had to lead the target. The drone was moving laterally; she was moving vertically. It was a math problem. A physics equation written in adrenaline and wind shear.

*Four seconds.*

The drone grew larger. She could see the rust on its hull.

*Two seconds.*

She fired.

The hook shot out, trailing a high-tensile mono-filament line. It sparked blue as the magnetic head activated.

It hit the drone.

*CLANG.*

The magnet clamped onto the rear stabilizer fin. The line went taut.

The deceleration was brutal.

Angelica felt her shoulder pop. She screamed, the sound lost in the wind. Her body was whipped around like a rag doll at the end of a string. She swung wildly beneath the massive drone, her feet kicking empty air.

She slammed into something hard. A holographic billboard.

It wasn't just light; it was "hard-light," a solid projection used for high-end advertising. She crashed through the image of a smiling woman holding a bottle of perfume. The woman was fifty feet tall, beautiful and perfect. Angelica punched through her cheek.

The hard-light field stung like static electricity, zapping her skin as she passed through the photon barrier. She tumbled through the ad for "Perfection" and slammed into the rear of the advertisement's emitter array. Her boots skidded on the metal housing.

She swung out the other side, dangling over the abyss. The wire hummed with tension, vibrating like a plucked cello string. Her shoulder felt like it was on fire, the joint screaming in protest.

"Gravity is just a law," she gasped, gritting her teeth against the pain. "And I am a criminal."

She looked up. The drone hadn't even noticed. Its automated systems compensated for the extra weight, firing thrusters to maintain course. It was a dumb machine, following a pre-programmed route. It didn't care that it had a stowaway. It was heading down, toward the processing plants in the Mid-Levels.

Toward the trash.

Angelica hung there, spinning slowly. Above her, the Golden City receded, becoming a distant constellation of artificial stars. The spires of the Highborn looked like jewels on a necklace, beautiful and cold. They were a lie she had lived in for weeks, a dream she had woken up from.

Below, the smog layer of the Undercity rushed up to meet her. It was a brown, roiling ocean of toxic clouds. She could smell it now—the sulfur, the rot, the burning plastic. It smelled like home. It smelled like truth.

She passed through the cloud layer. The light changed instantly. The golden glow of the artificial sun was gone, replaced by the flickering, sickly yellow of sodium-vapor lamps and the neon glare of advertising holograms. The air grew thick and heavy, coating her skin in a film of grease.

She saw the layers of the city passing by like strata in a canyon. The High-Mid levels, where the merchants lived in comfortable apartments. The Low-Mid levels, where the factories churned out goods for the Zenith. The Silt, where the forgotten lived in the rust.

She was falling through the class system, one second at a time.

She looked at the city she was leaving. The Zenith. It was a parasite, sucking the life from the planet below to fuel its own golden dreams. Vane sat at the top, a spider in a web of light.

*I'm coming back,* she promised the receding spires. *I'm coming back with a torch.*

She checked her pocket. The chip was still there. She pressed her hand against it, verifying its shape. It was the only thing that mattered.

She laughed. It was a jagged, hysterical sound that was snatched away by the wind. It was the laugh of someone who had cheated the reaper. Her hands were shaking so hard she had to grip the railing of the drone until her knuckles turned white. She was freezing, the adrenaline crash hitting her hard. But she was free.

She rode the garbage truck down, a queen on a throne of refuse.

***

The crash landing was less graceful.

The drone's route took it over the waste-processing plant in Sector 7. It hovered over a massive, open-air dumpster, preparing to dump its load.

Angelica didn't wait to be dumped. She cut the line.

She fell the last thirty feet.

She crashed through a rot-canvas awning that had been stretched over the bay to keep the rain off the machinery. The fabric tore with a loud *RIP*, slowing her down just enough to prevent broken bones.

She landed in the dumpster.

It was filled with shredded paper, bio-waste, and packing foam. It was soft, but it smelled like death.

The impact knocked the wind out of her. She lay there, staring up at the square of grey sky framed by the dumpster's rim. She gasped for air, her ribs aching.

She was alive.

She sat up, pushing aside a pile of shredded documents. She was covered in filth. Her white training fatigues were stained brown and green. Her arm was bleeding again where the stitches had torn.

She climbed out of the dumpster, dropping onto the metal grating of the gantry.

She was in the Mid-Levels. The air here was thicker, humid and smelling of oil and old food. The lights were yellow sodium-vapor, buzzing with insects.

She checked her pockets. The knife was there. The grappling hook handle was gone, lost in the fall. The chip...

She pulled it out. It was smeared with grime, but intact.

She looked up at the distant, glittering spire of the Palace. It looked like a needle scratching the sky.

"You missed," she whispered.

She turned and limped into the shadows of the industrial steam. She needed to find a terminal. She needed to find Hatcher. She needed to disappear.

She moved through the plant, using the noise of the crushers to mask her footsteps. The air was filled with the deafening *CLANG-CRUNCH* of metal being compacted. It was a rhythm she knew well. The heartbeat of the industrial machine that kept the Zenith shiny.

Workers in hazmat suits moved around the perimeter, bored and tired. They pushed carts of refuse, checked gauges, and stared blankly at their datapads. They didn't look up. In the Mid-Levels, you learned not to look at things that didn't concern you. Curiosity got you fired, or worse. If a girl covered in garbage fell from the sky, it was none of their business. It was just another piece of trash for the pile.

Angelica slipped between the shadows of the machinery. She moved with the fluid grace of a predator, despite her injuries. She passed a break room where workers were drinking synth-caf. She paused, watching them. They looked exhausted, their faces grey with fatigue. She felt a sudden, fierce protectiveness. These were the people Vane was erasing.

She stole a heavy canvas tarp from a pile of supplies and wrapped it around her shoulders like a cloak, hiding her white uniform. It smelled of oil and mildew, a perfect camouflage. She rubbed grease on her face, masking the clean, healthy skin she had acquired in the Palace. She was de-evolving, shedding the Zenith to survive.

She found a service ladder and began the climb down to the street level. Her arm burned, sending spikes of agony up her neck with every rung, but her mind was cold. She was no longer running. She was maneuvering. She was back in her element. The Zenith had been a game of words and smiles, a game she didn't know how to play. This? This was survival. This was geometry and physics. This was a game she could win.

***

High above, on a rusting maintenance gantry overlooking the waste plant, a figure watched.

Joyce lowered her long-range rifle. The scope was still tracking the girl's heat signature as she vanished into the maze of pipes. The rifle was a custom build, disguised as a walking cane when collapsed. It fired needle-thin rounds that dissolved on impact—untraceable.

Joyce was small, frail-looking, bundled in a hand-knit cardigan that smelled of mothballs. She looked like a grandmother who had gotten lost on her way to the market. She had a bag of hard candies in her pocket and a picture of a cat in her locket. But her hands were steady as stone, and her eyes, magnified by thick spectacles, were cold and calculating. She was a relic of the Old Intelligence Division, a sleeper agent who had never quite woken up.

She hummed a little tune as she packed the rifle away. *Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of posies...* A nursery rhyme for the plague. Fitting.

She tapped her earpiece.

"Target survived the fall," she said, her voice a soft, tremulous quaver that masked the steel beneath. "Tracking to Mid-Levels. Sector 7. She has the package."

A voice crackled in her ear. Lady Vesper. Cold, impatient. *"Does she know she's being followed?"*

"No, dear," Joyce said, packing her rifle into a floral carpet-bag. "She thinks she's clever. She thinks she's a ghost. But ghosts don't leave footprints."

Joyce smiled. It was a gentle, terrifying smile.

"Contract status: Observation phase continues. I'll keep an eye on her. She's... interesting."

She stood up, leaning heavily on her cane, and shuffled toward the exit. To any observer, she was just an old woman finding her way home. But inside the bag, the rifle clicked against a box of high-explosive rounds.

The game had moved to the board. And Joyce was the one holding the needle.

***

In the lower levels of Sector 4, inside a cramped apartment that smelled of stale beer and cheap incense, Zephyr sat cleaning his pistol. He was a smuggler, a thief, and—occasionally—a friend. He had the news feed playing on a cracked holoscreen in the corner.

"Manhunt... Murder... Traitor..."

He watched the footage of the library explosion. He saw the blur of white motion that was Angelica.

"Crazy girl," he muttered, shaking his head. He polished the barrel of his gun with a dirty rag. "I told her the Highborn play for keeps. She never listens."

He looked at the locket hanging from his belt—the one Angelica had given him as payment in the first book. It was heavy gold, worth a fortune. He should have sold it weeks ago. He should have taken the credits and bought a ticket to the outer colonies.

But he hadn't.

"Damn it," he sighed. He stood up, holstering the weapon. He grabbed his coat. "Guess I'm not retiring yet."

He kicked the door open and walked out into the smog. He owed her. And Zephyr always paid his debts. Eventually.

***

In the Sanctum of the Prelate, High Prelate Vane stood before a wall of monitors. The feed from the library played on a loop. He watched Angelica jump. He watched the glass age and crumble.

He didn't look angry. He looked fascinated.

"Entropy," he whispered. "She can manipulate entropy."

He rewound the footage. He zoomed in on the creature on her shoulder. The clockwork bird.

"The Artificer's Gryphon," he murmured. "I thought they were extinct."

He turned to the empty room. "She is not just a Sangreal. She is a Catalyst. She accelerated the decay of high-tensile silica by a factor of... millions."

He walked to his desk. He picked up a scalpel and toyed with it.

"Let her run," he said to the air. "Let her find her little friends. Stress tests the metal. If she breaks, she was useless. If she survives..."

He smiled, and it was a terrible thing.

"If she survives, she will be magnificent."

***

Meanwhile, in the gilded calm of the Palace, Lady Corinne sat in her boudoir, brushing her hair.

The news feeds were already spinning the story. "Tragedy at the Archives," the headlines screamed. "Candidate Ward Implicated in Murder." "Manhunt Underway."

Corinne watched the hologram of Angelica's face—a mugshot taken during her intake—rotate in the air. She sipped her tea. It was chamomile, imported from the hydroponic gardens.

"You foolish girl," Corinne whispered to the image. "You ran."

She set the brush down. She looked at her own reflection. Perfect. Porcelain. Empty.

"I would have run too," she admitted to the empty room. "If I had the courage."

She picked up her datapad. She sent a message to her broker. *Sell my shares in Vane-Corp. Buy futures in Security Tech. And see if you can find me a contact in the Mid-Levels. I need a new dressmaker.*

It was a code. It meant: *The game has changed. I'm hedging my bets.*

Corinne smiled. It was a small, secret rebellion. She wasn't a fighter like Angelica. She was a survivor. And survivors knew which way the wind was blowing. Right now, it was blowing a storm up from the Silt.

***

Angelica didn't stop moving for three hours.

She navigated the labyrinth of the Mid-Levels, sticking to the service tunnels and the forgotten maintenance corridors. She avoided the main thoroughfares where the cameras were. She avoided the markets where the crowds were. She stole a cloak from a drying line to cover her ruined clothes. She rubbed grease on her face to mask her features.

She was a shadow.

She reached the rendezvous point Solon had set up as a contingency. It wasn't the Archives. It was a small, derelict clock shop in Sector 9 called "The Ticking Heart."

The shop was closed, the windows boarded up. But the door was unlocked.

Angelica slipped inside.

The air smelled of dust and oil. Thousands of clocks lined the walls—cuckoo clocks, grandfather clocks, digital timers, ancient analog gears. None of them were ticking. They had all stopped at different times.

"Hello?" she called out softly.

A figure stepped out from the back room.

It wasn't Solon. Solon was dead.

It was a man in a trench coat, wearing a fedora pulled low over his eyes. He held a shotgun loosely in one hand.

"You're late," he said. His voice was gravel and smoke.

Angelica tensed, her hand going to her knife. "Who are you?"

The man pushed his hat back. His face was scarred, lined with years of hard living in the Silt. His eyes were tired, but sharp.

"Name's Hatcher," he said. "Solon hired me to keep you alive if he... couldn't."

He looked at the blood on her clothes. He looked at the wild look in her eyes. He saw the way she held her body, favoring her left side, but keeping her right hand free for a weapon. He saw the desperation and the resolve.

"Looks like he got his money's worth," Hatcher grunted. "You look like hell, kid."

"I feel like hell," Angelica admitted, her voice raspy. "But I'm still standing."

"For now," Hatcher said. "Did you get it?"

Angelica hesitated. She didn't know this man. He was a mercenary, a gun for hire. Could she trust him? Solon had trusted him. And Solon was dead.

But she had no one else. She was a fugitive in a city that wanted her erased.

She reached into her pocket and pulled out the chip. It glinted in the dim light.

"I got it," she said.

Hatcher nodded, a slow, appreciative movement. "Good. Then we have work to do. Because every cop in the Zenith is looking for you, kid. And they aren't carrying handcuffs. Vane has authorized a 'terminate on sight' order. You're famous."

He turned and walked into the back room, his trench coat swirling around his ankles. "Coming? Or are you going to stand there and bleed on the floor? I have a med-kit in the back. And whiskey."

Angelica looked at the clocks. Frozen in time. Waiting. They reminded her of the library, of the frozen moment before the chaos began. She realized that her old life—the scavenger, the candidate, the sister—was gone. She was something new now. Something harder.

She followed him.

"I'm coming," she said. "And I don't drink whiskey. I drink water."

Hatcher chuckled, a dry sound like gravel crunching. "We'll see how long that lasts."

The Silver Scythe of the moon rose over the smog of the city, a pale, sharp blade cutting through the dark. It hung there like a promise, or a threat. The night was just beginning.
