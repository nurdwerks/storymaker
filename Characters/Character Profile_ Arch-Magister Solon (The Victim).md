# Character Profile: Arch-Magister Solon (The Victim)

**Archetype:** The Warning / The Ghost **True Sin:** ENVY (He envied Vane’s brilliance, which made him block Vane’s research, leading to Vane’s radicalization). **Virtue Mask:** WISDOM (He posed as the benevolent elder statesman of the Arcanum).

## I. Role in the Story

Solon dies in **Book 2, Chapter 1**. However, his presence lingers.

- **The Body:** His corpse is the clue. The **Ambigram** brand ("AETERNA") on his chest initiates the plot.

- **The Memory:** In **Book 5**, it is revealed that Vane uploaded Solon’s memories before killing him. Solon exists as a "Digital Ghost" in Vane’s head.

- **The Interaction:** Vane argues with Solon in his mind. Solon is the voice of caution that Vane continuously deletes. "You are reckless, Vane." "And you are deleted, Solon."

# Character Profile: Headmaster Thorne (The First Vessel)

**Archetype:** The Bureaucrat / The Weak Link **True Sin:** SLOTH (Moral cowardice. He knew Vane was dangerous, but doing something about it would have risked his tenure). **Virtue Mask:** PRUDENCE (He claimed he was "maintaining academic neutrality").

## I. The Possession (Book 1 Climax)

Thorne is the example of what happens when a weak mind touches the **Old World Spirits** (The Entity's resonance echoes).

- **The Transformation:** Thorne tries to channel the Headmaster's Authority to stop Angelica’s **Berry Gambit**. He opens himself too wide. The Spirit enters.

- **The Horror:** His jaw unhinges. His eyes burn out. He becomes a puppet.

- **The Lesson:** Thorne’s gruesome death at Kaelen’s hands teaches the protagonists that **Authority Figures** are not gods; they are just meat waiting to be butchered. It breaks their conditioning to obey adults.
