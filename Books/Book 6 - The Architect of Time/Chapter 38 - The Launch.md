### Scene 1: The Ignition (The Earth Shakes)

- **Key Event:** Angelica initiates the launch sequence of the _Aeterna_.
- **Detailed Description:** The command deck of the _Aeterna_ vibrates as the primary fusion drives ignite. The sound is not just a roar; it is a physical assault, a low-frequency resonance that rattles the teeth and blurs vision. Outside the viewport, the jungle of the Pre-History valley is instantly vaporized by the exhaust plume, turning centuries of growth into ash in a microsecond. The ground beneath the launch cradle cracks, spiderwebs of fissures spreading out for miles. The ship, a construct of ancient ironwood and scavenged titanium, groans as it fights the grip of gravity.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica grips the armrests of the captain's chair, her knuckles white. The G-force slams her back, compressing her chest. Every instinct screams that the ship will tear itself apart. She built this vessel from scrap and hope, and now she is asking it to defy physics. She feels a profound terror, not for herself, but for the legacy she carries.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She keeps her eyes open, refusing to blink, forcing herself to witness the violence of their departure. She accepts the destruction of her home as the price of survival.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Hold together... just hold together for one more minute. Don't you dare break on me now."

- **Key Event:** The ship clears the launch tower.
- **Detailed Description:** With a scream of tearing metal, the _Aeterna_ breaks free of the clamps. The acceleration increases exponentially. The sky shifts from blue to purple to the black of space in seconds. The hull temperature gauges spike into the red as the atmospheric friction turns the air around them into plasma. Inside, the crew of the tribe screams in terror and exhilaration, their primitive understanding of the world shattered by the reality of spaceflight.

### Scene 2: The Orbit (The Burning World)

- **Key Event:** The ship reaches stable orbit.
- **Detailed Description:** The engine roar cuts out abruptly, replaced by the humming silence of the vacuum. The artificial gravity generators kick in with a nauseating lurch. Through the main viewscreen, the curve of the Earth is visible. But it is not the peaceful blue marble. The Hunter fleet has arrived. Hundreds of needle-ships swarm the upper atmosphere like locusts. Green beams of high-energy plasma lance down from the Mothership, striking the surface.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches the destruction of the Valley.
- **Detailed Description:** One of the beams hits the coordinates of the launch site. The valley—the river, the forest, the grave where Torin lies—is engulfed in a blinding flash of light. When the light fades, there is nothing left but a crater of molten glass. The heat signature washes out the sensors. The home she spent twenty years building is erased from history.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a phantom pain in her chest, sharp and cold. It is as if a part of her soul was left down there to burn. She feels the urge to scream, to fire back, to do something violent. But she forces herself to remain still. She is the Captain now. She cannot afford the luxury of grief.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She watches the destruction of everything she loves without looking away. She memorizes the sight, turning her pain into cold, hard resolve.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They're burning it. They're scrubbing the timeline."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let them burn the dirt. We have the seed."

### Scene 3: The Zero-G (The Breakdown)

- **Key Event:** Angelica retreats to her ready room as the ship aligns for the time jump.
- **Detailed Description:** The ready room is small, sparse, and silent. Angelica floats in the center of the room, unstrapped from her chair. In the absence of gravity, her tears do not fall; they pool in her eyes, blurring her vision. She curls into a fetal position, hovering in the air. The photo of Torin she kept in her pocket floats beside her. She reaches out and grabs it, clutching it to her chest.
- **Internal Conflict:** The wall she built around her emotions crumbles. The grief hits her like a physical blow. She sobs, her body shaking. She mourns not just Torin, but the woman she was with him. The "Angelica" who planted gardens and learned to weave is dead, burned with the valley. Only the "Commander" remains. She hates the Commander.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She allows herself a moment of pure, undiluted weakness. She acknowledges that the price of saving the future was her own happiness.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't save you. I couldn't save anything."

- **Key Event:** Angelica recomposes herself.
- **Detailed Description:** The breakdown lasts exactly five minutes. Then, the ship's intercom chimes. "Captain, trajectory calculated." Angelica wipes her face. She uses a suction tube to clear the tears from the air. She straightens her uniform. She looks in the mirror. Her eyes are red, but her jaw is set. She opens the door and floats back out to the bridge.

### Scene 4: The Jump (The Vow)

- **Key Event:** Angelica takes the helm.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica straps back into the pilot's chair. Her hands fly over the controls, inputting the complex variables for the Star-Tear Drive. The drive requires a precise resonance frequency to tear a hole in the spacetime continuum without destroying the ship. She feels the familiar hum of the drive syncing with her own bio-rhythms. The ship is an extension of her will.
- **Internal Conflict:** She looks at the viewscreen one last time. The burning Earth reflects in her eyes. She feels a cold hatred for the Hunters. They took her past. She will take their future. She converts her grief into a weapon.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She transforms from a grieving widow into an avenging angel. She makes a silent vow to the universe that the Hunters will pay for every tree, every stone, and every life they burned.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Computer, lock coordinates. Target: The Zenith. Time: Twenty years ago."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I will make it count. I promise you, Torin. I will make it count. Engage."

- **Key Event:** The _Aeterna_ enters the Time Stream.
- **Detailed Description:** The stars outside stretch into lines of infinite light. The ship shudders violently as it punches through the membrane of reality. The bridge is bathed in a swirling vortex of blue and violet energy. The sound of the engines fades, replaced by the whispering roar of the time stream—the sound of a billion voices speaking at once. The _Aeterna_ vanishes from the prehistoric sky, leaving only a ripple in the fabric of space.
