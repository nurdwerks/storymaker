## Chapter 7: The Status

### Scene 1: The Respect / The Clearing

- **Key Event:** The duel is over. Ragnar is wiping blood from his nose.
- **Key Event:** He looks at the twisted cage door. At the mammoth rib lying in the dirt.
- **Key Event:** All signs of his defeat.
- **Key Event:** He walks over to the cage. He grabs the remaining ribs.
- **Key Event:** _Crack._ He tears them down.
- **Key Event:** "No cage," he grunts.
- **Key Event:** He turns to the tribe. "She is not meat. She is Warrior."
- **Key Event:** The tribe mutters. Warrior? She is small. Soft.
- **Key Event:** "Strength is not just muscle," Ragnar says, tapping his temple. "She hunts with this. She hunted me. And she caught me."
- **Key Event:** He looks at Angelica. "You are free to walk. But silence is best. Some still see a demon."

### Scene 2: The Freedom / The Camp

- **Key Event:** Angelica walks through the camp. Her legs are shaky, but she keeps her head high.
- **Key Event:** She observes everything.
- **Key Event:** **Water Filtration:** They use layers of charcoal and sand in hollow logs to filter river water.
- **Key Event:** "Carbon filtration," she notes. "That's advanced."
- **Key Event:** **Leather Curing:** Women chew the hides to soften them, using enzymes in saliva. Gross, but effective chemical processing.
- **Key Event:** **Aerodynamics:** The spears are fletched with specific feathers, spiraled to induce spin stability.
- **Key Event:** "Rifling," she realizes. "They discovered rifling before the wheel."
- **Key Event:** She stops feeling superior. These people aren't stupid. They are survivors. They are engineers of the wild.

### Scene 3: The Miracle / The Fire Pit

- **Key Event:** A scream cuts through the air.
- **Key Event:** A mother is holding a young boy. He is turning blue. Clucking.
- **Key Event:** "The Spirit!" she wails. "The Breath-Thief has him!"
- **Key Event:** The Shaman (Torin) shakes a rattle over the boy. Trying to scare the spirit away.
- **Key Event:** The boy's eyes are bulging.
- **Key Event:** Angelica pushes through the crowd.
- **Key Event:** "Move!" she shouts.
- **Key Event:** She grabs the boy. She spins him around.
- **Key Event:** She finds the xyphoid process. She makes a fist.
- **Key Event:** _Thrust. Thrust._
- **Key Event:** Up and in.
- **Key Event:** _Pop._
- **Key Event:** A hard nut flies out of the boy's mouth.
- **Key Event:** He sucks in a huge breath. Then he starts crying.
- **Key Event:** The mother grabs him. "He breathes! The demon gave him breath!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica wipes her hands. "Physics gave him breath. The nut was blocking the trachea. I just applied pressure."

### Scene 4: The Title / Torin's Hut

- **Key Event:** Later, Torin finds her.
- **Key Event:** He hands her a necklace of polished river stones. A badge of office.
- **Key Event:** "You fought the Breath-Thief," he says. "And you won."
- **Key Event:** "It wasn't a thief, Torin. It was a walnut."
- **Key Event:** "To the mother, it was death," Torin says. "To you, it was a puzzle."
- **Key Event:** He places the necklace over her head.
- **Key Event:** "Wise Woman," he names her.
- **Key Event:** Angelica touches the stones. They are heavy.
- **Key Event:** "I'm an engineer, Torin. Not a witch."
- **Key Event:** "Here, they are the same," he says. "The title protects you. A Warrior can be challenged. A Wise Woman is sacred."
- **Key Event:** Angelica thinks about it. Sacred implies safety. Safe means she can work. She can plan.
- **Key Event:** "Fine," she says. "I'll take the title. But I'm not doing rain dances. And if anyone asks, it's just air pressure. Physics. Biology."
- **Key Event:** Torin smiles. "Call it what you want, Angelica. As long as the boy breathes."
- **Key Event:** "Just... don't start worshipping me," she adds. "I'm not a goddess. I'm just an engineer who knows how to fix a clogged pipe."
