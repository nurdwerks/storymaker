## Chapter 35: The Interface

### Scene 1: The Core Room

- **Key Event:** Angelica enters the ship's Interface Core—the room where Vane used to commune with the ship.
- **Key Event:** It is a throne of cables and needles. It looks like a torture device.

### Scene 2: The Preparation

- **Key Event:** Kaelen and Ria follow her. They beg her not to do it. The Interface burns out the mind of anyone who isn't augmented (like Vane was).
- **Key Event:** Angelica hands Kaelen her "Copper Token" (the luck charm Vane gave her in Book 1).
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Hold this for me. If I'm not back in an hour, melt it down."

### Scene 3: The Sit Down

- **Key Event:** She sits in the chair. The needles seek the ports in her spine (which she had installed in Book 5).
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica** — She doesn't flinch as the metal pierces her nervous system.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Connection established. Initiate protocol: Diplomatic Immunity."
