## Chapter 08: The First Shot

### Scene 1: Vane's Command Spire

- **Key Event:** Vane, growing impatient with the Sphere's silence, decides to demonstrate strength. He overrides Ria's lockout and seizes control of the Forward Railgun Battery.
- **Key Event:** He targets the Sphere.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "If they will not speak, they will bleed."

### Scene 2: The Hull Surface / Turrets

- **Key Event:** The massive railguns fire. A kinetic slug the size of a bus is accelerated to a fraction of light speed.
- **Key Event:** The slug impacts the Sphere. There is no explosion. No debris. The slug simply passes _into_ the Sphere and vanishes. The Sphere ripples slightly, like water.

### Scene 3: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** The crew watches in horror. The kinetic energy wasn't deflected; it was deleted.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen** — He understands the scale of the power gap.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "It didn't block it. It... turned it off."
