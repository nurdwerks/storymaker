## Chapter 36: The Door

### Scene 1: The Move

- **Key Event:** Torin forcibly removes Angelica from the Time Engine's core chamber.
- **Detailed Description:** The core chamber is destabilizing. The temporal dampeners have failed, and arcs of temporal lightning—purple and white energy that erases matter from existence—are striking the floor plates. The sound is a high-pitched scream of tearing reality. Torin, the Architect, stands at the central console. He knows the variables. He knows that Angelica will never leave him willingly. He feigns a moment of weakness, stumbling. When she steps forward to support him, offering her shoulder, he grabs her by the harness of her suit. With a surge of desperate strength amplified by his exo-frame, he shoves her backward through the open airlock door. The movement is violent, born of necessity. Angelica stumbles back, tripping over the raised threshold, landing hard on the grating of the bridge corridor. Her breath leaves her in a rush.
- **Internal Conflict:** Torin hates himself for being rough with her. He sees the shock in her eyes as she falls. He wants to apologize, to explain, but he knows that a gentle goodbye would turn into a debate, and a debate would kill them both. He hits the "Seal" button on the interior panel before she can scramble to her feet. He chooses her survival over her forgiveness.

### Scene 2: The Glass

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes she is locked out.
- **Detailed Description:** The heavy blast door slams shut with a hydraulic hiss, engaging the magnetic locks with a definitive *thunk*. Angelica throws herself at the door. She pounds on the thick, reinforced porthole glass with her fists until her knuckles bruise. She screams his name, but the sound is cut off by the vacuum seal. Inside the chamber, the light is shifting from white to a deep, bruising purple as time begins to fold in on itself. Torin stands on the other side, bathed in the red glow of the emergency lights. He looks small against the backdrop of the spinning machine, a lone figure facing the end of time.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a primal panic. It is the panic of abandonment, of being the one left behind to live. She claws at the control panel, trying to override the lock, but the panel sparks. Torin has fused the mechanism from the inside. She is trapped in safety. She realizes he planned this.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She stops screaming. She presses her forehead against the cold glass, feeling the vibration of the engine. She realizes this is his choice. It is a calculated sacrifice, the only variable that solves the equation. She respects him enough to stop fighting, even though it breaks her heart.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Don't you dare! Torin! Open this door! We can find another way! The math can change!"

### Scene 3: The Goodbye

- **Key Event:** Torin's final message.
- **Detailed Description:** The roar of the Time Engine is now so loud it vibrates the floor plates under Angelica's feet. Inside the chamber, gravity is failing. Debris floats in the air. Torin floats slightly off the floor, anchored by his boots. He walks—or drifts—back to the console. He doesn't look at the explosion building behind him. He looks only at Angelica. He places his hand on the glass, matching hers. His lips move.
- **Internal Conflict:** Torin feels the dissolution of his own timeline. His memories are starting to fade, replaced by the white noise of the paradox. He forgets his childhood. He forgets his name. But he holds onto one image: her face. He mouths the words, knowing the comms are down. He pours all his remaining self into that silent message.

- **Key Event:** Torin activates the overload.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns away. He grips the lever with both hands. The metal is hot enough to burn through his gloves. He pulls it down. The machine shrieks. A wave of temporal distortion washes over him. For a second, he sees all possible futures—and in all of them, Angelica lives. That is enough. He vanishes in a flash of light that leaves a silhouette burned onto the chaos. The chamber is consumed by white.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Torin** — He dies as he lived: solving the problem. He accepts erasure to ensure continuity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin (Mouthed):** "I love you. Now go. Fly. Save them."

### Scene 4: The Run

- **Key Event:** Angelica runs to the escape pod.
- **Detailed Description:** The blast door begins to buckle. The heat is radiating through the metal. Angelica turns and runs. She sprints down the corridor, tears streaming down her face, blinding her. She doesn't look back. She runs for the pod, carrying his sacrifice with her.
- **Internal Conflict:** She feels a deep, cold hollow in her chest. She is alive, but she feels like she died in that room. She promises herself she will make it worth it.
