## Chapter 16: The Selection Begins

### Scene 1: The Drop

- **Key Event:** The staging area.
- **Detailed Description:** The cargo bay of the airship _Verdict_ is cold and vibrates with the roar of engines. Fifty candidates stand in formation. They wear matching tactical grey jumpsuits made of thin, cheap ballistic weave. They are shivering. The bay doors are closed, but the wind whistles through the seals. Headmaster Vane walks the line. He does not look at them; he looks through them. He checks his pocket watch.

- **Key Event:** The rules.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane stops in the center of the bay. His voice is amplified by the comm-beads in their ears. "Below you lies the Arena. A Clockwork Metropolis designed to test your adaptability. The rules are simple. In the center of the crater stands the Spire. The first three squads to reach the Zenith of the Spire qualify for the Iron Selection. There are no other rules."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "The rest will be recycled. Efficiency demands that we do not waste resources on failures."

- **Key Event:** The floor drops.
- **Detailed Description:** There is no countdown. Vane presses a button on his watch. The floor of the cargo bay retracts instantly. Fifty bodies drop into the void. The sound of fifty people screaming is snatched away by the wind. They fall through the cloud layer, tumbling uncontrollably.

- **Key Event:** The landing.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica plummets. She spreads her limbs to increase drag, trying to stabilize. Below, the clouds part. She sees the Arena. It is a city the size of Manhattan, but built entirely of brass, copper, and grinding iron gears. It is not static. The buildings are moving. Streets shift and realign. Smoke stacks vent rhythmic puffs of steam. She aims for a sector of industrial roofing. She hits a metal grate, rolling to absorb the impact. The metal is hot. The impact jars her teeth, but she is alive.

### Scene 2: The Landscape

- **Key Event:** Regrouping.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica scrambles to her feet. The noise of the city is deafening—a constant mechanical grinding. She taps her comm-bead. "Squad Iron, report." Static. Then, Kaelen's voice. "Visual confirmed. Firing flare." A bolt of black shadow shoots up from a water tower three blocks east. It explodes into a cloud of darkness against the grey sky.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Landed in Sector 7. Grid coordinates unstable. Moving to flare."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I landed... inside a clock tower? I think I'm on a giant minute hand. It's moving. I'm getting dizzy."

- **Key Event:** Meeting point.
- **Detailed Description:** They converge on the water tower. Kaelen is already there, surveying the terrain. Ria climbs up the side, denting the metal with her boots. They look out over the city. It is a maze of moving parts. Entire city blocks are sliding on rails. Bridges extend and retract.

- **Key Event:** The pattern analysis.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica pulls out her datapad. She starts tracking the movements. She sees a pattern. It's not random. "It's an encryption algorithm," she mutters. "Base-12. Fibonacci spirals. The city reconfigures every hour on the hour."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's not a walk. It's a puzzle. If we take the straight path, the road will crushing us. We have to move with the gears."

### Scene 3: The First Blood

- **Key Event:** Observing the competition.
- **Detailed Description:** From their vantage point, they see movement below. Squad Bronze—three heavy-hitters from the Upper Ward—are chasing a lone girl from Squad Glass. The girl is fast, vaulting over steam pipes, but she is cornered at an intersection. She hesitates.

- **Key Event:** The environmental kill.
- **Detailed Description:** A massive bell tolls across the city. ONE O'CLOCK. The city shifts. The two city blocks flanking the intersection slide together with the force of continental plates. The girl from Squad Glass dives through a narrowing gap and rolls to safety. Squad Bronze is too slow. They try to hold the walls apart with brute strength. It is futile. The walls slam shut. There is a wet, popping sound, followed by silence. Liquid red splashes out from the seam where the buildings met.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen's reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica covers her mouth. Ria looks away. Kaelen watches until the walls separate again, revealing the crushed remains. He does not blink.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — His reaction defines his philosophy. He sees the death as a validation of natural selection.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Efficiency. The weak are filtered out by the environment. Squad Bronze failed the dexterity check."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Dexterity check? They were squashed! Vane didn't just build an obstacle course. He built a meat grinder."

### Scene 4: The Strategy

- **Key Event:** Assigning roles.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen turns to the squad. He draws a map in the dust on the water tower roof.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Assignment. Ward, you are Navigator. You predict the shifts. If you get the math wrong, we end up like Squad Bronze."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No pressure."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Ria, you are Point. Your Steel-Hide can withstand impact and steam vents. You clear the path."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I punch the buildings. Got it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I am Rear Guard. I remove the other players."

- **Key Event:** The implication of "remove."
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at Kaelen. "Remove?" Kaelen stares back, his eyes cold. "There are three slots. There are fifty candidates. Subtraction is inevitable."

- **Key Event:** Moving out.
- **Detailed Description:** The bell tolls the quarter hour. The Spire in the center of the city glows. It is miles away, across a sea of grinding metal. They drop down from the tower and begin the run.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Welcome to the machine. Try not to become a spare part."
