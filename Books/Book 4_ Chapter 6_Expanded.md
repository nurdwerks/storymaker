### Chapter 10: The Drifter

#### Scene 1: The Ambush

The group moved through the steam tunnels, seeking a path to the lower levels where the geothermal vents might offer more heat. The air was thick with humidity, making it hard to breathe. The walls were slick with algae and condensation, dripping a steady rhythm that sounded like a countdown.

They were tired. They were sloppy. They stumbled over pipes and splashed through puddles, making too much noise. Their discipline had eroded with their calorie count. Every step was a battle against exhaustion, against the urge to just lie down and sleep.

They walked right into a nest.

It was a boiler room, warm and humid. And it was carpeted in them. Dozens of Blighted lay in heaps, sleeping in the warmth. They looked like piles of rags until they started to move. The smell was overpowering—rotting meat and sulfur, the scent of a charnel house.

Angelica stepped on a loose grate. *Clang.*

Every head snapped up at once. Fifty pairs of black void-eyes opened. They glowed with a malevolent hunger. The silence broke as fifty throats hissed in unison.

"Run!" Angelica screamed, turning back the way they came.

They tried to retreat, but the door behind them slammed shut—rusted gears failing at the worst moment. They were trapped. The trap had sprung, and they were the rats.

"I'm out of ammo," Ria shouted, clicking her empty shotgun. She reversed it, holding it like a club. "Get behind me! I'll break their skulls!" She stood like a titan of rust, defiant to the end.

"My arm is dead," Zephyr yelled, frantically tapping his wrist. "No charge! I can't pay the toll! I'm useless!" He looked terrified, the bravado stripped away. He was just a man with a heavy, dead piece of metal attached to his shoulder, a golden anchor dragging him down.

The Blighted surged forward, a wave of teeth and claws. They scrambled over each other, a tsunami of hunger. They didn't make a sound, just a collective hiss of anticipation. They were fast, unnatural, and endless.

#### Scene 2: The Shot

They braced for death. Kaelen raised his sword, his hand trembling. Angelica pulled her knife. It felt small and pathetic against the horde. This was it. The end of the line. They were going to die in a basement, eaten by monsters.

*ZAP.*

A beam of blue plasma cut through the dark. It was blindingly bright, hotter than the sun. It hit the lead Blighted in the chest, vaporizing it instantly. The smell of ozone and burnt meat filled the air, replacing the stench of rot.

*ZAP. ZAP.*

Two more shots. Precise. Rhythmic. Two more monsters fell, holes punched through their chests, cauterized instantly. The shots were coming from above, from the darkness of the catwalks.

The Blighted hesitated, confused by the light. They hissed, shielding their eyes, their momentum broken.

#### Scene 3: The Savior

A figure stepped out from the steam pipes on the catwalk above. He moved with a heavy, deliberate grace.

He looked like a ghost from another era. He wore a tattered trench coat that had once been beige but was now stained the color of the Undercity. A wide-brimmed fedora shadowed his face. He held a custom plasma-rifle with the ease of a man who had been holding a gun since he was born. The weapon hummed with power, the only clean thing on him.

It was **Hatcher**. The Drifter. The legend of the Undercity. The man who had walked away from the Zenith and survived the fall.

He looked sixty, with a face like a dried riverbed, lined with deep crevices of grief and hard living. But he moved with the fluid grace of a man half his age. His eyes were hard, flinty, seeing everything and feeling nothing. He chewed on an unlit matchstick, rolling it from one side of his mouth to the other.

"Clear the lane!" he barked, his voice gravel and smoke. It was a command, not a request.

He pulled a pin on a grenade and dropped it over the railing. It wasn't explosive. It was a **Cryo-Grenade**.

It detonated with a *woosh*, flash-freezing the floor. The Blighted slipped, crashing into each other, their limbs freezing and snapping like dry twigs. They howled in confusion as the ice encased them, turning the floor into a skating rink of death.

#### Scene 4: The Greeting

Hatcher slid down a ladder, landing between the group and the monsters. He fired three more shots, finishing off the ones that were still moving. He moved with brutal efficiency, wasting no movement. He was a machine of war, precise and deadly.

He spat on the frozen ground. He reached into his coat and pulled out a dented flask engraved with initials that were worn smooth.

"You kids are loud," he grumbled, taking a swig. The smell of cheap algae-whisky wafted from him. "I heard you three sectors away. You sound like a herd of elephants in a library."

Angelica stared at him, her heart still racing. "Who are you?"

Hatcher wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Someone who was enjoying the quiet until you showed up."

He reloaded his rifle, the mechanism clicking smoothly. He looked at the frozen carnage, then at the terrified group. He shook his head, his expression one of weary resignation.

"I was hoping to die alone," Hatcher said, sighing the sigh of a man who has seen too much. "You ruined my retirement. Now I have to babysit."

He jerked his head towards a hidden door behind a pile of pipes. "Move. Before they thaw out. And try to be quiet this time. I'm out of grenades, and I don't work for free. My hourly rate is silence, and you're already in debt." The group scrambled after him, leaving the frozen monsters behind in the dark. Hatcher took one last look at the frozen nest, tipped his hat, and followed them into the shadows. He was back in the game, whether he liked it or not. The Drifter had a job to do, and he never left a job unfinished. He was the shepherd of the lost, and his flock was growing. He checked his ammo counter. Not enough. It was never enough. But it would have to do. The Stone Season had begun, and he was the only one who knew how to survive the winter.
