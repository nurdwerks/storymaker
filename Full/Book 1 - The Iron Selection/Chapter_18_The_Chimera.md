# Chapter 18: The Chimera

The transition from the roar of the Foundry to the silence of Sector 12 was jarring. One moment, the air was vibrating with the sound of pistons the size of skyscrapers; the next, they were wrapped in a suffocating blanket of white noise.

Sector 12. The Steam-Works.

"It feels like breathing soup," Ria grumbled, her voice muffled by the atmospheric density. She wiped a gloved hand across her faceplate, smearing the condensation that had already gathered there. "I prefer the fire. At least fire is honest. This... this is wet."

"It is geothermal exhaust," Kaelen corrected, his voice cutting through the fog with its usual sharp precision. "The planet's core vents here. The moisture is a byproduct of the cooling systems. Keep your seals tight. The vapor contains trace amounts of sulfuric acid."

"Lovely," Ria muttered. "Spicy air."

They walked along a narrow gantry suspended over an abyss of pipes. The metal grating beneath their boots was slick with oil and water. Below, in the infinite drop, orange lights flickered like dying stars—maintenance drones welding leaks in the deep infrastructure.

Angelica walked in the center of the formation. She was checking her datapad, but the screen was a mess of static.

"Magnetic interference is climbing," she noted, tapping the casing. "My compass is spinning. We're navigating by dead reckoning."

"We are navigating by flow," Kaelen said, not looking back. "The water transport lines are the largest. They will lead to the Core. Follow the current."

The path ahead narrowed. The gantry ended, replaced by a series of pressurized corridors.

"Hold," Kaelen raised a fist.

The corridor ahead was blocked. Not by a door, but by steam.

Massive pipes lined the walls, and they were leaking. Jets of white, superheated vapor shot out across the path in rhythmic bursts.

_HISS... PAUSE. HISS... PAUSE._

It was a gauntlet.

"Timed vents," Angelica analyzed. "It's a cooling cycle."

"Can we go around?" Ria asked, eyeing the jets. "That looks hot enough to peel paint."

"It is hot enough to strip flesh," Kaelen said. "And no. This is the only route to Line 4. We must cross."

He picked up a loose bolt from the floor and tossed it into the nearest jet.

_PING._

The bolt turned red instantly, then slagged.

"Okay," Ria swallowed. "So, don't touch the white fluffy stuff. Got it."

"The pattern is complex," Angelica stepped forward, her eyes narrowing. She activated her mechanic's focus. The world slowed down. She saw the pipes not for what they were, but for what they did. Variables. Pressure. Temperature. Release.

_Valve A opens at t-minus 0. Valve B opens at t-minus 2. Valve C is random... no, not random. Variable pressure._

"It's a base-3 sequence," she muttered. "Left, Right, Cross. Then a 4-second delay."

"Are you sure?" Kaelen asked.

"I'm looking at the pressure gauges," Angelica pointed to the rusted dials on the wall. "The needle wobbles before the release. We have a 4-second window to clear the first sector."

"Four seconds is tight," Ria rolled her shoulders, testing the servos in her suit. "I'm heavy. I don't sprint."

"Then you better start," Angelica said. "On my mark."

She watched the needle. It twitched.

_3... 2... 1..._

"GO!"

They ran.

Angelica led, ducking under a horizontal pipe. Kaelen was a blur beside her. Ria thundered behind, her boots clanging on the metal.

_HISS._

A jet of steam erupted right behind Ria's heel.

"Too close!" Ria yelled.

"Keep moving!" Angelica shouted. "Next interval is quicker! Two seconds!"

They reached the mid-point of the corridor. Here, the pipes were ruptured. The steam wasn't just venting; it was screaming.

"Stop!" Angelica skidded to a halt.

A wall of steam blocked the path. It was continuous.

"Variable change!" she panicked. "The pressure is holding! It's not cycling!"

"We're trapped," Ria looked back. The vents behind them were preparing to fire. "We can't go back!"

"The valve!" Kaelen pointed. Even his composure was cracking. "Manually override it!"

High on the wall, ten feet up, was a large iron wheel. It was rusted shut.

"I can't reach it!" Angelica yelled.

"Ria!" Kaelen barked.

Ria didn't ask questions. She grabbed Angelica by the waist and hoisted her into the air like a ragdoll.

"Do the thing, Runt!" Ria shouted.

Angelica frantically grabbed the wheel. The metal was scalding hot. Her gloves smoked.

"It's seized!" she gritted her teeth, pulling with everything she had.

"Turn it!" Kaelen yelled. "The cycle is resetting!"

Below, the vents hissed. A precursor to the blast.

Angelica screamed, putting her legs against the wall for leverage. She channeled every ounce of frustration, every ounce of fear.

_CREAAAAAAK._

The rust broke. The wheel turned.

_CLUNK._

The wall of steam in front of them cut off instantly.

"Drop!" Angelica yelled.

Ria dropped her. They dove forward, sliding on the wet floor, just as the vents behind them erupted in a cataclysm of pressure.

They slid into the next section, safe, gasping for air.

"That..." Ria wheezed, lying on her back. "Was exciting."

"That was inefficient," Kaelen stood up, brushing rust from his tunic. "But effective."

Angelica lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling. Her hands were shaking. Her gloves were ruined, the palms melted smooth.

"Base-3," she whispered. "The third variable was manual input. It was a test."

"A test of what?" Ria sat up. "Reflexes?"

"Trust," Kaelen looked at them both. "A team that cannot move together burns together."

He offered a hand to Angelica.

"Up, Ward. The Steam-Works have only just begun."

All around them, the silence returned. But it felt heavier now.

Line 4 led them deeper.

It was a labyrinth of oxidized copper pipes and dripping iron grating, suspended over an endless abyss of geothermal vents. The air was thick, wet, and smelled of sulfur and wet rust. Visibility was less than five meters. Everything beyond that was a shifting wall of white fog.

_Hiss... Clank. Hiss... Clank._

The rhythmic venting of pressure valves was the only sound. It was like walking inside the lungs of a dying giant.

"I can't see a thing," Ria whispered. Her voice sounded dampened, swallowed by the moisture. She swiped a hand across her faceplate, smearing the condensation. "My sensors are ghosting. Too much thermal interference."

"Stay close," Kaelen ordered. He was a shadow in the mist, his form blurred. "The steam hides us, but it hides them too."

Angelica checked her datapad. The screen was fogged, the holographic display flickering.

"Magnetic interference is high," she noted, tapping the casing. "My compass is spinning. We're navigating by dead reckoning."

"We are navigating by flow," Kaelen corrected. "Follow the pipes. The water transport lines are the largest. They will lead to the Core. Follow the current."

They moved in a tight formation. Kaelen took point, his dual monofilament blades drawn but held low. Ria took the rear, her massive bulk moving with surprising quiet on the wet grate. Angelica flourished in the center, her eyes scanning the pipes not for enemies, but for structural weaknesses.

The heat was sweltering. It wasn't the dry, searing heat of the Foundry. It was a wet, heavy heat that pressed against their skin and plastered their hair to their foreheads. It made it hard to breathe.

Angelica felt a drip of condensation run down her spine. Ideally, she would have adjusted her environmental suit, but the controls were jammed with grit.

_Variable: Fatigue,_ she thought. _Hydration levels dropping. Mental acuity at 88%._

"Do you hear that?" Ria stopped.

The squad froze.

_Hiss... Clank._

"Hear what?" Angelica whispered.

"The clicking," Ria said. "It stopped."

Kaelen turned slowly, scanning the ceiling. The Steam-Works was a threedimensional maze. Threats didn't just come from the front; they came from above and below.

"I hear nothing," Kaelen said.

"Exactly," Ria unslung her heavy repeater from her back. "The valves just cycled. But I didn't hear the solenoid click."

Angelica looked up. Above them, a dense cluster of cabling and smaller pipes disappeared into the fog.

"Pressure differential," she muttered. "If a valve doesn't cycle, it means there's a blockage. Or..."

_Displacement._

The steam above them swirled. It wasn't a natural drift. It was a wake.

"Above!" Kaelen shouted.

He didn't look; he moved. He shoved Angelica hard to the right.

_CRASH._

A heavy object impacted the grate where she had been standing a microsecond before. The metal floor plates bowed under the weight, groaning in protest.

Steam billowed out, displaced by the sudden arrival.

Angelica scrambled backward, slipping on the wet metal. She looked up.

It was beautiful. It was terrifying.

It was a Chimera.

A Class-4 Biological-Mechanical Hybrid. The Academy's apex predator.

It possessed the body of a lion, massive and muscular, but the biology had been perverted. Its fur was gone, replaced by seeking kinetic-mesh armor plates that shifted and rippled like liquid mercury. Its mane was a halo of twitching razor-wire coils. Where a tail should be, a hydraulic scorpion tail arched over its back, tipped with a dripping injector needle the size of a spear.

Its eyes were red optical sensors that cycled through the spectrum, locking onto them with a mechanical whir.

"Target acquired," the machine growled. The voice was synthesized, layered over the guttural roar of a beast. "Designation: Squad Iron."

"That's a big kitty," Ria said, her voice tight.

"It is a Chimera," Kaelen said, stepping between the beast and Angelica. "Do not engage in melee. Its armor disperses kinetic impact."

"Run?" Ria asked, raising her gun.

"No," Kaelen's blades began to hum. "Disassemble."

The Chimera turned its head. The red eyes focused on Kaelen. It analyzed him. It dismissed him.

It looked at Ria.

"Threat assessment: Heavy," the machine announced.

Then it looked at Angelica.

"Threat assessment: Negligible. Priority: Cull the weak."

Angelica felt the cold knot of fear tighten in her stomach. The math was simple. In a confined space, against a Class-4 hunter, her survival probability was 12%.

_Variables,_ she forced herself to think. _Armor composition: Kinetic Mesh. Flammable? No. Conductive? Yes.\__

"It's insulated!" she yelled. "Electricity won't work on the mesh! Aim for the joints!"

The Chimera roared—a sound like grinding gears amplified through a PA system—and lunged.

It moved with impossible speed for something that weighed half a ton. It was a blur of silver and grey.

Kaelen met it. He was fast, faster than any human should be. He deflected a paw swipe that would have taken his head off, his blades sparking against the kinetic mesh.

"Displace!" Kaelen ordered, sliding under the beast's guard. He slashed at the underbelly.

_CLANG._

The mesh rippled, hardening at the point of impact. The blades bounced off.

"Adaptive armor!" Kaelen shouted, rolling away as the scorpion tail stabbed the metal where his chest had been. "It hardens in response to kinetic stress! I cannot cut it!"

"Don't hit it hard!" Angelica scrambled back, her mind racing. "Hit it slow! It's non-Newtonian logic!"

"I cannot fight _slow_, Ward!" Kaelen parried another blow, the impact jarring his entire frame.

The Chimera was relentless. It used the environment. It lashed its tail, cutting a steam pipe. A jet of scalding vapor erupted, separating Kaelen from the squad.

"Kaelen!" Ria raised her gun, but she couldn't fire. The fog was too thick; she would hit him.

The beast cornered Kaelen against the railing. It didn't pounce. It stalked. The razor-wire mane flared, creating a shield of spinning blades.

"It knows," Angelica realized. "It knows he's the threat. It's isolating him."

Kaelen was backed against the abyss. The red eyes of the machine locked onto him.

"Observation," Kaelen said, his voice calm despite the danger. "Variable speed. The tail moves faster than the paws."

He feinted left. The tail struck—a blur of motion. Kaelen twisted in mid-air, a maneuver that defied gravity, spinning around the strike. He landed on the beast's back.

He drove his blades down, not into the armor, but into the _mane_.

_SCREECH._

The monofilament edge caught the razor-wire. Sparks showered the room. Kaelen pulled, trying to jam the mechanism.

The Chimera thrashed. It slammed its body into the wall.

_WHAM._

Kaelen gasped as the air left his lungs. He held on.

"Ria! Now!" he choked out. "Shoot the legs!"

Ria opened fire.

_THUD-THUD-THUD._

The high-caliber rounds hit the rear legs. But the Chimera was smart. It dropped its hips, shielding the joints with its armored flank. The bullets sparked harmlessly off the mesh.

"It's eating the rounds!" Ria yelled. "I can't penetrate!"

The Chimera threw Kaelen off. He hit a pipe hard, denting it. He slumped, dazed.

The beast turned. It ignored Kaelen. It ignored Angelica.

It looked at Ria.

"Threat assessment: Heavy," the machine announced. "Armor analysis: Standard Infantry. Penetration probability: 99%."

It lowered its head. The scorpion tail arched high, leaking venom.

"Analysis correct," Ria dropped her gun. It Clattered on the grate. "Standard armor won't cut it."

"Ria, don't!" Angelica yelled. "The structural stress..."

"Math is for later, Runt," Ria unclipped her helmet. She tossed it aside. Her face was bare, her eyes hard. "Right now, we need physics. Specifically, mass."

She squared her stance, planting her feet wide on the slippery grate. She took a breath that expanded her chest.

"TITAN!"

She screamed the word like a command to the universe.

And the universe answered.

"TITAN!"

The word wasn't just a shout; it was an activation code. A vocal key that unlocked the limiters in Ria's bio-rig.

The air around her warped. It was a visible distortion, like heat haze in a desert.

"Spectral overlay," Angelica noted, her mind retreating into the safety of observation. "She's calling the avatar."

A translucent blue-grey phantom manifested around Ria. It was massive—a twelve-foot-tall Silverback Gorilla made of hard light and Void-geometry. It overlapped her body, its huge spectral arms aligning with her own.

Inside the avatar, Ria changed.

The servos in her suit whined as they pushed past safety tolerances. Her skin took on the sheen of gunmetal grey as the "Titan-Skin" hardening protocol engaged. Her muscles expanded, the synthetic fibers in her flight suit tearing at the shoulders. She didn't just look stronger; she looked unbreakable.

The Chimera didn't care. It was a machine. It saw mass. It saw a target.

It hit her in mid-air.

_CRASH._

The collision shook the entire walkway. Dust rained down from the pipes above. The impact should have sent Ria flying into the abyss.

She didn't move an inch.

She caught the lion by its fore-legs. Her hands, amplified by the spectral gorilla fists, clamped onto the beast's kinetic mesh.

Sparks flew—a shower of white-hot magnesium—as metal ground against force-field.

"Sit," Ria snarled. "Down!"

She twisted her hips. The spectral avatar mimicked the motion. She slammed the half-ton Chimera into the floor grate.

_WHAM._

The metal shrieked. A section of the railing tore loose and fell into the fog.

The Chimera roared, thrashing. Its razor-wire mane lashed out, scoring deep grooves in Ria's spectral armor. The blue light flickered where the wire hit, but it held.

"Get the tail!" Kaelen shouted, recovering his balance. "It is the primary weapon!"

Ria didn't look. She felt the movement of the hydraulic scorpion tail arching over the beast's back.

She let go of one paw and grabbed the tail mid-strike.

The injector needle stopped inches from her faceplate. A drop of green venom—neuro-toxin—dripped onto her visor, sizzling as it ate into the glass.

"No poking!" Ria yelled.

She planted a boot on the Chimera's flank for leverage. She pulled.

The servos in her suit screamed. The spectral gorilla roared, its mouth opening in a silent scream of effort.

_SCREEEEEECH._

The sound of tearing metal was nauseating. It sounded like a bone breaking, but louder.

With a final, violent jerk, she ripped the hydraulic tail from its mounting on the Chimera's spine.

Black oil—hydraulic fluid—sprayed across the steam, hissing as it hit the hot pipes. The Chimera convulsed, its primary weapon gone.

Ria tossed the severed tail over the edge.

"Disarmed!" she shouted, breathless but triumphant. "Who's next?"

But the Chimera wasn't biological. It didn't feel pain. It felt data.

_Damage assessment: Critical. Weapon system lost. Recalculating._

The machine stopped thrashing. It went perfectly still.

"Ria, move!" Angelica screamed. "It's not dead! It's re-routing!"

The Chimera moved. It didn't try to stand. It rolled.

It used its superior mass to twist inside Ria's grip. It wasn't trying to escape; it was trying to close the distance.

It slammed its shoulder into Ria's chest.

The impact was like a battering ram. Ria's spectral armor flared red—critical stress. She stumbled back.

The Chimera was on her instantly. It pinned her to the grate. Its weight was immense—dense alloy and heavy hydraulics.

The razor-wire mane flared out, wrapping around Ria's spectral arms, pinning them.

Then, the throat opened.

A rotary saw, mounted inside the lion's mouth, spun up. _VRRRRRRR._ It was a high-pitched whine that cut through the steam.

"No!" Kaelen launched himself at the beast's back. He stabbed his blades into the gaps in the armor, trying to find a purchase. But the kinetic mesh was too dense. His blades glanced off.

Angelica grabbed a loose section of piping. She swung it like a bat.

_CLANG._

It bounced harmlessly off the lion's armored flank.

The saw lowered. It touched the chest plate of Ria's spectral avatar.

_GRZRRRRRZT._

Sparks showered Ria's face. The blue light of the avatar screamed as it was ground away. The saw bit deeper. It was cutting through the hard-light. It was inches from her physical chest.

Ria was gritting her teeth, her neck veins bulging. She was pushing back, but the leverage was wrong. She was pinned.

"Boss..." she wheezed.

Angelica froze.

She saw the saw biting deeper. She saw the red light of the force-field failing. She saw the fear in Ria's eyes—not the thrill of the fight, but the cold, absolute certainty of death.

_Variable: Ria dies in 3 seconds._
_Variable: Kaelen cannot penetrate armor._
_Variable: I have no weapon._

The math resolved to zero.

Survival probability: 0.00%.

"No," Angelica whispered.

The world seemed to slow down. She saw the individual sparks flying from the saw. She saw a drop of sweat on Kaelen's forehead.

She looked at Aeon. The mechanical owl was perched on a high pipe, watching with impassive blue eyes.

He saw the math too.

"Reject the variable," Angelica said. Her voice was calm, detached. "Edit the data."

She reached out mentally. She didn't reach for a spell. She reached for the bird.

"Aeon," she commanded. "Eat it."

The bird tilted its head.

"Eat what?" the connection opened in her mind. It wasn't a voice; it was a concept.

"The mistake," Angelica said. "Eat the last ten seconds."

Aeon's eyes flashed white. A blinding, absolute white that erased the steam.

He opened his beak.

And the world broke.

The silence was the first thing.

It wasn't the absence of noise. It was the absence of _forward_.

The high-pitched whine of the saw stopped—not because it powered down, but because the sound waves were sucked back into the emitter.

The sparks that had been showering Ria's face froze in mid-air. They turned from orange to white, then retracted back into the metal of the saw blade.

The spray of hydraulic fluid that Ria had spilled lifted from the hot pipes. It reassembled into droplets, then streams, then a jet, flying backward into the severed stump of the Chimera's tail.

The severed tail itself, lying five meters away in the fog, jerked. It flew through the air, reattaching to the spine with a sickening _shloop_.

Ria un-screamed. Her contorted face relaxed, then smoothed. The blood on her cheek vanished.

The Chimera un-rolled. It flew backward, away from Ria, its mass defying gravity. It landed back on the ceiling cables, its claws gripping the metal.

The world blurred. It was like watching a video tape rewind at high speed, but visceral. The air pressure changed rapidly, popping Angelica's ears.

_Thump-thump-thump._

The feeling of her own heart beating backward was nauseating.

She felt a spike of agony drive itself into her frontal lobe. It wasn't a headache; it was a structural failure of her biology. Blood gushed from her nose, warm and metallic.

_Ten seconds._

That was the limit. The cost was exponential.

The white light faded.

The world snapped back into forward motion.

_Hiss... Clank._

The steam vented. The Chimera was on the ceiling. It hadn't jumped yet.

Angelica stood on the wet grate, blood pouring down her chin. She knew what was coming. She remembered the future.

"Target acquired," the machine growled. "Designation: Squad Iron."

Ria was looking at the beast. She was about to make a joke. She was about to get pinned.

"RIA!" Angelica screamed. The sound tore at her throat. "ROLL LEFT!"

The command cut through the noise of the steam. It was desperate. It was absolute.

Ria didn't hesitate. She didn't ask why. She didn't look. She trusted the command implicitly.

She dove to the left.

The Chimera lunged.

It landed on the empty grate where Ria had been standing a microsecond before. Its claws shredded the metal impacted with the force of a pile driver.

If Ria had been there, she would have been paste.

"Missed me!" Ria yelled, rolling to her feet. She looked confused. "Did we win? I swear it jumped me."

"It did," Angelica wheezed, wiping blood from her lip. "You just got a do-over."

The Chimera was confused. Its prey wasn't where the algorithm predicted. It paused, its logic core re-calculating the variable.

That pause was its mistake.

The missed pounce left its flank exposed and over-extended. Its armor plates were flared to vent heat from the jump.

Kaelen saw the opening.

He didn't stab; he sliced. He targetted the hydraulic lines governing the rear legs—the weakness Angelica had identified in the previous timeline but hadn't had time to communicate.

_SLASH._

Black fluid sprayed. The creature collapsed, hamstrung.

"Finish it!" Kaelen ordered.

Ria moved in, this time from the side. She raised her Titan-fists.

"Goodnight, kitty," she snarled.

She delivered a double-handed blow to the creature's cranial unit. The impact was thunderous. The metal skull crumpled. The logic core shattered.

The red eyes flickered. They cycled through the spectrum one last time—blue, green, yellow—before going dark.

The machine slumped.

Silence returned to the Steam-Works.

The squad stood over the smoking wreckage. The cooling metal ticked in the damp air.

Kaelen cleaned his blade with a precise, clinical motion. But he didn't sheath it. He looked at the dead machine. Then he looked at Angelica.

He saw the blood on her face. He saw the way she was leaning against the railing, trembling.

"Temporal manipulation," he said. His voice was quiet, dangerous. "That took energy. Significant energy."

"Did it?" Ria asked, kicking the dead lion. "Felt like a standard dodge to me."

"Impossible," Kaelen said. "The trajectory was unavoidable. You moved before the stimulus. You reacted to an event that had not occurred."

He stepped closer to Angelica.

"The cost?" he asked. "You are bleeding."

"Entropy demands a price," Angelica whispered. She wiped her nose again. The bleeding was slowing, but the headache remained—a dull throb behind her eyes. "I paid it."

She looked at Aeon. The bird preened its metal feathers, indifferent. It had eaten the time, digested the paradox, and was now waiting for the next meal.

"I didn't predict the future, Kaelen," she said, meeting his gaze. "I just remembered it."

Kaelen stared at her for a long moment. Then, slowly, he sheathed his blades.

"We have a schedule to keep," Kaelen repeated, turning toward the exit.

"Yeah, about that," Ria took a step. Her leg seized. The servo in her knee whined—a high, piercing shriek—and locked. Since her suit was essentially an exoskeleton, when it stopped, she stopped.

She tipped over, catching herself on the railing.

"Diagnostic," Kaelen barked.

"Titan strain," Ria grunted, hitting the release on her thigh plate. It didn't budge. "The actuators are fused. I burned out the cooling loop when I went big. I'm a statue, boss."

Kaelen looked at the path ahead. The steam was thickening.

"We cannot carry you," he said. It wasn't cruelty; it was physics. Ria in her armor weighed nearly three hundred pounds.

"Leave me," Ria said. She tried to sound casual, but her eyes were tight. "I'll reboot. Catch up in ten."

"A lie," Kaelen said. "If the actuators are fused, a reboot will not clear the physical blockage. You are immobile."

He looked at Angelica.

"Options?"

Angelica was already moving. She was kneeling by the dead Chimera. She wasn't looking at it with fear anymore; she was looking at it with greed.

"It's a Class-4," she muttered, pulling a multitool from her belt. "High-end hydraulics. Poly-fluid cooling."

She looked back at Ria.

"Your suit uses standard Academy hydraulics, right? Series-9?"

"Series-8," Ria corrected. "Vintage."

"Close enough," Angelica jammed her pry-bar into the Chimera's exposed flank. "The Chimera uses a variable-pressure system for its tail. If I can salvage the pump and the primary lines... I can bypass your blown loop."

"You want to plug _that_ thing into me?" Ria looked at the dead, oil-leaking monster.

"It's either that or you stay here and rust," Angelica snapped. There was a weird energy in her now—the mania of a scavenger who just found a gold mine.

_CRACK._

She leveraged a plate of armor off the lion's side. Underneath, the machinery was dense and wet with oil.

"Hold the light," she ordered Kaelen.

Kaelen didn't argue. He activated a lumen-strip on his wrist and aimed it.

For the next twenty minutes, the Steam-Works wasn't a battlefield; it was a workshop.

Angelica worked with a speed that frightened Ria. She ripped the hydraulic pump—a fist-sized sphere of black chrome—from the beast's spine. She severed the lines with Kaelen's knife, cauterizing the ends with a flare-match to stop the leaking.

"Turn around," Angelica told Ria. "I need access to your lumbar port."

Ria gripped the railing. "Be gentle. It's my first transplant."

Angelica opened the maintenance hatch on Ria's back. Smoke drifted out—the acrid smell of burnt wiring.

"You cooked the motherboard too," Angelica noted. "Titan-form pulls too much voltage."

"It gets the job done," Ria grunted.

"It's inefficient," Angelica stripped the wires. She jammed the Chimera's pump into the cavity. It was too big. She forced it. Metal groaned.

"This is going to hurt," she warned.

"Hurt me," Ria said.

Angelica connected the lines.

_HISS._

The Chimera's black fluid cycled into Ria's suit.

Ria gasped, arching her back.

"Cold," she hissed. "It feels... oily. It feels like it's alive."

"It's just fluid," Angelica said, her hands flying over the connections. "Cycling pressure. 40%... 80%..."

The servos in Ria's legs twitched. They unlocked.

"We have green lights," Angelica closed the hatch. She slumped back, wiping oil and blood from her face. "You're mobile. But don't go Titan again. The Chimera pump pushes higher pressure. If you red-line it, you'll blow your seals."

Ria stood up. She bounced on her heels. The sound of her suit was different now—deeper, throattier. Like a purring cat.

"Thanks, Wiring-Rat," Ria said. She looked at the dead Chimera, then at Angelica.

"Hey," she said softly.

"Yeah?" Angelica was cleaning her tool.

"Before," Ria said. "When you did the... the rewind thing."

Angelica froze. "What about it?"

"I felt it," Ria said. Her voice was very quiet. "I felt the saw."

Kaelen looked up sharply.

"Clarify," he ordered.

Ria rubbed her chest. There was no mark there, but she touched it like a bruise.

"It got me," she whispered. "In the other... time. Whatever. The saw hit me. I felt it cut the armor. I felt the cold. I felt..."

She stopped. She looked at Angelica with wide, terrified eyes.

"I died, didn't I?"

The silence stretched. The steam hissed around them.

Angelica looked at her hands. They were stained with black oil and red blood.

"Yes," she said.

Ria swallowed. She nodded slowly.

"Okay," she said. "Okay."

She didn't thank her. You don't thank someone for un-killing you. It's too big un-killing.

"Let's move," Kaelen said. His voice was harsh, breaking the mood. "The timeline is corrected. The memory is a phantom. Do not dwell on ghosts, Cadet. Focus on the mission."

He walked past Angelica. As he passed, he leaned in.

"You are dangerous," he whispered. "To them. And to us."

"I saved her," Angelica whispered back.

"You broke reality to do it," Kaelen said. "Next time, ask the cost before you pay it."

He moved into the fog.

Ria followed, her new hydraulics purring.

Angelica stood alone for a second. She looked at the Chimera. It was a hollow shell now, harvested and discarded.

_Eat or be eaten,_ she thought. _Scavenge or rust._

She turned and followed her squad.

Reference Log: Academy Monitor Station 4
Subject: Dr. Aris, Chief Artificer

The monitor room was cold, lit only by the blue glow of a thousand screens. Dr. Aris sat in his floating chair, his cybernetic eyes scanning the data streams from the Selection Arena.

He paused.

"Discontinuity," he murmured.

He rewound the feed from Sector 12.

Screen 445: Squad Iron vs. Chimera Unit 7.

Timestamp: 14:02:10. The squad is walking.
Timestamp: 14:02:22. The Chimera is dead.

"Gap," Aris tapped the console. "Where are the missing seconds?"

He ran a diagnostic. The biometric data from Subject Ward showed a massive spike in neural activity—levels consistent with a Psionic Overload—at exactly 14:02:15.

Simultaneously, the local entropic field in Sector 12 inverted. Heat flowed into cold. Decay reversed.

"Impossible," Aris whispered. He leaned forward, his mechanical iris zooming in on the pixelated image of the mechanical owl on the girl's shoulder.

"Chrono-kinetic manifestation," he breathed. "The Ward subject... she didn't just survive the trap. She edited the timeline."

He watched the feed again. He saw the seamless correction. The way the squad moved with impossible prescience.

It wasn't just luck. It was a rewrite.

"Prelate Vane must see this," Aris reached for the encrypted comms channel. Then he stopped.

He looked at the data again. It was beautiful. A violation of the laws of physics that suggested a power source beyond anything the House of Artificers had ever synthesized.

If Vane saw this, he would have the girl vivisected within the hour.

Aris deleted the alert.

He saved the file to his private, encrypted research archive. Folder: _Project Genesis._

"Let us see how far you can bend the rules, Miss Ward," Aris smiled, a thin, cruel expression. "Before they break you."

**High-Altitude Observation Deck: The Gilded Cage**

Lady Corinne reclined on a chaise lounge upholstered in white velvet. The air in the observation deck was perfumed with lavender and ozone, a stark contrast to the sulfurous reek of the arena below.

Before her, a massive holographic wall displayed fifty different feeds from the Selection.

"Boring," she sighed, swirling a glass of iridescent nectar. "Bronze is dying in a hole. Gold is... efficient, but dull. Where is my entertainment?"

"Squad Iron has entered Sector 12, My Lady," a servanta faceless drone in a porcelain maskmurmured, bowing low.

Corinne sat up straighter. "Ah. The Steam-Works. Nasty place. Rust does terrible things to one's complexion."

She swiped her hand, expanding the feed labeled **IRON**.

The image was grainy, obscured by the white fog of the cooling vents. She watched the encounter with the Chimera. She saw the ambush. She saw the boy, the Night scion, move with that terrifying, spiders-thread grace. She saw the brute, the girl they called "Titan," get pinned.

"Dead," Corinne noted, taking a sip. "Pity. I liked her spirit. But physics is physics."

She watched the saw lower. She watched the sparks fly.

"And... cut," Corinne whispered.

Then, the feed glitched.

It wasn't a static interference. It was a tear. For a fraction of a second, the image invertedcolors flipping, light bending in a way that made Corinne's eyes water.

When the image stabilized, the brute wasn't dead. She was rolling left. The Chimera was landing on empty air.

Corinne froze. The glass stopped halfway to her mouth.

"Rewind that," she commanded.

The servant tapped a console. "I cannot, My Lady. The feed is live. The buffer is... corrupted."

"Corrupted," Corinne repeated. She watched the rest of the fight. The boy hamstrung the beast. The brute crushed its skull.

It was a perfect victory. Too perfect.

Corinne zoomed in. She ignored the victors. She looked at the third member of the squad. The Runt. Angelica Ward.

The girl was leaning against the railing. Her face was pale. And she was bleeding. Not from a wound, but from her nose.

Corinne smiled. It was not a nice smile. It was the smile of a shark sensing blood in the water.

"Did you see that, Julian?" she asked the empty air, knowing her brother was likely listening on a separate channel. "Did you see the stitch?"

"I saw a glitch," Julian's voice floated from a speaker in the wall. He sounded bored, but Corinne knew him better. He was intrigued. "Sensors malfunction in the steam."

"Sensors do not bleed," Corinne tapped the image of Angelica's face. "That is a Psionic backlash. The girl didn't just dodge. She *paid*."

She stood up, walking to the edge of the deck. Below, the clouds swirled, hiding the city of gears and death.

"She is a variable," Corinne whispered. "A wildcard. Vane thinks she is just a battery. He is wrong."

"And what do you think she is?" Julian asked.

Corinne pressed her hand against the cold glass.

"I think she is a weapon," she said softly. "And I think I want to be the one to pull the trigger."

She turned back to the servant.

"Place a bet," she ordered.

"On Squad Gold, My Lady?"

"No," Corinne drained her glass. "Put everything on Iron. To survive the Sector. I want the odds."

"The odds are... unfavorable, My Lady. 12 to 1."

"Perfect," Corinne laughed. It was a bright, brittle sound. "I do love a long shot. Especially one that cheats."

She watched the feed one last time. Squad Iron was moving again, disappearing into the fog.

"Run little mice," she whispered. "The maze only gets harder from here."
