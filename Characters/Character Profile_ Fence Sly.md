# Character Profile: Fence "Sly"

**Archetype:** The Underworld Merchant / The Cheat
**True Sin:** GREED (He views every person as having a price and every story as having a profit margin).
**Virtue Mask:** HONESTY (He claims his cruelty is just "Being Real about Business").

## I. Role in the Story

"Sly" is a shady dealer who buys Zephyr’s stolen goods. He represents the parasitic nature of the Underworld's economy.

- **The Dehumanization:** He asks if Angelica is "for sale." When told no, he tells her to "move," because she's "blocking the light" on the merchandise.
- **The Ego:** He laughs at Zephyr’s jokes and calls him a "legend," helping to build a bubble of vanity around Zephyr that Angelica cannot penetrate.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Financial Betrayal / Exile. **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 6 ("The Backroom Deal"). Sly refuses to buy Zephyr's stolen goods, terrified of Vane's new "Protocol Silence." He exiles Zephyr from the Black Market to save his own skin.
  **Quote:** _"The Market is closed, Zephyr."_
- **Impact on Zephyr:** Zephyr is forced to distance himself from Sly to protect his own reputation. The loss of his most reliable fence cuts off Zephyr’s primary source of information and income, forcing him into riskier, more desperate jobs.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Market" is closed. The ring loses its ability to turn stolen Zenith goods into liquid credits, turning the Smuggler’s Ring into a group of "hoarders" who are trapped with valuable but unsellable contraband.
