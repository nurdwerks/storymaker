# Chapter 16: The Selection Begins

The air in the cargo bay of the airship _Verdict_ was not just cold; it was a physical assault. It stripped the heat from the skin, leaving fifty candidates shivering in their thin, grey jumpsuits. The bay was a cavern of riveted steel and hydraulic lines, vibrating with the subsonic roar of the anti-grav engines that kept the massive vessel hovering at twenty thousand feet.

Angelica stood in the third row, her arms wrapped around herself, trying to conserve body heat. The jumpsuit was standard-issue ballistic weave—tough enough to stop a knife, but useless against the biting wind that whistled through the seals of the bay doors.

She looked to her left. Ria was bouncing on the balls of her feet, her breath puffing out in white clouds. The giant girl looked nauseous.

"I hate flying," Ria muttered, her teeth chattering. "If engines stop, we fall. Physics. I hate physics."

"We're not flying," Angelica whispered back, her eyes fixed on the front of the bay. "We're hovering. It's different dynamics."

"Same result," Ria grunted. "Splat."

To her right, Kaelen Night stood perfectly still. He wasn't shivering. He looked like a statue carved from obsidian, his eyes closed, his breathing slow and rhythmic. He was conserving oxygen. He was preparing.

At the front of the bay, a platform lowered from the ceiling.

Headmaster Vane stood on it. He wore a heavy coat of fur and leather, a stark contrast to the freezing cadets. He held a pocket watch in his hand, checking it with the casual indifference of a man waiting for a train.

"Candidates," Vane's voice boomed, amplified by the comm-beads implanted in their ears. It wasn't a shout; it was a transmission. It lived inside their heads.

The chatter in the bay died instantly.

"Below you lies the Arena," Vane continued, not looking up from his watch. "A Clockwork Metropolis designed to test your adaptability. The rules are simple. In the center of the crater stands the Spire. The first three squads to reach the Zenith of the Spire qualify for the Iron Selection."

He looked up. His eyes were pale, watery, and utterly devoid of empathy.

"There are no other rules."

A murmur rippled through the ranks. No rules? That meant… anything.

"The rest," Vane added, snapping his watch closed with a distinct _click_, "will be recycled. Efficiency demands that we do not waste resources on failures."

"Recycled?" a boy from Squad Bronze shouted. "You mean disqualified, right?"

Vane didn't answer. He smiled. It was a thin, stretching of lips that didn't reach his eyes.

He pressed a button on the side of his watch.

There was no countdown. There was no warning klaxon.

The floor simply vanished.

The cargo bay doors, magnetic locks disengaging in a split second, retracted into the walls.

Fifty bodies dropped into the void.

The sound of fifty people screaming was snatched away instantly by the wind.

Angelica didn't scream. She gasped as the gravity dropped out of her stomach, a visceral lurch that felt like her organs were trying to escape through her throat.

Then, there was only the wind.

It roared in her ears, a deafening white noise that drowned out thought. It was cold—absolute, biting cold that froze the sweat on her skin instantly. She tumbled, the world spinning in a chaotic blur of grey sky and white clouds.

For a second, panic clawed at her throat. It was a primal instinct, the lizard brain screaming that _falling equals death_.

_No,_ she forced the thought down. _Panic implies a loss of control. I still have variables._

She forced her eyes open. The wind stung them, making them water, blurring her vision into streaks of grey and white.

She saw Ria tumbling below her, flailing like a falling boulder. The giant girl was screaming—a long, continuous note of pure terror.

She saw Kaelen diving. He was a dark dart against the clouds, his body streamlined, his arms tucked at his sides. He wasn't fighting the fall; he was riding it.

Angelica tried to mimic him. She spread her arms and legs. She increased her surface area.

_Terminal velocity,_ she calculated, her brain latching onto the math as a lifeline. _Mass times gravity divided by drag coefficient._

If she stayed in a dive, she would hit the ground at 120 miles per hour. Death would be instantaneous. A red smear on the pavement.

If she spread out, she could slow it down. Maybe to 90.

_Still fatal. But survivable if I hit an angle._

She caught the air. The tumbling slowed. She stabilized into a spread-eagle dive. The wind pressed against her chest like a solid wall.

**"Falling is just flying with a destination,"** Leo had told her once.

She closed her eyes for a split second. A memory flashed—sharp and bright against the grey.

_Flashback: The Silt. Sector 4. The Ruined Crane._

Angelica was ten. Leo was eight. They were climbing the skeleton of an ancient construction crane that leaned precariously over the toxic sludge of the canal.

"Don't look down," Angelica warned, gripping the rusted rebar.

"I like looking down," Leo said, swinging his legs over the abyss. "It makes the world look like a map."

"It makes you dizzy," she corrected. "Maps are flat. The world has gravity."

"Gravity is just the earth hugging you," Leo laughed. He let go with one hand.

"Leo!"

He slipped.

For a second, he hung there, suspended over the black water. Angelica lunged, grabbing his wrist. The strain popped her shoulder. She hauled him up, gasping, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird.

"You idiot," she hissed, shaking him. "You could have died."

Leo just grinned. He looked at the water below.

"But I didn't," he said. "You caught me. You'll always catch me, Angel. That's the variable."

_End Flashback._

"I can't catch you now, Leo," she whispered, the wind tearing the words from her lips. "I can't even catch myself."

Below her, the cloud layer approached. It was a thick, bruising blanket of purple and grey smog. It looked less like weather and more like a physical barrier.

She hit it.

It wasn't like fog. It was wet, cold, and smelled of sulfur and ozone. The visibility dropped to zero. She was blind.

The air grew denser. Heavier. It pressed against her lungs.

For a terrifying ten seconds, there was nothing but grey. No up, no down. Just the sensation of falling into the throat of a monster.

Then, she burst through.

Angelica gasped.

The world opened up below her.

And it was terrifying.

Below her, stretching to the horizon, was the Arena.

It wasn't a ruin. It wasn't a wilderness.

It was a machine.

It was a city the size of Manhattan, but built entirely of brass, copper, and grinding iron gears. It was a Clockwork Metropolis. And it was alive.

She saw skyscrapers that were actually massive pistons, pumping up and down in a slow, rhythmic cadence. The sound of their movement was a deep, bass thrum that vibrated in her chest even from this height. _WHUM-CHUNK. WHUM-CHUNK._

She saw streets that were conveyor belts, shifting and realigning. They were made of metal plates, etched with grooves for traction, sliding past each other with the screech of metal on metal.

She saw bridges that extended and retracted like the tongues of metal lizards. Some were rigid trusses; others were flexible cables that whipped in the wind.

Steam vented from a thousand pipes, creating rhythmic white puffs that looked like the city was breathing. It wasn't clean steam; it was tinged yellow with sulfur and black with coal dust.

The scale was dizzying. It was a fractal of gears—gears the size of coins meshing with gears the size of city blocks.

_Target,_ she thought, scanning the ground. _Find a roof. Not the streets. The streets are moving._

She spotted a sector of industrial roofing—corrugated iron, rusted but solid. It was coming up fast.

_Impact in ten seconds._

She tucked her limbs in. She angled her body. She turned her fall into a controlled slide.

_Five seconds._

She saw the rivets on the metal. She saw the rust. She saw the heat shimmering off the surface.

_Three._

She flared her body at the last second, creating a parachute of drag.

_Impact._

She hit the metal grate.

It wasn't a clean landing. It was a collision.

She didn't try to stop; she rolled. She tucked her chin to her chest, letting the momentum carry her. Her shoulder slammed into the corrugation. Her hip clipped a bolt.

One roll. Two rolls. Three.

She slammed into a vent pipe.

_CLANG._

The impact jarred her teeth. Pain, bright and sharp, shot up her shoulder. The metal was hot—scorching hot—singing the fabric of her jumpsuit.

She lay there for a second, gasping for air, staring up at the grey sky she had just fallen from.

The city roared around her. It was a cacophony of industry. Hammers ringing. Steam hissing. Gears grinding. It sounded like a war zone inside a factory.

She was alive.

She tapped her comm-bead, her hands shaking.

"Squad Iron," she wheezed. "Report."

Static. A hiss of white noise. Then, a click.

Then, Kaelen's voice. Calm. Unshaken. As if he hadn't just fallen twenty thousand feet. As if he was sitting in his library.

"Visual confirmed. Firing flare."

A bolt of black shadow shot up from a water tower three blocks east. It didn't glow; it absorbed light. It was a Void-Flare, cutting a hole in the grey sky. It exploded into a cloud of darkness, lingering like a bruise.

"Angelica?" Ria's voice crackled. She sounded breathless, likely from fear. "I landed... inside a clock tower? I think I'm on a giant minute hand. It's moving. I'm getting dizzy."

"Landed in Sector 7," Angelica replied, forcing herself to sit up. Her shoulder throbbed, but it wasn't dislocated. She rotated her arm. Painful, but functional. "Grid coordinates unstable. Moving to flare."

She stood up.

The view from the roof was staggering.

The city was a maze of moving parts. The "building" she was standing on wasn't stationary; it was slowly rotating, grinding against its neighbor with a screech equal to a train wreck. Sparks showered down into the gap between the buildings, falling into a dark abyss of gears below.

To her left, a chimney stack vented a plume of green smoke. To her right, a billboard made of flipping metal tiles displayed a portrait of the Emperor, his eyes following her as the tiles rotated.

"It's not a walk," she whispered to herself, watching a bridge retract just as a bird tried to land on it. The bird fluttered away, confused. "It's a puzzle."

She started to run.

She leaped over a gap between roofs, landing on a copper dome that vibrated with the hum of a dynamo beneath. She felt the electricity buzzing in her boots. She slid down the curve, catching a rain gutter to swing onto a catwalk.

The heat was oppressive. The city ran on steam and friction. The air smelled of oil, hot metal, and the faint, sweet scent of ozone.

She reached the water tower. It was a rusted cylinder standing on four spindly legs, overlooking a junction of moving streets. The legs were jointed, like the legs of a spider. The tower itself seemed to be breathing, expanding and contracting slightly with the pressure of the water inside.

Kaelen was already there. He was kneeling on the edge, surveying the terrain with a pair of binoculars. He didn't look like a student. He looked like a gargoyle, perched and patient.

Ria clambered up the ladder a minute later. She looked battered. Her jumpsuit was torn at the knee, and she had a smear of grease across her face.

"I hate clocks," Ria announced, pulling herself over the railing. She dented the metal with her grip. "I almost got pinched by a gear the size of a tank."

"Status?" Kaelen asked, not looking away from his binoculars.

"Alive," Angelica said. "Bruised. Hungry."

"Standard operating procedure," Ria added.

Kaelen lowered the binoculars. He looked at them.

"We have visual on the Spire," he said, pointing.

Angelica looked.

Miles away, in the center of the mechanical chaos, stood the Zenith Spire. It was a needle of white chrome, untouched by the rust and grime of the city. It shot up into the clouds, a beacon of purity in the sea of industrial filth.

"It's far," Angelica noted.

"Ten miles," Kaelen estimated. "As the crow flies. But we are not crows."

He gestured to the city below.

"The terrain is hostile. I have observed the shifts. Entire city blocks are sliding on rails. The path changes."

Angelica pulled out her datapad. It was cracked, but functional. She tapped into the local frequency, trying to find a signal.

"It's not random," she muttered, watching the readouts. "See that? The pulses?"

She pointed to a rhythmic venting of steam from a factory district to the north.

"It's binary," she realized. "Steam off implies zero. Steam on implies one. The city is broadcasting its movements."

She watched for another minute. Her eyes darted back and forth, decoding the pattern.

"It's an encryption algorithm," she said, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. "Base-12. Fibonacci spirals. The city reconfigures every hour on the hour."

She looked at Kaelen.

"It's not a walk. It's a synchronization exercise. If we take the straight path, the road will crush us. We have to move with the gears. We have to predict where the street will be, not where it is."

Kaelen looked at her. A flicker of respect crossed his face.

"Navigator," he said. "That is your new designation."

"Better than 'Bait'," Angelica said.

"Debatable," Kaelen replied. "If you get the math wrong, we end up like Squad Bronze."

"Squad Bronze?" Ria asked. "Where are they?"

Kaelen pointed down.

Three blocks away, near a massive intersection of grinding gears, movement caught their eye.

Three figures in bronze-colored jumpsuits were chasing a lone girl in a glass-shimmering suit. Squad Bronze. Chasing Squad Glass.

"They are hunting," Kaelen noted.

"The objective is the Spire," Angelica said. "Why are they wasting energy?"

"Because they are idiots," Kaelen said. "Watch."

The chase entered a narrow alleyway between two massive factories. The girl from Squad Glass was fast—parkour fast. She vaulted over steam pipes and slid under gears. But she was cornered. A dead end.

She turned to face them.

Squad Bronze laughed. One of them, a boy with cybernetic arms, punched his palm.

Then, a bell tolled.

_DOOOOONG._

The sound rolled across the city, shaking the rust from the beams.

One O'Clock.

Angelica checked her pad. "Shift change!"

The city shuddered.

The two factory blocks flanking the alleyway didn't just vibrate; they moved. They slid together on massive underground rails, closing the gap like a vice.

The girl from Squad Glass saw it. She didn't hesitate. She dove through a narrowing gap in the wall, rolling into a maintenance hatch.

Squad Bronze was too slow. Or too arrogant.

They tried to hold the walls apart. The boy with the cybernetic arms braced himself, pushing against the encroaching steel. Sparks flew as his servos whined.

"Push!" he screamed.

It was futile. The city was a machine with million-ton hydraulic pressure.

The walls slammed shut.

There was a sound. A wet, sickening _pop_, like a grape being stepped on. Then, the screech of metal on metal as the buildings locked into their new configuration.

Liquid red splashed out from the seam where the buildings met.

Silence.

Angelica covered her mouth, fighting the urge to vomit. Ria looked away, her face pale.

"Dexterity check failed," Kaelen said softly.

He didn't look away. He watched the blood drip from the seam.

"They were squashed," Angelica whispered. "Vane didn't just build an obstacle course. He built a meat grinder."

"Efficiency," Kaelen repeated. "The weak are filtered out by the environment. If you cannot adapt, you become lubrication for the gears."

He turned to them.

"We move now," he said. "Before the next shift. Ward, plot a course. Keep us out of the friction zones."

Angelica looked at the map. She looked at the blood on the street below.

"I need a minute," she said, her voice shaking. "To calculate."

"You have thirty seconds," Kaelen said. "The gears wait for no one."

Angelica ignored him. She sat down on the rusted grating of the water tower, ignoring the vertigo of being fifty feet above a shifting city. She pulled her datapad close, shading the screen from the grey light.

"Aeon," she whispered. "Wake up."

The multi-tool in her pocket vibrated. A small, golden head poked out, mechanical eyes blinking.

_QUERY: ENVIRONMENT HOSTILE. PROBABILITY OF CRUSHING INJURY: 87%._

"Help me map this," she ordered. "Interface with the steam grid. Find the pulse."

Aeon hopped onto her shoulder. His eyes glowed blue, scanning the city. He wasn't looking at the buildings; he was looking at the heat. To a thermal drone, the city was a vascular system of hot pipes and cooling vents.

_SCANNING... PATTERN DETECTED. BASE-12. FIBONACCI SPIRAL. THE CITY IS A CLOCK._

"A clock," Angelica repeated. She looked at the scrolling data on her pad. "It's not just moving; it's counting down. Every sector is a digit."

She traced the lines on the map.

"Sector 7 is the minute hand. Sector 8 is the hour hand. They rotate independently on a central gear shaft located under the Spire."

She looked up at Kaelen.

"We're on the minute hand," she said. "It moves every sixty seconds. If we're standing on the seam when it ticks..."

_CRUNCH._

"...we get sheared in half," she finished.

She pointed to a bridge connecting their tower to the next block.

"That bridge," she said. "It's a ratchet mechanism. It only extends when the gear turns forward. We have to time our jump. If we jump too early, we fall. Too late, and the bridge retracts."

"Timing," Kaelen mused. "Physics again."

"Biology," Angelica corrected. "It's a heartbeat. Listen."

She closed her eyes.

She didn't just hear the noise; she felt it. The rhythmic _thump-thump_ of the massive pistons deep underground. It was slow, heavy, and inexorable.

_Thump... Thump..._

"Now!"

She sprinted.

She hit the edge of the tower just as the bridge began to slide out. It was a terrifying leap of faith. For a split second, there was nothing but air under her boots. Then, metal.

The bridge groaned, extending fully. She rolled, coming up in a crouch.

Kaelen and Ria landed beside her a second later.

"Clear," Kaelen said.

Behind them, the bridge snapped back into the tower with a sound like a gunshot. If they had been a second slower...

"Good math," Ria grunted, dusting rust off her knees.

They moved deeper into the city.

The scale of the place was oppressive. It wasn't built for humans; it was built for giants. The doorways were twenty feet tall. The steps were waist-high. It felt like they were rats scurrying through the engine room of a god.

"Why build it like this?" Ria asked, her voice echoing in a canyon of copper pipes. "It's too big."

"Intimidation," Kaelen said. "Vane wants us to feel small. He wants us to know that we are insignificant components in the Great Machine."

"It's working," Angelica muttered.

They reached an intersection.

"Hold," Angelica said, raising a hand.

She checked her pad. _Sector 8. The Hour Hand._

"We're crossing onto the slower gear," she explained. "The relative velocity is different. Be ready for a jolt."

As they waited, movement flash in the peripheral.

"Contacts," Kaelen hissed. "Three o'clock."

They crouched behind a steam vent.

It was Squad Bronze again. Or what was left of them.

Only two remained. The leader—a hulking boy with a jaw like a shovel—and a girl with a sonic-emitter rifle. They looked rattled. They were covered in dust and... other fluids.

They were arguing.

"We should have waited!" the girl screamed. "You pushed him! You pushed him into the gap!"

"He hesitated!" the leader roared back. "Hesitation is failure! We have to keep moving!"

They were standing on a large, circular platform—a turntable used to rotate cargo trains.

"They're not watching the floor," Angelica whispered.

"They are panicked," Kaelen observed. "Panic blinds."

The turntable began to vibrate.

_Tick._

The sound was subtle. A click deep in the mechanism.

Angelica saw it on her thermal scan. The heat spike under the plate.

"The floor is going to drop," she realized. "It's a dump chute. For slag."

She stood up.

"Hey!" she shouted.

Squad Bronze turned. They raised their weapons.

"Don't shoot!" Angelica yelled. "Move! The floor is—"

_CLANG._

The turntable flipped.

It rotated 90 degrees vertical in a fraction of a second.

Squad Bronze didn't even have time to scream. They simply slid off the smooth metal surface and vanished into the darkness below.

A second later, there was a hiss of steam and the smell of burning meat. The dump chute led directly to a furnace.

The turntable flipped back, perfectly horizontal. perfectly empty.

Angelica stood there, her hand still raised in warning.

"Why?" Kaelen asked. He stood beside her, looking at the empty platform. "Why warn them? They are the enemy."

"They're people," Angelica said, her voice hollow. "They were kids."

"They were competitors," Kaelen corrected. "And now they are fuel. You wasted breath saving ashes, Ward. It is inefficient."

"Compassion isn't waste," she snapped, turning on him. "It's what makes us different from the gears."

"Is it?" Kaelen looked at the steam rising from the vents. "Compassion gets you killed in the Silt. Here? It gets you incinerated."

He walked past her, stepping onto the turntable. He tested it with his boot. Solid.

"The mechanism has reset," he said. "It is safe for now. Come."

Ria put a hand on Angelica's shoulder. Her grip was heavy, comforting.

"He's right, Angel," she whispered. "But you're right too. Don't lose that. We need the math, but we need the heart too."

Angelica looked at the empty platform one last time. She imagined the heat. The darkness.

"I won't let us fall," she promised.

"I know," Ria said. "That's why I follow you. Now let's go before the oven timer dings again."

They moved away from the turntable, finding a relative sanctuary in the shadow of a massive coal hopper. The air here was cooler, though dust fell like black snow.

Kaelen knelt, using a piece of slate to draw in the soot-covered ground.

"Situation analysis," he said, his voice dropping to a command frequency. "We are in the Outer Ring. The Clockwork City operates in three concentric circles. The Ring of Gears—where we are now. The Ring of Steam—the industrial sector further in. And the Core—the static zone around the Spire."

He drew three circles.

"Most squads will try to force their way through the streets," he continued. "They will fight the environment. They will die."

He looked up at them. The soot on his face made his eyes look even starker, like chips of violet ice.

"We will not fight the environment. We will use it."

"How?" Ria asked, cracking her knuckles. "I can punch a lot of things, Boss, but I can't punch a city."

"We need a conveyance," Kaelen said. "The trains move materials from the Outer Ring to the Core. We hijack one."

"Hijack a train?" Angelica looked at the moving skylines. "It's not that simple. The tracks shift too. If we get on the wrong line, we end up in a smelter."

"That is why you are the Navigator, Ward." Kaelen pointed at her datapad. "You track the logistics. You find us a line that feeds the Spire, not the furnaces."

Angelica looked at the map. It was a chaotic mess of shifting lines, but under Aeon's decryption, patterns emerged. _Supply lines. Resource allocation._ The Spire needed power. It needed water. It needed food.

"There," she pointed. "Line 4. It's carrying purified water. It runs underground, bypassing the Ring of Steam."

"Good," Kaelen said. "We secure Line 4."

But the city wasn't going to let them walk to it.

As they moved through the canyons of brass, a sound made them stop. It wasn't the rhythmic thumping of the pistons or the hiss of steam. It was a scratching sound. Like a thousand metal fingernails on a chalkboard.

"Movement," Ria whispered, her fists tightening. "Low. All around us."

Angelica scanned the ground. At first, she saw nothing but shadows and rust. Then, the shadows moved.

From the vents, form the cracks in the pavement, from the hollow casings of the gears, they poured out.

Rats.

But not biological rats. These were mechanical. Brass bodies the size of cats, articulated legs ending in needle-sharp claws, and eyes that glowed with a dull, red hunger.

"Scavenger-Drones," Kaelen identified. "They keep the city clean. They eat debris."

"We're not debris!" Angelica said, backing up.

"To them, anything organic is soft," Kaelen said. "And soft things are waiting to be recycled."

There were hundreds of them. A tide of brass vermin. They clicked and hissed, their mandibles snapping.

"Ria," Kaelen said calmly. "Clear a path."

"With pleasure," Ria grunted.

She stomped. The metal roof buckled under her boot. The shockwave sent the first wave of rats skittering back. Then, she charged.

She was a wrecking ball. She grabbed a steam pipe, ripped it from the wall, and swung it like a club.

_CRUNCH._

Metal scattered. Gears flew. The rats shrieked—a high-pitched electronic squeal—as they were smashed into spare parts.

But there were too many. They swarmed over Ria's legs, biting at her jumpsuit.

"Get off!" she roared, kicking them away. Her skin flashed steel-grey where they bit, breaking their teeth, but they were relentless.

One of them leaped at Angelica.

She dodged, swatting it with her datapad. It hit the ground, rolled, and sprang back. It hissed, mandibles spreading to reveal a spinning saw-blade in its throat.

"Variables," she muttered. "Weak point. Where is the weak point?"

Aeon chirped from her pocket. _TARGET: THORAX. POWER CORE EXPOSED._

Angelica didn't have a weapon. She had a multi-tool.

She flicked it to "Laser Cutter."

As the rat leaped again, she didn't dodge. She stepped in. She drove the tool into the rat's chest and thumbed the switch.

_ZZEEEERT._

The rat convulsed as the laser severed its power coupling. It dropped dead at her feet, smoke pouring from its chassis.

"Nice aim!" Ria yelled, punting a rat off the roof.

Kaelen wasn't fighting. He was walking.

The rats swarmed him, but they didn't touch him. Every time one leaped, it was swatted aside by an invisible hand. Gravity. He was surrounded by a repulsive field that crushed anything entering his personal space.

_Crunch. Splat. Snap._

He walked through the swarm like a man walking through a light rain.

"Inefficient," he boredly commented, crushing a rat with a gesture. "They are wasting energy."

He reached the edge of the roof and looked back at them.

"Are you finished playing with the vermin?"

Ria smashed the last rat into a pancake with her pipe. She was breathing hard, scratched and bleeding from a dozen small nicks, but grinning.

"Just warming up," she said.

Angelica wiped oil from her face. She looked at the dead rat at her feet. She picked it up.

"Souvenir?" Kaelen asked.

"Spare parts," Angelica said, pocketing a servo-motor. "You never know."

Kaelen shook his head. "Scavenger."

"Survivor," she corrected.

They moved on, leaving a carpet of brass corpses behind them. The city watched them go, its gears grinding in simulated frustration.

He looked at Ria.

"Ria, you are the Ram. Your role is point defense. If something blocks the track—be it a barricade or another squad—you remove it. Kinetic force is authorized."

"Understood," Ria grinned. "I'll be the cowcatcher."

"And you?" Angelica asked. "What's your role?"

Kaelen stood up, wiping the soot from his hands.

"I am the Executioner," he said simply. "While you navigate and Ria breaches, I ensure that any competition trailing us... ceases to trail us."

The way he said it—so flat, so matter-of-fact—sent a chill down Angelica's spine.

"You mean you'll kill them," she said.

"I mean I will remove variables from the equation," Kaelen corrected. "There are three slots. There are forty-eight remaining candidates. The math dictates subtraction."

"We don't have to kill everyone," Angelica argued. "We just have to be faster."

"Speed is a factor," Kaelen agreed. "But elimination is a certainty. Do not be naive, Ward. Squad Gold isn't going to race us. They are going to hunt us. If we do not hunt back, we are prey."

He looked at the distant Spire.

"And I," he whispered, his voice vibrating with a dark, gravitational resonance, "am no one's prey."

A bell tolled in the distance. _Quarter past._

A siren wailed.

"Movement!" Ria shouted, pointing north.

A massive gear-train was thundering towards them, riding a track that had just slotted into place. It was a cargo hauler, heavily armored, belching black smoke.

"That's not Line 4," Angelica shouted over the roar.

"No," Kaelen said, his eyes narrowing.
"That is Squad Gold's transport."

On top of the train, standing like golden gods against the smog, were three figures. The boy with the perfect hair—Jason Aris, the son of the Head of Medicine. The girl with the cybernetic eyes—Tess Vane, the Headmaster's niece. And...

Lydia.

She saw them. She pointed.

And she smiled. It wasn't a friendly smile. It was the smile of a cat that had just cornered a mouse.

"Squad Iron!" Lydia's voice boomed over a loudspeaker mounted on the train. "So nice of you to join the race. We were worried you'd already been recycled."

She leaned over the railing, her golden hair whipping in the wind.

"We have a proposition for you, Kaelen," she shouted. "Surrender Ward. We know she's a variable. Hand her over, and we'll let you and the giant walk away. We might even give you a ride to the Core."

Kaelen didn't yell back. He just watched them, his expression bored.

Jason stepped forward. He leveled a heavy-looking rifle at them. It wasn't standard issue. It was a prototype railgun.

"Don't be stupid, Night," Jason called out. "You're outnumbered. You're outgunned. And honestly, you're outclassed. Dropping a mechanic into the Arena? It's cruel. Let us put her out of her misery."

Angelica felt a cold knot of anger in her stomach. "Misery?" she muttered. "I'll show you misery."

"Ignore them," Kaelen said softly. "They are posturing. They are trying to provoke a reaction. Emotion leads to mistakes."

"I'm not emotional," Angelica hissed. "I'm calculating."

"Good," Kaelen said. "Calculate the trajectory of that cannon."

The turret on the train swivelled towards them. It was a massive, brass-plated howitzer.

"Run!" Angelica screamed.

"No," Kaelen ordered. "Engage."

"What?" Ria looked at him like he was crazy. "Engage a train? With a cannon? Kaelen, I'm strong, but I'm not _catch-a-shell_ strong."

"We don't fight the train," Kaelen said, his hands beginning to glow with violet energy. The air around his fingers warped, the light bending into a singularity. "We derail it."

He looked at Angelica.

"Mechanic! The track switch! Calculate the leverage point!"

Angelica looked at the junction ahead. A massive lever controlled the track divergence. If she could trip it...

"It's hydraulic!" she yelled, her mind racing through the schematics of standard heavy-rail switches. "I can't move it manually! It takes three thousand PSI to cycle!"

"I don't need you to move it," Kaelen said. "I need you to tell me where to hit it so the system fails."

The train was closing. The cannon barrel spun up. _Whirrrrrr._

_Variables,_ Angelica thought. _Mass. Velocity. Impact point._

She scanned the mechanism. A small pressure valve on the side. It was painted red.

"The valve!" she pointed. "The red casing! If you rupture it, the pressure release will slam the switch!"

"Ria!" Kaelen barked. "Shield!"

Ria stepped in front of them, slamming her fists together. Her skin turned to organic steel. Her stance widened, rooting herself to the metal roof.

_BOOM._

The cannon fired.

A shell of concussive force slammed into Ria. She grunted, sliding back three feet, her boots carving deep, sparking furrows in the metal roof. The impact sounded like a bell being struck by a sledgehammer.

"Hold!" she roared, her metal skin groaning under the stress.

"Now!" Kaelen thrust his hand forward.

A bolt of pure gravity—a singularity bullet—shot from his palm.

It hit the red valve.

_HISSSSS._

The valve exploded. High-pressure steam vented violently. The hydraulic arm lost tension.

_CLANT-CHUNK._

The massive track switch slammed over.

The rails didn't lead straight anymore. They curved.

Sharp left.

Directly into a cooling tower.

The train hit the curve at sixty miles an hour.

It didn't turn. Physics denied it.

The wheels screamed. Sparks showered like fireworks. The engine block lifted off the rails.

It was slow motion chaos. The train detailed, plowing sideways into the concrete base of the tower.

_CRASH._

Dust and debris exploded outwards. The cooling tower groaned and collapsed, burying the train in tons of rubble.

Silence returned, save for the hiss of escaping steam.

"Subtraction," Kaelen said calmly, lowering his hand.

Angelica stared at the wreckage. "Are they..."

"Dead?" Kaelen shrugged. "Gold is durable. They are likely bruised. But they are delayed. And delay is defeat."

He turned to them.

"We have an opening. Line 4 is two blocks east. Move."

He started running.

Ria shook her metallic arms, the steel fading back to skin. She looked at Angelica.

"He's scary," she whispered. "But he's effective."

"Yeah," Angelica murmured, looking at the ruin of the train. "That's what I'm afraid of."

She followed them.

The Selection had begun. And the gears were already stained with intentions of war.
