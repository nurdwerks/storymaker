## Chapter 13: Ria's Decline

### Scene 1: The Rusting

- **Key Event:** The chapter opens with Ria on guard duty at the perimeter of the survivor camp, located in the damp, freezing sublevels of the Foundation.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She is physically uncomfortable, shifting her weight constantly. She ignores the cold because she expects to be immune to it, but she feels a strange, grinding friction in her right knee joint every time she moves.
- **Key Event:** Ria attempts to perform a routine weapon check. When she tries to disengage the safety on her scavenged rifle, her thumb locks up. The servo-actuator in her hand buzzes loudly, struggling against resistance, but the digit refuses to bend.
- **Key Event:** She uses her other hand to force the finger closed, hearing a sound like crunching gravel. For the first time since her "Iron Selection," she feels a phantom sensation of pain—not in the flesh, but in the metal.
- **Key Event:** Ria examines her arm under the harsh light of a glow-rod. She discovers that the gunmetal-grey sheen of her skin is marred by patches of reddish-brown discoloration spreading from her wrist rivets.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She instinctively tries to scrub the spot off with spit and a rag, treating it like dirt. When it doesn't come off, she realizes it is part of her. She pulls her sleeve down immediately to hide it, terrified that looking "broken" will lose her the position of dominance she holds in the group.
- **Key Event:** A scavenger patrol (Red-Eye Gang) tests the perimeter. Ria engages them. She spots a target and triggers her Titan-Form strength to leap over a barricade.
- **Key Event:** Mid-leap, her hip joint seizes completely. Instead of a superhero landing, she crashes awkwardly into a pile of crates, dropping her weapon.
- **Key Event:** The scavengers see her stumble and rush her. Ria has to fight from the ground, unable to stand. She uses brute force to crush a scavenger's skull with a loose pipe, but her movements are jerky and uncoordinated, lacking her usual fluid lethality.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — As she fights, she is screaming in frustration, not at the enemy, but at her own body. "Move! damn you, move!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica arrives with a kinetic blast to scatter the remaining scavengers, saving Ria from being overwhelmed. Ria snaps at her, rejecting the help instantly.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I slipped. The floor is wet. Don't look at me like that."

### Scene 2: The Diagnosis

- **Key Event:** Back in the makeshift infirmary, Angelica forces Ria to sit down. Dr. Aris is summoned despite Ria's threats to break his nose if he touches her.
- **Key Event:** Aris activates his "Sleepless Eye" goggles and performs a deep-tissue scan of Ria's arm. He projects a hologram of her internal structure for the group to see.
- **Key Event:** The hologram reveals the truth: it is not simple oxidation. It is a bio-technical fungus—a mutated strain of the ship's waste-recycling microbes—that eats the specific alloy seals used in Undercity cybernetics.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "It's not rust, Ria. It's a colony. You're being eaten. Specifically, the interface between your nervous system and the plating. It likes the electricity."
- **Key Event:** Aris explains that the fungus is traveling up her neural cables. If it reaches the base of her skull (the Titan-Node), it will fuse her brain stem to the metal, effectively lobotomizing her into a living statue.
- **Key Event:** Ria stares at her hand, which is now trembling uncontrollably. The "twitch" she usually uses to test her numbness is now a symptom of her loss of control.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She asks the pragmatic question first, ignoring the horror. "Can we kill it? Do we have fungicide? Bleach? Acid?"
- **Key Event:** Aris shakes his head. The fungus is shielded by her own armor. To kill it, they need to expose the nerves.
- **Key Event:** Aris outlines the only treatment option: "Excision." He must surgically remove the affected metal plating, scrape the fungus off the organic nerve endings, and then sear the wounds. He cannot replace the metal because they have no spare parts.
- **Key Event:** This means Ria will lose 30% of her armor. She will be smaller, lighter, and softer.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You want to peel me? I worked for ten years to cover that skin. I'm not going back to being soft. Soft things die down here."

### Scene 3: The Choice

- **Key Event:** Ria storms out of the infirmary, refusing the surgery. She retreats to the boiler room—the warmest place in the camp—and sits alone in the dark.
- **Key Event:** She tries to weld a scrap plate over the rusting spot on her arm, thinking she can just "patch" it. The heat of the welder causes the fungus to flare, sending a spike of agony through her that makes her black out for a second.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet finds her curled up on the floor, clutching her burning arm. Lisbet stays at a safe distance due to her static charge.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet uses her datapad to show Ria a simulation: The "Lock-In" rate. At the current rate of decay, Ria will be fully paralyzed in 48 hours. She will be conscious, but unable to blink.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "I know you're scared of being weak. But if you lock up, you're not a soldier anymore. You're just scenery. Heavy scenery."
- **Key Event:** Ria admits to Lisbet that she isn't afraid of the pain; she is afraid of the sensation. She has spent her life numbing herself to the world. If Aris removes the metal, the nerves will be exposed to the air.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — "I don't remember how to feel things, Glitch. What if it hurts too much? What if I can't turn it off?"
- **Key Event:** Lisbet offers a compromise. She can use her nanites to temporarily bridge the neural gaps during the surgery, dampening the input so Ria doesn't go into shock. But Ria has to trust Aris with the knife.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "You're not a machine, Ria. Machines can be replaced. You're my sister. Don't let the metal kill the person."
- **Key Event:** Ria looks at her rusted hand, then at Lisbet's terrified face. She realizes that her stubbornness is hurting the people she claims to protect.
- **Key Event:** Ria stands up, the gears grinding audibly. "Get the Doc. Tell him to bring the big pliers."

### Scene 4: The Surgery

- **Key Event:** The operation takes place on a metal workbench. There is no anesthetic because they ran out weeks ago. Aris uses a bottle of industrial solvent to sterilize a rivet-gun and a pry-bar.
- **Key Event:** The group (Angelica, Lisbet, Corinne) stands guard around the room, facing outward to protect Ria while she is vulnerable. This reversal of roles—the tank being protected by the squishies—shames Ria deeply.
- **Key Event:** Aris begins. He uses the pry-bar to leverage the chest-plate off Ria's shoulder. The sound of metal tearing wetly from flesh echoes in the room.
- **Key Event:** Ria refuses a bite-stick. She stares at the ceiling, counting the rivets. She enters a trance state, dissociating from the body on the table.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She forces herself to watch Aris work in the reflection of a hanging light. She wants to see the "rot" being pulled out. She needs to know that the weakness is gone.
- **Key Event:** Aris exposes the fungal cluster—a black, fibrous mass pulsing around her brachial nerve. It reacts to the light, tightening its grip.
- **Key Event:** Aris has to cut it away with a scalpel. He bumps a nerve. Ria's entire body arches off the table. She lets out a sound that isn't a scream—it’s a mechanical roar of overtaxed vocal cords.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet, crying, channels a low-voltage current into Ria's feet, overloading the pain receptors with white noise to give her relief.
- **Key Event:** Corinne, the squeamish aristocrat, steps in to help Aris hold the retractors when his hands start to shake from exhaustion. Corinne's face is pale, but she doesn't look away.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Corinne** — She wipes blood off Ria's face with a silk handkerchief. It ruins the silk. She doesn't care.
- **Key Event:** Aris finishes the excision. He cauterizes the open wounds with a soldering iron. The smell of burning ozone and meat fills the room.
- **Key Event:** Ria lies on the table, panting. Her shoulder is now half-metal, half-scarred flesh. It looks raw and ugly.
- **Key Event:** Aris offers to bandage it. Ria sits up, shaking. She touches the raw skin. She flinches violently—the air feels like sandpaper.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the pile of rusted metal on the floor—her former armor. She spits on it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "No sleep. Watch the work. I want to see what's left when the armor comes off."
- **Key Event:** Angelica approaches and puts a hand on Ria's good shoulder (the metal one).
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You're still Ria. Even without the chrome. Remember that."
- **Key Event:** Ria stands, unsteady but mobile. Her joint moves smoothly. The rust is gone. She picks up her rifle. It feels heavier now that she has less hydraulic assist, but she grips it until her knuckles turn white.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Let's get back to the perimeter. I'm not done killing things yet."
