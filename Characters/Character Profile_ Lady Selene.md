## I. Role in the Story

Lady Selene is Matriarch Lilith Night’s chief administrator and aesthetician. She is responsible for maintaining the "Night Look" and the rigid standards of the Matriarchy.

- **The Interaction:** She views Angelica as a "failed experiment," a biological error that needs to be corrected or discarded.
- **The Control:** She fusses over Kaelen's appearance, adjusting his collars and smoothing his hair in a way that signals his "ownership" by the family, and Angelica's exclusion from his life.

## II. Book 3 Integration: The Unmaking

- **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 13 (Nightfall).
- **The Scene:** Scene 2: The Unmasking.
- **The Event:** During the seizure of the estate, Selene is caught by Grey's drones. A biological scan reveals she has been embezzling family funds to buy black-market "Youth-Grafts."
- **The Fate:** The droids strip the grafts from her face, literally peeling away her beauty. She is revealed as a withered, desperate old woman. Kaelen watches this, realizing the "Night Standard" was always a lie.
- **Status:** **Ruined.** She is dragged away by the Wardens for "Bio-Fraud."
