## Chapter 02: The First Geometric

### Scene 1: The Observation Deck

- **Key Event:** The alarms sound as an object decloaks off the bow. It is a perfect matte-black Sphere, absorbing all light. It hangs motionless against the stars.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She immediately calculates firing solutions, only to realize the targeting computers can't lock onto "zero albedo."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "It's not a ship. It's a hole in the sky."

### Scene 2: The Mess Hall

- **Key Event:** Rumors spread rapidly among the crew. Zephyr tries to sell "Alien Insurance" to a terrified junior engineer, masking his own fear with commerce.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He checks his Credit Counter. It flicks to "ERROR" for a second when he looks at the Sphere.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Five credits says it's friendly. Ten says it eats us. Hedge your bets, kid."

### Scene 3: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** Vane orders the comms officer to hail the object. He uses the formal "First Contact" protocols of the Zenith.
- **Key Event:** The Sphere does not respond. It emits a low-frequency hum that vibrates the teeth of everyone on the bridge.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "This is Prelate Vane of the Aeterna. We claim this sector by right of salvage. Respond."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Comms Officer:** "No response, Prelate. It's just... listening."
