## Chapter 5: The Shaman

### Scene 1: The Visit

- **Key Event:** The Night.
- **Detailed Description:** Night has fallen over the village. The jungle, which is threatening by day, becomes a nightmare by night. The air is filled with the screams of nocturnal predators, the chirping of insects the size of hands, and the rustle of things moving in the dark. Angelica sits in her bamboo cage. She is trying to sleep sitting up, her back against the rough bars, but adrenaline keeps her awake.
- **Key Event:** The Visitor.
- **Detailed Description:** A figure separates itself from the shadows. It is not the guard, a large man who is snoring loudly against a nearby tree. It is the man with the glasses. The Shaman. He moves silently, his bare feet making no sound on the packed earth.
- **Key Event:** The Appearance.
- **Detailed Description:** Up close, Angelica sees the details. He wears a vest made of untreated, stiff leather. The pockets are filled with tools—bone wrenches, flint drills, coils of vine, and dried herbs. He smells of earth and medicinal plants.
- **Key Event:** The Poke.
- **Detailed Description:** He squats by the bars. He doesn't hold a spear. He holds a smooth, polished stick. He pushes the stick through the bars and pokes her shoulder. Hard.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ow! Stop poking the merchandise! I'm not a fruit."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Shaman:** (Nodding to himself) "Solid. Flesh. Not a spirit. Spirits pass through wood."

- **Key Event:** The Glasses.
- **Detailed Description:** He adjusts his glasses. In the moonlight, Angelica sees the lenses clearly. They are made of cloudy quartz, ground by hand with incredible patience. The frames are made of twisted wire.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering) "Optics. Crude, but functional. You ground those yourself. You understand focal length."

- **Key Event:** The Assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** She realizes he isn't staring at her with fear or worship. He is studying her. He is analyzing her clothes, her zipper, the synthetic fabric of her suit.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ _Curiosity. That I can work with. He’s a scientist in a loincloth. My first ally._

### Scene 2: The Test

- **Key Event:** The Canvas.
- **Detailed Description:** The Shaman clears a patch of dirt in front of the cage with his hand. He smooths it until it is a flat canvas.
- **Key Event:** The First Symbol.
- **Detailed Description:** He takes his stick and draws a circle. Then a dot in the center. Then a smaller circle orbiting it. He looks at her, raising a bushy eyebrow.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ _Heliocentric model. Sun. Earth. Orbit. He's testing me. He wants to know if I understand the sky._

- **Key Event:** The Response.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica reaches through the bars. She smooths a section of dirt next to his drawing. She picks up a twig. She draws a right-angled triangle.
- **Key Event:** The Theorem.
- **Detailed Description:** On the sides of the triangle, she draws squares corresponding to the length of the sides. A squared plus B squared equals C squared. The Pythagorean theorem. Universal geometry.
- **Key Event:** The Recognition.
- **Detailed Description:** The Shaman's eyes widen behind his quartz lenses. He leans in closer. He grabs his stick and draws a parabola—the trajectory of a thrown object.
- **Key Event:** The Variable.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica adds a symbol for wind resistance—a vector force pushing against the parabola.
- **Key Event:** The Dialogue.
- **Detailed Description:** They work in silence. Drawing. Erasing. Modifying. It is a conversation without words, spoken in the universal language of mathematics.

### Scene 3: The Connection

- **Key Event:** The Immersion.
- **Detailed Description:** For an hour, the jungle fades away. The guard, the cage, the fear—it all disappears. There is only the dirt and the math. The ground is covered in equations, diagrams of leverage, and sketches of pulleys.
- **Key Event:** The Emotion.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica feels a lump in her throat. Since the Fall, since the crash, she has been surrounded by chaos. By noise. By survival. This—this is order. This is truth.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Universal constants. Gravity is the same here as it is in the Zenith. Math doesn't change."

- **Key Event:** The Smile.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the Shaman. He is smiling. It is a genuine, toothy smile that transforms his severe face. He points to his chest.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Shaman:** "Torin."

- **Key Event:** The Introduction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica points to herself.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Angelica."

- **Key Event:** The Understanding.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin tests the syllables, rolling them around his mouth.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "An-gel-ee-ka. Good math. Strong math."

### Scene 4: The Name

- **Key Event:** The Departure.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin stands up. He wipes his dust-covered hands on his vest. He looks at the guard, who grunts in his sleep but doesn't wake.
- **Key Event:** The Look.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks back at Angelica. There is no fear in his eyes anymore. Only hunger. The insatiable hunger for knowledge that marks a true engineer.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ _He isn't looking at the dirt. He is looking at the potential. He sees the code in the world. I'm not a demon to him. I'm a library. And he is the first person I've met who wants to read the book._

- **Key Event:** The Gift.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin reaches into his vest pocket. He pulls out a piece of dried, crystallized fruit. He hands it to her through the bars.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Eat. Brain needs fuel. Thinking is hungry work."

- **Key Event:** The Gratitude.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica takes it. She bites into it. It is sweet, tart, and real.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Thank you, Torin."

- **Key Event:** The Promise.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin points to the dirt, now covered in their scribbles.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Tomorrow. More math. Then... maybe we talk about the door."

- **Key Event:** The Hope.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica watches him slip back into the shadows.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ideally. But maybe bring a key next time? Or a crowbar. I can show you the math for leverage."
