## Chapter 02: Lord Cromwell

### Scene 1: The Summons

- **Key Event:** Following her preparation by Lady Corinne, Angelica Ward is escorted by two silent Peacekeepers to the Office of the Steward at the very Apex of the Command Spire.
- **Detailed Description:** The elevator ride is a silent, vertical journey that seems to last an eternity. The doors open onto a waiting room that feels more like a museum than an office. Unlike the sleek, holographic aesthetic of the rest of the Zenith, this room is filled with physical artifacts. Books bound in real leather line the walls, their spines cracked with age. An antique ticking clock sits on a mantelpiece, its rhythmic sound filling the silence. The air smells of old paper and dust, a stark contrast to the sterile, recycled atmosphere of the lower decks. Angelica feels a strange sense of vertigo; she is at the highest point of her world, yet surrounded by the past.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels the trap closing around her. She has been dressed up, scrubbed clean, and now summoned. She knows she is being evaluated. She fights the urge to fidget with the lace of her new dress, forcing her hands to remain still at her sides. She reminds herself that she is not a prisoner, but a player. She needs to learn the rules of this new game.

### Scene 2: The Spider

- **Key Event:** Angelica enters the inner office and meets Lord Cromwell, the High Steward of the Zenith.
- **Detailed Description:** The inner office is dominated by a massive desk made of dark, polished wood. Behind it sits Lord Cromwell. He is a small, withered man with skin like parchment and eyes that look like beads of black glass. He is writing in a ledger with a fountain pen, the scratch of the nib loud in the quiet room. On his shoulder sits his Bond-Animal: "The Scriptor," a mechanical spider made of brass and clockwork. The spider has multiple limbs, each holding a quill or a magnifying lens. It mimics Cromwell's movements, scuttling across the ledger to blot ink or turn pages. On the wall behind Cromwell, a holographic portrait of **The Emperor** flickers—the golden armor, the unblinking eyes, the face of divine authority. It is not alive, but it seems to watch everything in the room.
- **Key Event:** Cromwell reviews Angelica's file.
- **Detailed Description:** Cromwell does not look up immediately. He finishes a sentence, dots an 'i', and then closes the book. He picks up a stack of paper—Angelica's dossier. He reads from it in a dry, monotone voice. He lists her crimes: arson in Sector 4, theft of state property (the drone), treasonous speech during the selection. He lists them not with anger, but with the detached boredom of an accountant auditing a tax return. Above his shoulder, the holographic Emperor's eyes seem to follow Angelica.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Cromwell:** "Your file is... messy. Arson. Theft of state property. Treason. Unauthorized modification of Class-A technology. You seem to have a talent for disorder, Miss Ward."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I don't like disorder. I fix things. If I broke something, it's because it wasn't working right."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She refuses to be cowed by his authority. She frames her rebellion as "maintenance," asserting her identity as an engineer rather than a criminal.

### Scene 3: The Threat

- **Key Event:** Cromwell reveals the true nature of his power: he controls the resources.
- **Detailed Description:** Cromwell stands up and walks to the window. He gestures to the city below. He explains that Vane may be the face of the Zenith, but Cromwell is the spine. He controls the food rations, the water cycles, the air scrubbers. He calculates the caloric needs of every citizen.
- **Key Event:** Cromwell uses a holographic display to show Leo Ward.
- **Detailed Description:** He waves his hand, and a section of the air turns into a screen. It shows a live feed of a detention cell. Leo is sitting on a cot, reading a book. He looks safe, but the cell is stark. Cromwell explains the arrangement. Leo is being kept in "protective custody." His medicine is being administered on a schedule set by Cromwell.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica's heart stops. Seeing Leo alive is a relief, but seeing him in a cage is a torment. She realizes the depth of the leverage they have. They aren't just threatening to kill him; they are threatening to _manage_ his death. They have turned his life into a line item in a ledger.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Cromwell:** "I am the Steward. My job is to ensure the numbers balance. And right now, you are a deficit. You are noise in my system. I do not like noise."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Cromwell:** "The boy requires 40 milligrams of stablizers daily. Expensive. But manageable. If you are useful, the ledger balances. If you are not... I stop the shipment. You behave, he eats. You rebel, he starves. It is simple calculus."

### Scene 4: The Choice

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes she cannot fight Cromwell with force.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the old man. He is frail. She could snap his neck in seconds. But she knows that if she hurts him, the order goes out, and Leo dies. Violence is useless against bureaucracy. This isn't a fight; it's a contract negotiation. She has to play the role they want—the compliant tool—until she can find a way to change the terms.
- **Internal Conflict:** She hates the feeling of submission. It burns in her throat like bile. But she swallows it. She decides to be the "deficit" he fears, but a hidden one. She will be the rust that eats the machine from the inside, silent and slow, until the whole thing collapses.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She recognizes the "banality of evil" in Cromwell's bureaucratic approach. He isn't a monster who enjoys pain; he's a functionary who simply doesn't care. That makes him more dangerous. She chooses a controlled response, hiding her rage behind a mask of compliance.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I understand the math, my Lord. I will balance your books."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Cromwell:** "Good. See that you do. You are dismissed."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering as she leaves) "I hear you. But sound travels both ways, my Lord. And even whispers can start avalanches."

### Scene 5: The Rivalry

- **Key Event:** General Ironwood intercepts Angelica.
- **Detailed Description:** As Angelica leaves the office, she runs into **General Ironwood** in the waiting room. He is the opposite of Cromwell—tall, broad-shouldered, wearing a uniform adorned with medals. He looks at Angelica with critical appraisal, not as an accountant looks at a ledger, but as a butcher looks at a side of beef. He nods to Cromwell's door. The tension between the two men is palpable even through the closed door. Ironwood represents the brute force of the Zenith; Cromwell represents its secrets. They hate each other.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Accountant's finished with you, recruit? Now the real work begins. He counts the bodies. I make them. Don't disappoint me on the field."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Establishes his direct, martial philosophy and his disdain for the bureaucratic manipulation of the Steward.

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Scenes:** Break each chapter into component scenes based on location changes, time jumps, or POV shifts.
2. **Key Events:** Bullet point all significant actions, revelations, or plot progressions.
3. **Detailed Description:** This is the primary place to expand the word count. Describe the environment, the sensory details (smell, sound, temperature), and the specific physical actions of the characters.
4. **Internal Conflict:** Add this section where characters are facing difficult choices or emotional turmoil.
5. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
6. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
7. **Flexibility:** Not every key event requires both a defining moment and dialog—include what applies. You may add custom headers (e.g., **The Memory**, **The Calculation**) to better organize complex information.
