# Character Profile: General Ironwood (The War Machine)

**Archetype:** The Revolutionary / The Cyborg / The Toxic Father **True Sin:** WRATH (A scorching, industrial hatred for the Zenith. Unlike Kaelen’s cold, hereditary resentment, Ironwood’s wrath is a blast furnace. He does not want to change the system; he wants to burn it down, pulverize the ashes, and salt the earth. He loves the war more than the victory). **Virtue Mask:** HOPE (He brands himself as the "Father of the Silt." He sells the dream of liberation. He tells the starving workers that their suffering has meaning, that he is leading them to the Promised Land. He weaponizes Hope to recruit soldiers for his suicide missions).

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Scrapped God

General Ironwood is a terrifying testament to Undercity ingenuity and desperation. He is what happens when a human body is treated like a broken engine—parts replaced with whatever scrap metal was available, welded together by pain and hate.

### 1. The Industrial Frame

- **Stature:** He is massive, standing 6'8" and broad as a blast door. His silhouette is rectangular and unnatural. He moves with the heavy, hydraulic _thud-hiss_ of heavy machinery. He does not walk; he stomps. The floor vibrates when he enters a room.

- **The Flesh Ratio:** He is approximately 60% machine.

  - **Legs:** Both legs are replaced from the hip down with **Loader-Mech Struts**. They are unpainted steel, piston-driven, and end in magnetic clamps that allow him to walk on walls or anchor himself against explosions.

  - **Arms:** His right arm is flesh, but heavily scarred and muscular (the arm he uses to gesture/orator). His left arm is a **Mining Drill Attachment** modified into a gripping claw/cannon.

  - **Torso:** His chest is a cage of reinforced rebar and ceramic plating, protecting his remaining organic organs. You can see the glow of his **Resonance Core** (a stolen battery) pulsing where his heart should be.

### 2. The Face of the Rebellion

- **The Jaw:** His lower jaw was blown off in the "First Uprising" twenty years ago. It has been replaced by a vented steel mandible. When he speaks, his voice is synthesized, deep, and metallic, accompanied by the smell of exhaust. He cannot smile; he can only grind his gears.

- **The Eyes:** One eye is human—pale blue, burning with fanaticism. The other is a **Targeting Array**—a cluster of three red lenses that rotate and zoom independently.

- **The Skin:** The flesh that remains is leathery and grey, permanently stained with grease and soot. He does not bathe; he undergoes "Maintenance." He smells of oil, ozone, and old blood.

### 3. The Hum

Ironwood is never silent. He emits a constant, low-frequency hum (60Hz), the sound of a generator under load. This sound triggers subconscious anxiety in those around him. When he gets angry, the hum rises in pitch to a whine, like a turbine spinning up.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Ironwood rejects the flowing silks of the Zenith. He created the aesthetic of the Rebellion: **Militarized Poverty**.

- **The Greatcoat:** He wears a massive, floor-length coat made from **Thermal Insulation Blankets** (the kind used on pipeworks). It is grey, quilted, and fireproof. The collar is high and stiff, framing his metal jaw. It is stained with the mud of a hundred battlefields.

- **The Medals:** Pinned to his chest are "medals" he made himself. They are not gold; they are the dog tags of Zenith Wardens he has killed, melted down and stamped with the names of Silt sectors. He wears the death of his enemies as decoration.

- **The Beret:** A simple, black wool beret. It is the only soft thing he owns. It tilts over his mechanical eye.

- **The Power Cable:** A thick, insulated cable runs from his neck to a battery pack on his belt. It looks like a leash he holds himself.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Ironwood operates on the logic of "Total War." Every interaction is a tactical maneuver.

- **The Grind:** When frustrated, he grinds his metal jaw. It makes a sound like a knife on a whetstone. It sets people’s teeth on edge.

- **The Grip:** When he wants to emphasize a point, he grabs the listener's shoulder with his mechanical claw. He applies just enough pressure to bruise, but not break. It is a reminder: _I could crush you, but I choose not to._

- **The "Father" Tone:** He speaks to his soldiers (especially Ria) with a warm, paternal cadence that contrasts horribly with his synthesized voice. "My child," "My son," "My iron." He uses intimacy to manipulate.

- **Oil Leaks:** His hydraulics are old and imperfect. When he is stressed, black hydraulic fluid leaks from his joints, dripping onto the floor like black blood. He ignores it, but it marks his path.

- **Refusal of Comfort:** He does not sit in chairs (he breaks them). He stands, or he docks himself into a charging station. He views comfort as "Zenith Weakness."

## IV. The Bond: Fenrir and The Pain Toll

Ironwood’s magic is not a partnership; it is a domination. He enslaved his construct.

- **The Beast:** **Fenrir** (The Hive-Wolf).

  - **Appearance:** Fenrir is not a single animal. It is a pack of six **Drone-Wolves** made of scrap metal and Resonance circuitry. They have cameras for eyes and chainsaws for teeth. They circle Ironwood constantly, snapping at the air.

  - **Personality:** Vicious, starving, and loyal only to the signal.

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Manifestation:** **Merge / Hive Mind**. Ironwood does not give verbal commands. He plugs his neural cortex directly into the pack. He _sees_ what they see. He _is_ the pack. He can coordinate six angles of attack simultaneously.

  - **Overt Power:** He can rip a squad of Wardens apart in seconds using the drones as extensions of his own limbs.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Pain (Neural Feedback).**

  - _The Cost:_ To control six bodies at once, Ironwood’s brain is subjected to massive sensory overload. The feedback loops feel like white-hot needles being driven into his skull.

  - _The Reality:_ He lives in constant, blinding agony. He refuses painkillers because they slow his reaction time. He believes the pain clarifies him. "Pain is the fuel of the righteous," he tells Ria. The pain drives his Wrath; he kills to externalize the torture he feels inside.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

**The Miner:** Forty years ago, Ironwood was a foreman in the Helium-3 mines of Sector 11. He was a union man. He believed in peaceful protest.

**The First Uprising:** When the Zenith lowered the oxygen mix to save money (suffocating the elderly), Ironwood led a strike. The Emperor sent the Wardens. They didn't arrest the strikers; they detonated the mine entrance. Ironwood was buried for three weeks. He had to amputate his own crushed legs to crawl out.

**The Resurrection:** He emerged from the rubble not as a man, but as a vengeful spirit. He used mining equipment to rebuild his body. He realized that "Peace is a lie told by the comfortable." He founded the **Iron Front**, a radical terrorist cell.

**The Recruitment of Ria:** He found Ria when she was a starving street fighter. He saw her **Envy** and recognized it as fuel. He took her in, fed her, and taught her that her hunger was a weapon. He became the father she lost, grooming her to be his successor—or his martyr.

**The Inciting Incident (Book 3):** Ironwood sees Angelica’s rise not as a blessing, but as a threat. Angelica represents "Diplomacy" and "Hope via Change." Ironwood represents "Burn it Down." He contacts Ria to ensure the Rebellion stays violent.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 3: The Game of Gears — **_The Dark Mentor_**

- **State:** Ironwood is the shadow general of the Silt. He operates from a bunker deep in the ventilation shafts.

- **The Interaction:** When Ria joins the rebellion, Ironwood embraces her. "Welcome home, daughter." He gives her the rank of Commander.

- **The Lesson:** He teaches Ria that **Angelica** is weak. "She plays dress-up in the Palace while we bleed in the dark. She is not one of us. She is a pet." He manipulates Ria’s envy to drive a wedge between the girls.

- **The Tactic:** He orders the **Helium-3 Drill Attack**. He explicitly orders his men to target civilian infrastructure in the Apex (water filtration, heating). "Let them freeze. Let them know what Sector 12 feels like."

- **The Climax:** He refuses to attend the Peace Summit. He knows it is a trap, but he sends Ria anyway. Why? Because he needs a martyr. If Ria dies, the Silt will rise up in unstoppable fury. He sacrifices his "daughter" to ignite the war.

### Book 4: The Stone Season — **_The Warlord_**

- **State:** The Apocalypse happens. The Zenith falls. Ironwood emerges from the bunker to claim the ruins.

- **The Kingdom:** He establishes a fiefdom in the Industrial Sector. He hoards food and weapons. He kills anyone who isn't "useful."

- **The Conflict with Angelica:** When the survivors pass through his territory, Ironwood blocks the path. He demands they surrender their supplies and leave the weak (Corinne, Aris) behind to die.

- **The Ideology:** "The weak broke the world. The strong will rebuild it." He is a full Social Darwinist.

- **The Confrontation with Ria:** Ria confronts him. She realizes he sent her to die at the Red Wedding.

  - _Ironwood:_ "I gave you a purpose. I made you a legend."

  - _Ria:_ "You made me a suicide vest."

- **The Duel:** Ironwood unleashes Fenrir. Ria merges with Titan. It is Metal vs. Metal. Ironwood is stronger, but he is in agony. Ria uses his pain against him—she targets his neural ports.

- **The Death:** Ria tears the battery pack from his chest. The power dies. Ironwood collapses, his machinery seizing. His last words are not of regret, but of scorn. "You are too soft to hold the world." Ria crushes his metal jaw. She takes his coat and puts it on. She usurps the title of General.

### Book 5 & Onward — **_The Shadow_**

- **Legacy:** Ironwood is dead, but his philosophy lives on in Ria. Every time Ria makes a ruthless decision, she hears his synthesized voice in her head. Her arc in Book 7 (saving the innocent) is her final rejection of Ironwood’s doctrine.

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Ria (The Creator and The Weapon)

- **The Dynamic:** _Thanos and Gamora / Silco and Jinx._

- **The Toxicity:** Ironwood loved Ria, but he loved her utility more. He loved her potential for violence. He validated her worst impulses (Envy/Wrath) and suppressed her best (Loyalty).

- **The Betrayal:** He sent her to the Red Wedding knowing she might die, calculating that her death would be good propaganda. To him, people are ammo. You spend them to win.

### 2. With Angelica (The False Prophet)

- **The Dynamic:** _Revolution vs. Reformation._

- **The Hate:** Ironwood hates Angelica because she was _given_ power (by lineage/bond), whereas he had to build his power from scrap. He views her as a Zenith puppet in Silt clothing.

- **The Clash:** He represents the "Burn it Down" path; she represents the "Fix it" path. Ironwood believes Angelica’s empathy is a weakness that will get everyone killed.

### 3. With Hatcher (The Old War)

- **The Dynamic:** _Cop vs. Criminal._

- **The History:** Twenty years ago, Hatcher was the detective who investigated Ironwood’s terror cells. They have fought before.

- **The Interaction:** In Book 4, they meet again. Hatcher is a Drifter; Ironwood is a Warlord. Hatcher says, "You’re still fighting a war that ended yesterday, Ironwood." Ironwood replies, "The war never ends. The battlefield just changes."

### 4. With The Emperor (The Nemesis)

- **The Dynamic:** _The Grudge._

- **The Motivation:** Everything Ironwood does is to hurt the Emperor. He doesn't care about food or safety; he cares about hurting the man who ordered the mine collapse. His entire existence is a revenge plot disguised as a revolution.

## VIII. Key Quotes & Internal Monologues

- _"Hope is a fuel, Ria. It burns hotter than Resonance. But like any fuel, you have to burn it to get motion. Don't hoard hope; spend it."_ (Book 3)

- _"Look at them. Soft skin. Soft hands. They have never had to dig their own mother out of a collapsed tunnel. They are not human. They are livestock."_ (Referring to the Zenith)

- _"Pain is the only truth. Everything else—love, loyalty, honor—is just a story we tell ourselves to hide from the agony of existence."_

- _"I did not lose my humanity in the mine. I purified it. I cut away the weak parts."_

- _(Last Words)_: _"You... will... break."_
