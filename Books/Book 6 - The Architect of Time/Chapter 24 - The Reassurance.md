## Chapter 24: The Reassurance

### Scene 1: The Stars / Bridge, The _Aeterna_

- **Key Event:** The storm has passed. The _Aeterna_ sits on the launch pad, gleaming in the starlight. The scorch marks on her hull are badges of honor.
- **Key Event:** The jungle is quiet again. The Hunter ships are smoking ruins on the horizon.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands on the bridge. The viewscreen is open to the night sky.
- **Key Event:** Torin stands beside her. He is still wearing his work leathers, stained with grease. But he looks different. Lighter.
- **Key Event:** "We did it," he whispers. "It actually flies."
- **Key Event:** "It does more than fly," Angelica says. "It sings. Did you hear the engine harmonics? Perfect pitch."

### Scene 2: The Destiny / Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica points to a star. A bright yellow dot in the constellation of Cetus.
- **Key Event:** "See that?" she asks.
- **Key Event:** Torin squints. "It's a star."
- **Key Event:** "That is Tau Ceti," Angelica says. "It's twelve light-years away. But at the speed we're going... we'll be there in three months."
- **Key Event:** She brings up a holographic scan. A planet. Blue. Green. Clouds.
- **Key Event:** "It has planets," she says softly. "Green planets. Safe planets. Breathable air. No acid rain. No Blighted."
- **Key Event:** Torin stares at the hologram. He reaches out to touch the blue sphere.
- **Key Event:** "Sanctuary," he breathes.
- **Key Event:** "That's where we go," Angelica promises. "That's the mission. Not just to escape Earth. But to find a home."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "That star? That is Tau Ceti. It has planets. Green planets. Safe planets. That's where we go. Sanctuary."

### Scene 3: The Relief / Bridge

- **Key Event:** Torin sits in the co-pilot's chair. He looks overwhelmed.
- **Key Event:** "I built houses out of mud," he says. "I fixed generators that ran on burning dung. And now... I'm looking at a sun that no human has ever seen up close."
- **Key Event:** Angelica smiles. "It's a G-class star. Like ours used to be. A nuclear furnace. It's beautiful, isn't it?"
- **Key Event:** Torin looks at her. "You know so much."
- **Key Event:** "I had a lot of time to read," Angelica says. "The library of the _Zenith_... it was my only friend for a long time."
- **Key Event:** "And now?" Torin asks.
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes his hand. "Now I have a crew. I have a family."

### Scene 4: The Promise / Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica turns back to the viewport. She places her hand on the glass.
- **Key Event:** She speaks to the universe. To the void. To the Architects who might be listening.
- **Key Event:** "I'm not running," she whispers. "I'm colonizing."
- **Key Event:** She turns to Torin. Her eyes are fierce with tears.
- **Key Event:** "I won't let the dark take you," she vows. "I won't let the cold take my people. Not again."
- **Key Event:** "I have seen the future," she says. "It has your name on it. I promise."
- **Key Event:** She squeezes his hand. "We will write our names across the sky in fire. And no one will ever erase us."
- **Key Event:** Torin nods. He believes her. For the first time in his life, he believes in tomorrow.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She finds the strength to believe they might actually succeed.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I have seen the future. It has your name on it. I promise. ... We will write our names across the sky in fire."
