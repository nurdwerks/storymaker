## Chapter 29: The Warning

### Scene 1: The Sky

- **Key Event:** The setting (Past).
- **Detailed Description:** It is the 29th day of continuous charging for the Hyper-Core. The tribals of the Hidden Valley are celebrating the harvest, oblivious to the technology hum under their feet. Bonfires burn bright orange in the village square, casting long, dancing shadows against the huts. The air is thick with the smell of roasting meat, pine resin, and woodsmoke. Angelica stands alone on the high ridge overlooking the settlement, keeping a vigil she hopes is unnecessary. The sky above is a deep, bruised blue, the stars hidden by the swirling veil of the nebula that protects—and traps—them.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ She scans the horizon purely on instinct. She wishes she had **Lisbet** here with her sensor array. Human eyes are too slow, too limited for the threats that live in the dark.

- **Key Event:** The anomaly.
- **Detailed Description:** Suddenly, the stillness is broken. A streak of fire tears across the heavens. It is not the white flash of a falling meteor. It burns with a violent, unnatural purple hue—the unmistakable signature of high-energy plasma ionization during a controlled atmospheric re-entry. Another streak follows it, parallel and precise. Then another. Six in total. They score the sky like glowing claws, ripping open the night.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Torin! Get the telescope! Now!"

- **Key Event:** The identification.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin sprints up the slope from the Command Hut, breathless. He hands her the heavy, long-range optical scope. She rests it on a rock and trains it on the fire trails. The magnification whirs, snapping the objects into focus. They are jagged, ugly ships made of welded scrap metal, bristling with external weapon mounts, grappling hooks, and oversized thrusters. They are leaking black smoke—engine exhaust from dirty drives.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Are those ours? Did the fleet find us?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. Those aren't fleet ships. They found us."

### Scene 2: The Ships

- **Key Event:** The classification.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica lowers the scope, her hand steady but her face pale. She recognizes the lead ship's silhouette immediately. It is the _Devourer_, a Zenith-class mining frigate that was reported lost ten years ago during the sector collapse. It has been brutally retrofitted for war.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Hunter Ships. Scavengers. Slavers. They survived the Fall by eating everyone else. They patrol the Rim looking for functioning tech... and slaves."

- **Key Event:** The scale.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin looks down at the village. The music is still playing. The children are still chasing each other around the fires. They don't see the monsters descending from the stars.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "How many?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Six ships. Heavy raiding party. Enough firepower to level this mountain and glass the valley."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "They must have tracked the heat blooming from the Key. We lit a fire in the dark, and the wolves saw it."

- **Key Event:** The assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the village—the fragile peace they have built over five years of hard labor and hiding. The elders drying fish, the mothers nursing babies. It is all about to be erased in fire.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We are out of time. The clock just hit zero."

### Scene 3: The Timing

- **Key Event:** The impact.
- **Detailed Description:** A massive sonic boom shakes the ground, knocking Torin to his knees and rattling Angelica's teeth. A kinetic rod—a solid tungsten spear dropped from the lead ship's bombardment bay—slams into the mountain peak a mile above them. _CRACK._ The sound is apocolyptic. The impact shatters the summit. An avalanche of dust, ice, and massive boulders rumbles down the slope, crushing trees like matchsticks, stopping just short of the tree line.

- **Key Event:** The message.
- **Detailed Description:** It wasn't a miss. It was a warning shot. A message delivered in the universal language of mass and gravity. The dust cloud rises, blotting out the moon.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "They missed the village! They're blind firing!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They didn't miss. That was a knock on the door. They want the engine. They tracked the Resonance spike. They know we have a way off this rock."

- **Key Event:** The motive.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica realizes the strategic situation. The Hunters don't want to destroy the _Aeterna_; a functioning interstellar ship is worth more than a planet in this ruined system. It is the ultimate prize.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They aren't here to kill us. They're here to board us. They want the ship intact. But the people... if they take any of us alive, it will be as livestock."

### Scene 4: The Alarm

- **Key Event:** The sprint.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica and Torin slide down the loose scree of the ridge, sprinting toward the Command Hut. Dust from the impact coats their clothes and fills their lungs.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Status! Report!"

- **Key Event:** The core.
- **Detailed Description:** Starla is hunched over the main console, her face illuminated by red warning lights.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Starla:** "Core charge at 99%! The magnetic field is unstable, Angelica! If we launch now, the containment might fail. We could tear the ship apart!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We have no choice! Another kinetic rod hits closer, and we're buried in this valley forever."

- **Key Event:** The decision.
- **Detailed Description:** Another impact shakes the ground, closer to the village gate this time. The earth heaves like a stormy sea. Angelica looks at the sky through the reinforced viewport. The Hunter ships are firing their landing thrusters, descending like vultures circling a carcass. She looks at the ship readings. It's not ready. But neither are they.

- **Key Event:** The signal.
- **Detailed Description:** She slams her hand onto the big red button on the wall. The klaxon wails—a banshee scream that echoes through the valley, drowning out the celebration music and the laughter.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (PA System):** "Sound the alarm! General Quarters! This is not a drill! Get everyone on board! Leave the supplies! Leave the harvest! Leave everything!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We leave in one hour. Ready or not. Anyone not on the ramp gets left behind."
