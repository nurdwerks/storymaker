## Chapter 3: Dr. Aris

### Scene 1: The Lab / The Spire Module

- **Key Event:** The survivor group discovers a buried Science Division module.
- **Detailed Description:** The group—Angelica, Zephyr, Ria, Hatcher, and others—is navigating the ruins of a collapsed industrial sector. The air is thick with dust and the cold is biting. Emerging from a pile of twisted rebar and concrete is a pristine white structure: a detached module from the upper Spire that fell during the initial catastrophe and embedded itself in the factory floor. It is sealed, the airlock lights blinking a warning red. The contrast between the filthy, frozen ruins and the sterile white plastic of the module is stark. It represents a potential treasure trove of medical supplies, food, and heat. However, the biometrics are locked to "Science Division - Clearance Alpha."
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a pang of recognition. She grew up in labs like this. It is a piece of her home, fallen to hell. She tries her own codes, but they are rejected. The system requires a specific genetic marker.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet overrides the lock.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet, the young tech-savant with a neural interface, steps forward. She doesn't type; she connects a cable from her neck port directly to the door panel. Her eyes roll back as she dives into the code. The lock mechanism cycles. Sparks fly as she forces the voltage. The light turns green. The door hisses open, releasing a blast of stale, sterile air that smells of ozone and antiseptic.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet (The Glitch)** — She demonstrates her value to the group, not as a fighter, but as a skeleton key. She wipes a nosebleed away casually, treating the neural damage as a fair price for entry.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Encryption is... complex. High-level Zenith biocodes. But the battery is leaking. I can jump it. Just... don't touch me while I'm grounded."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Open sesame. Good job, Sparky."

### Scene 2: The Scientist / The Main Laboratory

- **Key Event:** The group enters the lab and confronts Dr. Aris.
- **Detailed Description:** The interior is a mess of equipment, cables, and samples. In the center of the chaos sits Dr. Aris. He is surrounded by screens, typing frantically with one hand while eating a nutrient paste with the other. He does not look up when the armed group enters. He is disheveled, his lab coat stained, his hair wild. His eyes are bloodshot, held open by sheer will and stimulants. He is muttering to himself, a constant stream of variables and calculations. The room is freezing; he has diverted all life support power to the server banks.
- **Internal Conflict:** The group is unnerved. They expected a corpse or a monster, not a bureaucrat. Ria raises her weapon, sensing a threat in his manic energy. Hatcher keeps his hand on his knife, watching the shadows. Aris finally spins his chair around. He looks at them not with fear, but with annoyance, as if they are late for an appointment.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris (The Sleepless Eye)** — He displays his defining trait: the refusal to sleep. He claims he has bypassed the biological necessity to maximize his efficiency. He treats the intruders as data points rather than people.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Don't touch the glass. The condensation ruins the view. You're late. Or early. Time is subjective when you remove the circadian rhythm. Sleep is inefficient. I have bypassed the archive function."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Dr. Aris? You were exiled years ago. We thought you were dead."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Exile is just a change of laboratory. And death is a permanent outage. I am neither."

### Scene 3: The Bond / The Demonstration

- **Key Event:** Aris introduces "Nautilus," his hard-light construct.
- **Detailed Description:** As Ria steps closer to intimidate him, Aris taps his temple. The air behind him shimmers. A spectral, bioluminescent shape manifests—a cephalopod made of hard light and neural energy. It is **Nautilus**, his Bond. The construct lashes out with a tentacle, not to strike, but to grab a datapad from a far table and hand it to Aris. It moves with fluid, underwater grace. Aris explains that Nautilus is an extension of his own neural network, allowing him to multitask at inhuman speeds. He can process the group's threat level, analyze their gear, and continue his research simultaneously.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria backs down, impressed and wary. She recognizes a force multiplier. Aris is weak physically, but his mind is a fortress. Aris proposes a "mutual parasitism." He has heat (from the servers) and knowledge. They have guns and food. It is a logical transaction.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Mutual parasitism is the logical conclusion. I have heat. You have guns. I need bodyguards. You need oxygen. Nautilus agrees. The math balances."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "He talks like a machine. I don't like it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We don't have to like him. We just have to use him."

### Scene 4: The Bargain / The Blast Door

- **Key Event:** A deal is struck, with a warning.
- **Detailed Description:** They agree to set up camp in the lab's storage area. Aris points to a heavy blast door at the back of the lab. It is dented from the inside, the metal bulging outward as if something incredibly strong has been pounding on it. There are deep claw marks in the steel. Aris warns them casually to never open it. He refers to the occupant as "The Guest" or "The Variable."
- **Detailed Description:** A low, guttural growl vibrates through the door. It is the sound of hunger. Aris smiles—a manic, twitchy expression. He treats the monster behind the door not as a danger, but as a prized pet or an ongoing experiment.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr shudders. He realizes that Aris is not just a survivor; he is a mad scientist who has been running experiments in the dark for years. The safety of the lab is an illusion. They are sleeping in the cage of a lion tamer.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — He categorizes the horror behind the door as data. His lack of fear is more terrifying than the monster itself.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Death? That is a permanent outage. If you want to avoid it, don't open that door. Make yourselves comfortable. The experiment is just beginning. And please, try to breathe quietly. Nautilus hates the static."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "What's in there, Aris?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** " The future. Or the past. I haven't decided yet."
