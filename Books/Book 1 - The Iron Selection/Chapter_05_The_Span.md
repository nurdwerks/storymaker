## Chapter 5: The Span

### Scene 1: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** Candidates must cross The Span—a mile-long ribbon of transparent poly-glass with no handrails over a two-mile drop, battered by 80 mph winds.

- **Key Event:** Wardens order them to walk. Some candidates freeze, vomit, or refuse to move. The "Iron Squad" moves in a huddle for physics, not camaraderie.

---

### Scene 2: The Push

- **Key Event:** Ria (6'2", built like a linebacker with cement-colored skin from the Silt districts) encounters Angelica struggling against the wind.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're gonna slow us down, twigs."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I'm pacing myself."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Pace this."

- **Key Event:** Ria hip-checks Angelica. On ice-slicked glass in crosswind, this sends Angelica sliding toward the edge. She loses traction and goes over.

---

### Scene 3: The Catch

- **Key Event:** Angelica falls, calculating 14 seconds to impact at terminal velocity with 0% survival chance.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night stops her fall using telekinesis. His shadow peels off the glass, forming a three-dimensional silhouette with ragged wings and void claws (Umbra) that wraps around Angelica and yanks her back onto the bridge.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — Introduced as a figure whose long black coat hangs motionless despite the wind, demonstrating complete control.

---

### Scene 4: The Sacrifice

- **Key Event:** Kaelen slices his own palm with an obsidian knife inscribed with red runes. His blood boils and evaporates into black smoke absorbed by his shadow—the Blood Price for his telekinesis.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "You're bleeding."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Observation: Accurate. Utility: Zero."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen explains his blood pays for the "Iron" cost of magic and warns Angelica not to make him spend blood on her again.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Do not make me spend my blood on you again, Vance. It is expensive. The exchange rate is poor."

- **Key Event:** Ria's challenge prompts Kaelen to turn his cold gaze on her. His shadow ripples threateningly; she backs down.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Aw, looks like Night found a pet. Going to keep it on a leash?"

- **Key Event:** Angelica asks why he saved her. Kaelen claims pragmatic self-interest.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I do not bleed for you, Silt-Rat. I bleed because I hate cleaning up messes. And you would make a very large mess."
