## Chapter 23: The Plan

### Scene 1: The Cylinder Data

- **Key Event:** The revelation in the Bile Ducts.
- **Detailed Description:** The team—Angelica, Zephyr, and Lisbet—are hiding in the "Bile Ducts," a labyrinth of sewage processing tunnels beneath Sector 7. The air is foul, thick with methane and waste heat. They huddle around a portable terminal as Lisbet runs a decryption algorithm on the "Cylinder"—the data storage device stolen from the Museum. A holographic projection flickers to life. It is a video log from Elena Valerius, one of the original Founders. Her face is gaunt, her eyes haunted.

- **Key Event:** The truth about Resonance.
- **Detailed Description:** Elena speaks of the "Great Lie." She reveals that the "Resonance" gifted to the Highborn is not divine magic or evolution. It is radiation poisoning. The ship's primary Engine Core has been leaking for centuries. The Highborn, living in the Zenith near the core, are exposed to lethal doses of exotic radiation. Those who survive mutate and gain powers; the rest die. But the leak is growing. It is poisoning the water, the air, the very soil of the Ag-Domes.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She stares at the data, horrified. She realizes the entire social order—the worship of the Highborn, the oppression of the Lowborn—is built on a literal radioactive catastrophe. The gods aren't divine; they are just tumor-ridden mutants.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elena Valerius (Hologram):** "The 'Resonance'... it's a leak in the primary shielding. We told them it was a gift. We told them it was the Star-Gods. But it's just death. It's what powers their 'miracles,' but it's killing every living thing on this vessel slowly."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's a cancer. The whole ship is a cancer patient pretending to be an athlete."

### Scene 2: The Gambit

- **Key Event:** The plan to access the tower.
- **Detailed Description:** To broadcast this truth, they need access to the Emergency Broadcast Tower in Sector 4. But the tower is locked down, accessible only with top-level codes held by the Sector Governor, Baron Gilded. They need to get close to him. They need a trojan horse. They hatch a plan: Zephyr will "sell" Angelica to the Baron.

- **Key Event:** Entering The Gilded Cage.
- **Detailed Description:** Baron Gilded's club, "The Gilded Cage," is a disgusting display of wealth amidst poverty. The walls are lined with real velvet. The air smells of expensive perfume and roasted meat. Zephyr walks in, dragging Angelica in faux-chains. Angelica plays the part of a captured Lowborn rebel. Baron Gilded sits on his Repulsor Throne—a floating chairogilded with gold leaf. He is obese, his skin dyed a permanent gold, his teeth replaced with diamonds.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded:** "The Sangreal. The famous Angelica Ward. Do you know how much the Duke will pay for a breeder like her? A Silt-Rat with Highborn Resonance? You brought me a fortune, scavenger."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I brought you a commodity. I want my debt cleared. And I want a flight permit."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded:** "Come closer. Let me smell the merchandise."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded:** "You taste like copper, girl. Desperation and blood. My favorite flavor."

- **Character Defining Moment:** **Baron Gilded** — He is introduced in his full grotesque glory. He represents the ultimate corruption of the Zenith—consumption without purpose, wealth without morality.

### Scene 3: The Hack

- **Key Event:** The distraction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica endures the Baron's touch. He inspects her teeth, her hair, treating her like livestock. She forces herself to smile, to feed his ego. She asks about his throne, his collection, keeping him talking. "A man of your stature... the gravity must be a burden. This chair... it is a masterpiece of engineering." Gilded preens, launching into a monologue about the custom repulsor tech.

- **Key Event:** Lisbet's infiltration.
- **Detailed Description:** While Gilded is distracted, Lisbet is outside, wirelessly tapping into the club's security node. She uses Zephyr's cybernetic arm—which is linked to the club's network for the transaction—as a bridge. She navigates the Baron's firewall. It is lazy security, arrogant. She finds the control schematics for the Repulsor Throne. She finds the debt ledger.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She works with surgical precision, her hands flying across her deck. She is the silent killer in this operation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr (whispered to self):** "Almost... there... Com on, you golden bastard, keep talking... tell her about your diamonds..."

### Scene 4: The Fall

- **Key Event:** The execution of the hack.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet finds the "Master Reset" command for the Repulsor Throne. She types it in. `EXECUTE`. Inside the club, the hum of the repulsors dies instantly.

- **Key Event:** The Baron falls.
- **Detailed Description:** Physics takes over. The massive golden chair, no longer supported by anti-gravity fields, slams into the floor. Baron Gilded, who relies on the chair to move his immense weight, spills out of it. He crashes onto the marble floor with a wet thud. He is helpless as a turtle on its back. He flails, unable to stand. The music stops. The patrons gasp.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Baron Gilded** — Total humiliation. The untouchable king is reduced to a helpless, screaming mass on the floor. His power was all borrowed technology.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded:** "NO! MY CHAIR! GET ME UP! GET ME UP! I COMMAND YOU!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Gravity's a bitch, Baron. And so is compound interest."

- **Key Event:** The theft.
- **Detailed Description:** While the guards rush to help the Baron, Angelica grabs the control tablet from the arm of the fallen chair. It contains the Sector Access Codes. She kicks Zephyr. "Run!"

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Debt paid, you piece of shit. Keep the change."

### Scene 5: The Broadcast

- **Key Event:** The escape and realization.
- **Detailed Description:** They escape into the sewers, adrenaline pumping. They have the codes. But they also have new data from Elena's log. The radiation isn't just killing people; it's degrading the navigation AI. The ship is drifting. It is on a collision course with a gas giant. Impact in 30 days.

- **Key Event:** The shift in mission.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the team. The stakes have changed. It's not just about exposing a lie anymore. It's about preventing extinction. She decides to use the codes to hijack the Analog Tower—illegal tech that Vane can't remotely shut down.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She shifts her goal from personal survival/revenge to saving the entire colony. She accepts the role of Savior, even if she hates it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If we tell the truth, the lie dies. And Vane dies with it. But if we don't tell them about the course drift, everyone dies. We don't just fight for a sector. We fight for the ship."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Great. Saving the world. Does that pay better than scavenging?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It pays in not dying, Zephyr."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Fair enough. Let's go make a broadcast."
