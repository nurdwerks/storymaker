## Chapter 2: The Green World

### Scene 1: The Flora

- **Key Event:** The Awakening.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica attempts to access her technology. She taps the wrist-comp on her left arm. The screen is cracked; it flickers once and dies. She taps her earpiece, trying to hail the _Zenith_ or any orbital relay. "Ward to Command. Status report." Heavy static is the only reply. The silence is absolute and terrifying. She is cut off.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Wrist-Comp:** (Garbled Audio) "...ngie... run... diag... nos... tic... Lisbet... offline..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Lisbet? Is that you? Are you in the buffer?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Wrist-Comp:** (Static hiss, then silence)
- **Key Event:** The Sensory Overload.
- **Detailed Description:** She rips off her helmet. The air hits her like a physical weight. It is thick, wet, and heavy. It tastes of loam, rot, and aggressive growth. It is 90% humidity and saturated with oxygen.
- **Key Event:** The Physical Reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** She takes a deep breath and immediately coughs, doubling over. Her lungs burn. It’s too rich.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Oxygen toxicity. The mixture is distinct. Not the recycled, scrubbed air of the Zenith. Not the thin, smog-choked air of the Slums. This is air that feeds giants.
- **Key Event:** The Vision.
- **Detailed Description:** Her eyes adjust to the light. Colors seem to explode. The leaves aren't just green; they are emerald, neon, vibrating with chlorophyllic life. Everything is oversized. A fern the size of a house dominates her vision, its fronds uncurling like the tentacles of a kraken.
- **Key Event:** The Self-Talk.
- **Detailed Description:** She steadies herself against a massive root that feels as hard as iron.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Okay. Step one: Breathe. Step two: Don't hallucinate. Step three: Find a weapon."
- **Key Event:** The Touch.
- **Detailed Description:** She reaches out to steady herself on a flowering plant nearby. The flower, purple and fleshy with vein-like red streaks, snaps shut the moment her finger brushes a petal. Rows of translucent thorns interlock with a wet _click_.
- **Key Event:** The Warning.
- **Detailed Description:** She recoils, snatching her hand back.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Aggressive flora. Note to self: Don't touch the salad. Everything here wants to eat."
- **Key Event:** The High.
- **Detailed Description:** The initial nausea fades, replaced by a sudden, surging euphoria. Her heart rate spikes. Her vision sharpens to a razor's edge. She feels invincible. Faster. Stronger. It's a chemical lie, a side effect of the hyper-oxygenation, but she uses it. She needs the energy.

### Scene 2: The Fauna

- **Key Event:** The Disruption.
- **Detailed Description:** The ground shakes. _Thump. Thump._ It isn't an earthquake. It is a footstep. A rhythmic, heavy impact that sends tremors up through the soles of her boots.
- **Key Event:** The Hiding.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica freezes. Instinct takes over. She dives behind a massive root system, pressing her back into the damp moss. She holds her breath.
- **Key Event:** The Giant.
- **Detailed Description:** A creature steps into the clearing. It moves with a slow, lumbering grace that belies its immense mass.
  - _Description:_ A Megatherium. A giant ground sloth. It is twenty feet tall when it rears up on its hind legs. Its fur is shaggy, matted with moss and small ferns, making it look like a walking hill. Its claws are the size of scythes, curved and wicked.
- **Key Event:** The Display of Power.
- **Detailed Description:** It reaches up to a tree branch as thick as Angelica's torso. With a casual, lazy motion, it snaps the branch. The wood screams as it splinters. The creature shreds the leaves and crunches the wood like celery.
- **Key Event:** The Observation.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stares, wide-eyed. It's a monster. But it's also... majestic. It is a creature of impossible scale, belonging to an epoch that should remain in textbooks.
- **Key Event:** The Shadow.
- **Detailed Description:** A shadow passes overhead, swift and blocking out the sun for a fleeting second. Angelica looks up.
- **Key Event:** The Sky.
- **Detailed Description:** A leather-winged shape glides over the canopy. A Pterosaur. Its crest is a vibrant blue, a flash of color against the white sky.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** She slumps back against the root.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We're not in Kansas anymore. We're in the Cretaceous. Or the Pleistocene. Or... hell, maybe both. The timeline is a mess."

### Scene 3: The Threat

- **Key Event:** The Shift.
- **Detailed Description:** The sloth moves on, its thumping footsteps fading into the dense bush. The jungle goes quiet. Too quiet. The buzz of the insects stops. The bird calls cease.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** A twig snaps. It isn't the heavy, careless crash of a herbivore. It is a sharp, calculated snap. The sound of something testing the ground.
- **Key Event:** The Search.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica spins around, scanning the perimeter. Nothing but ferns and shadows.
- **Key Event:** The Feeling.
- **Detailed Description:** She knows that feeling. Prickles on the back of her neck. The biological warning system that predates higher thought. She is being watched.
- **Key Event:** The Eyes.
- **Detailed Description:** She backs away slowly, keeping the wreckage of her pod to her left. Twin yellow eyes open in the gloom of the undergrowth. They are unblinking, intelligent, and cold.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** A low growl starts. It is sub-sonic, felt in the chest cavity before it is heard. Raising the hair on her arms.
- **Key Event:** The Predator.
- **Detailed Description:** A Smilodon steps out of the shadows.
  - _Description:_ It is sleek, muscle rippling under tawny fur. It is lower to the ground than the sloth, built for speed and power. The sabers are long, ivory white, and stained dark at the tips from a recent kill.
- **Key Event:** The Assessment.
- **Detailed Description:** It lowers its head, shoulder blades protruding as it stalks. It is hunting. And she is the prey.
- **Key Event:** The Weapon Check.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica reaches for her holster. It's empty. Her sidearm is gone, lost in the crash or the tumble. She curses silently.
- **Key Event:** The Inventory.
- **Detailed Description:** She frantically checks her pockets. A multi-tool. A dead flare. She bends down and scrabbles in the dirt, her fingers closing around a jagged shard of titanium alloy she pulled from the wreckage. It is sharp, but against 400 pounds of killing machine, it looks pathetic.

### Scene 4: The Joke

- **Key Event:** The Standoff.
- **Detailed Description:** The cat crouches, muscles bunching in its hind legs. Its tail flicks—once, twice. The universal sign of an imminent strike.
- **Key Event:** The Absurdity.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica starts to laugh. It isn't a happy sound. It bubbles up from her diaphragm—a hysterical, oxygen-drunk release of tension.
- **Key Event:** The Logic.
- **Detailed Description:** She stands up straight, dropping the defensive crouch.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Really? I survived the Fall of the Zenith. I survived the Stone Season. I survived Vane and his army of zealots. And this is how it ends? I'm high-protein cat food?"
- **Key Event:** The Confusion.
- **Detailed Description:** The cat pauses. Its ears twitch. Prey doesn't laugh. Prey runs. Prey screams. This behavior does not fit the pattern. It hesitates, its predatory programming encountering a glitch.
- **Key Event:** The Shift.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stops laughing. The hysteria vanishes as quickly as it came, replaced by a cold, hard resolve. Her face goes stone still.
- **Key Event:** The Preparation.
- **Detailed Description:** She grips the titanium shard in a reverse grip. She wraps her heavy leather flight jacket around her left arm—a makeshift shield.
- **Key Event:** The Challenge.
- **Detailed Description:** She bares her teeth in a primal snarl that mimics the cat's own expression.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You want me? Come and get me."
- **Key Event:** The Advance.
- **Detailed Description:** She steps _toward_ the cat. It is a violation of nature's laws.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The history books said this era was 'lush.' They meant 'deadly.' But I'm from the sky, kitty. I'm deadlier than I look. Come on. Let's see who bites harder."
- **Key Event:** The Retreat.
- **Detailed Description:** The cat hisses, spitting. It is unsure now. The prey is aggressive. The prey has titanium claws and smells of ozone and fire. It backs away, preserving its energy for an easier meal. It snarls one last time, a face-saving gesture, then turns and vanishes into the brush like smoke.
- **Key Event:** The Aftermath.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands there for a full minute, adrenaline shaking her hands. She lowers the shard. She takes a breath of the rich, heavy air.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Breathless) "I won. For now."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She proves that her survival instinct overrides fear, allowing her to adapt and dominate even in an alien ecosystem.
