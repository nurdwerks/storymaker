## Chapter 23: The Doubt

### Scene 1: The Storm / The Valley

- **Key Event:** The sky turns a bruised purple.
- **Key Event:** The wind stops. The jungle goes silent. The birds stop singing.
- **Key Event:** "Hyper-Cane," Angelica says, reading the barometer. "Pressure is dropping off the scale."
- **Key Event:** It hits. A wall of wind moving at 300 kph.
- **Key Event:** Trees are snapped like matchsticks. The roof of the Longhouse is ripped off and vanishes into the clouds.
- **Key Event:** The tribe huddles in the caves.
- **Key Event:** "It is the anger of the Sky!" a warrior screams. "We have offended the spirits with the Metal Mountain!"
- **Key Event:** He points to the _Aeterna_, sitting in its scaffolding. The wind howls through its exposed ribs.
- **Key Event:** "Tear it down!" someone shouts. "Appease the wind!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands at the cave mouth. "No!"
- **Key Event:** "It is hubris!" the warrior yells. "Hubris incarnate!"
- **Key Event:** "It is structure!" Angelica yells back. "It is aerodynamics! It will hold! I did the math!"

### Scene 2: The Fear / Under the Hull

- **Key Event:** Angelica runs out into the storm.
- **Key Event:** "Angelica!" Torin chases her.
- **Key Event:** She reaches the ship. She checks the anchor cables. They are singing, vibrating with tension.
- **Key Event:** One cable snaps. _WHIP._ It slices through a tree trunk.
- **Key Event:** Torin flinches. He grabs Angelica's arm.
- **Key Event:** "We have to leave it! It's going to fall!"
- **Key Event:** "No!" Angelica clings to a strut. "If I let go, it falls. I have to tighten the tensioner!"
- **Key Event:** She climbs the shaking scaffolding. The wind tries to peel her off.
- **Key Event:** she reaches the winch. She cranks it.
- **Key Event:** Torin watches her. He is terrified. Not for the ship, but for her.
- **Key Event:** He climbs up. He puts his hands over hers.
- **Key Event:** Together, they turn the crank. The cable tightens. The ship stabilizes.

### Scene 3: The Comfort / Under the Hull

- **Key Event:** They slide down to the shelter of the landing gear.
- **Key Event:** The storm rages around them. Inside the wheel well, it is relatively quiet.
- **Key Event:** They are soaked, shivering.
- **Key Event:** Torin holds her.
- **Key Event:** "You are crazy," he breathes into her hair.
- **Key Event:** "I'm an engineer," she chatters. "Same thing."
- **Key Event:** They sit in the dark.
- **Key Event:** "Why do you fight the wind?" Torin asks. "It is stronger than you."
- **Key Event:** "Gravity is a law," Angelica says. "Thermodynamics is a law. But humans... we're lawyers."
- **Key Event:** Torin frowns. "Lawyers?"
- **Key Event:** "We find loopholes," she says. "We cheat, Torin. That is what humans do. We cheat the wind. We cheat the dark. We cheat death."
- **Key Event:** She rests her head on his shoulder. "And right now, I'm cheating the cold."

### Scene 4: The Shield Breaks / The Lead Box (Reactor Room)

- **Key Event:** While the storm rages outside, something is happening inside the ship.
- **Key Event:** In the reactor room, the lead box containing Vane's crystal is vibrating.
- **Key Event:** The storm's static charge is feeding it. Overloading the containment.
- **Key Event:** The lid rattles.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar enters the room. He is checking the seals.
- **Key Event:** He hears a voice. **"Ragnar."**
- **Key Event:** He approaches the box. "Who speaks?"
- **Key Event:** **"Power,"** the voice says. **"Unlimited power for the Alpha."**
- **Key Event:** Ragnar touches the box.
- **Key Event:** A spark jumps. Violet lightning.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar stiffens. His eyes roll back.
- **Key Event:** When he opens them, they are not Ragnar's eyes. They are cold. Calculative.
- **Key Event:** Vane has found a Vessel.

### Scene 5: The Sacrifice / The Cave

- **Key Event:** Ragnar (Vane) walks back to the cave.
- **Key Event:** He finds Astrid, a young healer who suggested they stop building to focus on food.
- **Key Event:** "The storm is a sign," Astrid says to the cowering elders. "We should trade the iron. Buy peace."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar steps forward.
- **Key Event:** "Peace is for the dead," he says. His voice is different. Smoother.
- **Key Event:** He grabs Astrid by the throat.
- **Key Event:** He lifts her one-handed.
- **Key Event:** "You are a variable," he says. "And you have been subtracted."
- **Key Event:** He snaps her neck.
- **Key Event:** The tribe screams.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar drops the body.
- **Key Event:** "Loyalty is a flaw," he tells them. "Obedience is survival. Back to work."
- **Key Event:** He walks out into the storm. The wind doesn't seem to touch him.
