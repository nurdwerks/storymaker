## Chapter 25: The Tower Climb

### Scene 1: The Stairs / Emergency Stairwell, Broadcast Tower

- **Key Event:** The emergency stairwell of the Zenith Broadcast Tower is a vertical coffin of grey concrete. It smells of dead air and industrial sealant. There are one hundred floors between the lobby and the transmitter. No elevators. The lockdown has sealed them.
- **Key Event:** They are on Floor 60. The climb has become a blur of agony.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is in the lead. Her lungs are burning, a dry fire in her chest. Her legs feel like they don't belong to her anymore; they are just heavy pistons lifting and dropping.
- **Key Event:** Behind her, the team is struggling. Lisbet is hyperventilating, her small frame not built for endurance. Hatcher is wheezing, his old lungs rattling like a broken fan.
- **Key Event:** But it's Zephyr who is dying.
- **Key Event:** The Rogue is stumbling. His cybernetic arm, usually a masterpiece of silent precision, is grinding. _Whirrr-click. Whirrr-click._ A sound like a dying clock.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stops. She grabs the railing, her gloves slipping on the condensation. She looks back.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr is leaning against the wall. His skin is the color of wet ash. His sweat is cold. He looks up at her, and for the first time, his smirk is gone.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She sees the numbers on his wrist. The red digital counter that rules his life. **[000,050]**. Fifty credits. That's not a bank account anymore. That's a heartbeat count.
- **Key Event:** She goes back down two steps. She grabs his good arm.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She becomes the physical and emotional anchor for the group, literally dragging her teammates upward through her own extreme exhaustion. She refuses to leave anyone behind, a stark contrast to the Zenith's "survival of the fittest" philosophy.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Move your feet, Zephyr. That's an order."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** _(Gasps)_ "Price of admission... just went up, Princess. Surge pricing."

### Scene 2: The Fatigue / Floor 80, Broadcast Tower

- **Key Event:** Floor 80. The air is thinner here. The sounds of the city below are gone, replaced by the howling of the wind against the tower's outer shell.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr collapses. He doesn't fall gracefully. He just folds, his knees hitting the concrete with a bone-jarring crack.
- **Key Event:** He rolls onto his back. He is gasping, clutching his chest. The number on his wrist flicks: **[000,010]**. Ten credits.
- **Key Event:** His cybernetic eye flickers and goes dark. His arm locks up, dead weight dragging his shoulder down.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher kneels beside him, checking his pulse. He shakes his head. "He's empty, kid. The Bond is eating his organs to keep the lights on."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr waves a weak hand. "Go. The Wardens... they're five floors down. I can hear them."
- **Key Event:** He pulls his blaster—the heavy custom heavy-pistol not seeing much use lately—from his holster. His hand shakes, but he grips it.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Zephyr):** This is it. The big cash-out. He always thought he'd die on a pile of money, surrounded by expensive things. Instead, he's dying on a dirty staircase with ten credits to his name. And the funny thing? He doesn't mind. He looks at Angelica. _Worth it._
- **Key Event:** He looks at Angelica. His eyes are clear.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He abandons his self-preservation instincts for the first time, choosing a martyr's end to ensure the mission's success. He stops calculating the cost and pays the bill.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Finish the mission. I'll hold the door. I'm just luggage now."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "You are not luggage. You are myQuartermaster."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I'm broke, Princess. Engine's dead. No fuel. Leave me."

### Scene 3: The Gift / Floor 80

- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at him. She looks at the door to the roof, twenty floors up. Then she looks at the bag slung over her shoulder.
- **Key Event:** She feels the weight of it. The _Cylinder of Truth_. The ancient artifact she stole from the Museum. The object the entire war is about.
- **Key Event:** She opens the bag. The golden light spills out, illuminating the grim stairwell.
- **Key Event:** It is a casing of pure, ancient gold. Intricate engravings. Priceless. It is worth more than the tower they are standing in.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet gasps. "Angelica, that's the payload. That's the proof."
- **Key Event:** Angelica ignores her. She pulls the casing off the Cylinder. She holds the heavy, golden shell in her hands. It is warm.
- **Key Event:** She kneels in front of Zephyr. She presses the gold into his flesh-and-blood hand.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr stares at it. His scanners instinctively appraise it. **[VALUE: ERROR. INFINITE.]**
- **Key Event:** He looks up at her, confused. "Princess?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica closes his fingers around it.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She sacrifices a literal fortune to save her friend’s life, demonstrating her primary loyalty to her team over material wealth. She rejects the Zenith's value system completely.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Buy your life back, Zephyr. Pay off your interest. Be a free man."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "This is... millions. This is a kingdom."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "It's just metal. You're the asset."

### Scene 4: The Resolution / Floors 80-100

- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks at the gold. Then he looks at his arm.
- **Key Event:** He jams the golden casing directly into the "Ingest" port on his cybernetic elbow. The port grinds, widening to accept the massive offering.
- **Key Event:** The machine _screams_.
- **Key Event:** It isn't a mechanical sound. It is a roar of digital ecstasy. The gold dissolves instantly, atomized by the Bond.
- **Key Event:** The counter on Zephyr's wrist blurs. It doesn't just go up. It spins so fast it becomes a solid line of red. **[999,999...]** ERROR. OVERFLOW.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr arches his back. His cybernetic eye explodes with light—not blue, but blinding, burning _Platinum_.
- **Key Event:** Steam vents from his shoulders. His skin flushes with health. The grey death is gone, replaced by the terrifying vitality of a god fueled by infinite capital.
- **Key Event:** He stands up. He doesn't struggle. He levitates for a second, raw power pushing against gravity.
- **Key Event:** He looks at his hand. The fingers flex, and the air ripples with the force of the servos engaging.
- **Key Event:** He looks at the door above them. The blast door that requires a tank to open.
- **Key Event:** He grins. It is the grin of a man who just bought the bank.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Rejuvenated by the raw power of the converted gold, he embraces his role as the team’s "avenging angel" with renewed ferocity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** _(Voice distorted by power)_ "Well. Seeing as I'm flush..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Can you walk?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Walk? Princess, I can fly. Let's go punch god in the face."
