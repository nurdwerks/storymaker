### Scene 1: The Reveal (The Cursed Box)

- **Key Event:** Angelica presents the Vane-trap crystal to the senior staff in the Zenith's war room.
- **Detailed Description:** The mood in the war room is grim. The tactical map shows the enemy fleet regrouping for a final assault. Angelica places a heavy, lead-lined box on the central table. The metal thuds against the surface with a sound of finality. She unlocks the bio-seals with her thumbprint. The lid hisses open, releasing a faint smell of ozone. Inside, resting on a bed of dampening foam, is the quartz crystal. It has changed since she trapped Vane in it. It is no longer clear; it is a deep, swirling crimson. The light inside pulses with a rhythmic, sickly beat, like an infected heart. Faint, distorted faces press against the inner facets of the gem—the digital screams of Prelate Vane.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a wave of nausea. This object is an abomination. It contains the soul of a monster and the radioactive byproduct of a time jump. It feels greasy to the psychic touch. She hates that she has to use it. She hates that Vane, even in defeat, is still necessary.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "This isn't just a battery. It's a prison. Vane is in there. And he's been stewing in his own hate for twenty years."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He looks... angry. It's pulsing like it wants to get out."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Good. Anger is explosive. We're going to use it."

### Scene 2: The Analysis (The Singularity)

- **Key Event:** Lisbet scans the crystal and realizes its true nature.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet approaches the box cautiously. She extends a sensor wand. The moment the sensor touches the crystal's aura, her datapad shrieks with feedback and sparks. She drops the pad. She pulls out a manual Geiger counter. The needle slams against the maximum reading. She looks at Angelica, her eyes wide with professional terror. The crystal isn't just storing energy; it's compressing it. It is emitting Hawking radiation.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet does the math in her head. The energy density inside that crystal violates the laws of physics. It is essentially a microscopic black hole held together by magic and hate. If the containment fails, it won't just blow a hole in the ship; it will crack the planet's crust. She realizes they are holding the end of the world in a box.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She confirms the danger with professional awe, realizing the scale of the weapon they are holding.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Angelica, this is off the charts. This isn't just power. It's a singularity in a bottle. If you crack this, it's not just an explosion. It's a supernova. We're holding a dead star."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Can we aim it?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "You don't aim a supernova, General. You drop it and run. Fast."

### Scene 3: The Plan (The Suicide Run)

- **Key Event:** Angelica outlines the delivery method.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica brings up the schematic of the enemy flagship. It is a massive, organic-looking vessel. She points to a ventilation port near the main engine cluster. "We can't fire it from a cannon," she explains. "The acceleration would destabilize the crystal. It has to be flown in. Gently. Until the last second." She looks around the table. "I need a pilot who can fly through a solid wall of flak, breach the shield, and drop this into the reactor core. Manually."
- **Internal Conflict:** Silence descends on the room. Everyone knows what she is asking. It is a one-way trip. Angelica feels the weight of the command. She is asking one of her friends to die. She looks at Zephyr. She knows he is the only one who can do it. She feels sick with guilt, but she pushes it down. The mission comes first.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I can't order anyone to do this. But I have to ask."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Tell Vane he finally gets to change the future. He gets to end it."

### Scene 4: The Volunteer (The Debtor's Release)

- **Key Event:** Zephyr volunteers immediately.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr steps forward from the back of the room. He is flipping his lucky coin. He catches it, snaps his fist shut, and grins. His gold tooth flashes in the harsh light. He doesn't look resigned; he looks relieved. He picks up the crystal with a pair of tongs, whistling a low tune. He handles the apocalypse like it's a stolen diamond.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr feels a strange lightness. For his entire life, he has been running from debt. He has been defined by what he owes—to Gilded, to the universe, to his own survival instinct. This mission clears the ledger. It is the ultimate payment. He isn't dying; he is buying his freedom.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He accepts a certain death sentence with fatalistic humor and bravery. He transforms his greed into sacrifice—paying the ultimate price for his friends.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Consider it delivered. Express shipping. Do I get a tip?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You get to be a legend, Zephyr. They'll name the stars after you."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I'll take it. Better than being rich. Make sure you get the view from the cheap seats."

- **Key Event:** The Departure.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr walks out of the room with the box. He doesn't look back. The door slides shut. Angelica stares at the empty space where he stood. She whispers a goodbye that no one hears. She knows she will never see him again. The cost of victory is rising.
