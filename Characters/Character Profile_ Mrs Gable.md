# Character Profile: Mrs. Gable

**Archetype:** The Fragile Citizen / The Weaponized Victim
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Choosing comfortable ignorance over the reality of the violence around her).
**Virtue Mask:** INNOCENCE (She frames her fear as "Protecting Peaceful Society").

## I. Role in the Story

Mrs. Gable is a sweet-faced old woman who knits alongside Joyce in the retirement home. She is the "perfect" cover for an assassin.

- **The Tactic:** Whenever Angelica enters, Mrs. Gable clutches her purse and looks at her with wide, fearful eyes.
- **The Label:** This reaction prompts Joyce to "protect" her friend from the "scary silt-girl," reinforcing the idea that Angelica is a monster whose mere presence is a threat to peaceful citizens.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Violent Awakening / False Flag. During a peaceful demonstration at the retirement home, Mrs. Gable is "accidentally" killed by a Silt-side protester (who was actually an operative hired by the Zenith to discredit the resistance).
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce’s "fragile grandmother" mask shattered. Her grief turns into a cold, focused rage. She stops being a retired citizen and starts being an active assassin again, hunting down the "Silt-scum" she blames for her friend’s death.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Peaceful Society" is revealed as a lie. The remaining residents of the home are terrified, turning the sewing circle into a group of grieving, paranoid elders who now view everyone from the Silt as a potential murderer.

## III. Book 4 Integration

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 22
- **Scene:** "The Protest" (The False Flag)
- **Role:** The Innocent Victim
- **Quote:** "Oh dear. They sound upset. Someone should talk to them."

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | The parlor is warm and cozy, filled with overstuffed armchairs and shelves of real books. A fire—holographic but convincing—crackles in the hearth. Around a low table, a group of elderly residents sit, sipping tea and working on various crafts. There is Mr. Henderson, a man with shaking hands and a hearing aid; Mrs. Gable, who is dozing off; and others. They smile and nod at the newcomers. The survivors are given porcelain cups of Earl Grey tea and plates of synthetic biscuits. The juxtaposition of their combat armor and the delicate china is absurd. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | *Internal Conflict | Dr. Aris scans the room, his eyes narrowing. He notices details that others miss. The way Mr. Henderson holds his teacup—with a grip strength that belies his tremors. The way Mrs. Gable's "nap" allows her to watch the door through slitted eyes. The "knitting needles" that are sharpened to a monofilament point. He realizes this is not a retirement home; it is a sanctuary for retired monsters. These are the elite of the criminal underworld, the ones who survived long enough to grow old. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 21 | Detailed Description | Henderson stands up to get more sugar, his "frail" movements exaggerated. He bumps into a side table, knocking over Joyce’s large knitting bag. It hits the floor with a heavy, metallic _clank_ that no yarn should make. The contents spill out across the Persian rug. Instead of wool, out rolls a jagged combat knife, a handful of high-yield flash-bang grenades, and a compact sub-machine gun with the serial numbers filed off. The silence in the room is absolute. The "seniors" stop their activities instantly. Mrs. Gable's eyes snap open, clear and cold. Henderson straightens up, his tremors vanishing, his posture shifting into a combat crouch. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | The lights of the Gentle Rest, usually hidden, were exposed during the previous night's altercation. Now, a mob of survivors from the surrounding ruins has gathered at the gates. They are starving, desperate, and angry. They see the warmth and light inside as a hoard that is being denied to them. They shout, throw rocks, and pound on the reinforced glass. Among them are agitators from "Torque's" gang, using the mob as cover to probe the defenses. Inside, the residents watch with fear. Mrs. Gable presses her hand to the glass, weeping for the "poor people." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce watches from the foyer. She knows what is coming. She knows that kindness is a death sentence in this world. She tries to pull Mrs. Gable away, but it is too late. A single shot rings out—a "False Flag" sniper round from Torque’s men. It shatters the glass and hits Mrs. Gable in the chest. She falls, her knitting bag spilling onto the floor. The sight of blood sends the mob into a frenzy. They surge forward, breaking down the doors. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Gable, get away from the glass! They don't want your pity, they want your food! Get back!" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Mrs. Gable:** "But look at them, Joyce. They're so hungry..." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce is broken. She has lost her home, her friend Gable, her protector Timmy, and her illusion of peace. She is just a killer in the dark again. She looks at her hands, still stained with blood, and weeps silently. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Can't he? Words started this war. Words killed Gable." |
