# Character Profile: Sir Gallant

**Archetype:** The Suitor / The Shield
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views his proximity to Corinne as a trophy rather than a relationship).
**Virtue Mask:** CHIVALRY (He plays the part of the romantic protector to hide his own vanity).

## I. Role in the Story

Sir Gallant is a young, handsome suitor who currently holds the position of "Flavor of the Month" in Corinne's court. He provides the uncomplicated adoration that Corinne craves to maintain her self-image.

- **The Dynamic:** His presence serves as a painful contrast for Angelica, highlighting the unconditional support and admiration she lacks.
- **The Neglect:** He treats Angelica as part of the scenery, effectively erasing her presence in any room Corinne occupies. By ignoring her entirely, he reinforces her isolation from the Zenith's social elite.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Betrayal of Valor. When a true threat emerges—a Silt-side assassin targeting Corinne—Sir Gallant freezes in fear. He realizes his "chivalry" was a hollow performance, and he cowers while Angelica (or another) intervenes.
- **Impact on Lady Corinne:** Corinne is humiliated by his cowardice. She publicly strips him of his "Flavor of the Month" status, turning him into a social pariah whose name is never spoken again.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The court quickly finds a new "champion," demonstrating how easily "icons" are discarded when they fail to maintain the illusion of the court's superiority.

## III. Narrative Integration

- **Event Location:** [Book 4, Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%204_%20The%20Stone%20Season%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L633-L634)
- **Defining Quote from Lady Corinne:** "You were supposed to be the shield, Gallant. Not the one hiding behind me. A knight who fears the dark isn't a knight—he's just a boy in expensive metal. I have no use for boys who can't keep their hands steady."

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 04 | Detailed Description | The dining hall is suffocatingly warm, the air thick with the smell of roasted meat and heavy perfume. Angelica pushes her plate away, her face pale. She whispers an apology to the Duke, claiming the richness of the food has unsettled her. Grey, annoyed but maintaining his gallant facade, waves a hand of dismissal. Angelica walks out of the hall, her heels clicking on the marble. As soon as the heavy doors close behind her, her posture changes. The fragility vanishes. She moves with the silent, stalking grace of an Undercity scavenger. She slips off her heels, carrying them. She moves down the corridor, avoiding the patrolling automated sentries by timing their rotation cycles. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | *The Vanity Court | Surrounding **Lady Corinne** is her retinue: **Marcel** (her stylus-wielding fashion stylist who critiques everyone's hemline), the twins **Rose and Lily** (who brush her hair in unison), and **Photographer Vorn** (who orbits her like a moon, snapping photos for the social feed). **Sir Gallant**, her current suitor, hovers nearby, fetching her drinks with pathetic eagerness. |
