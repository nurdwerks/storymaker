# Character Profile: "Little" Timmy

**Archetype:** The Protector / The Unthinking Wall
**True Sin:** WRATH (His protection is unthinking and absolute, easily turned into physical aggression).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (He frames his blocking and intimidation as "Respect for Elders").

## I. Role in the Story

"Little" Timmy is a massive, simple-minded orderly at the retirement home who adores Joyce and acts as her "unofficial" bodyguard.

- **The Barrier:** He physically blocks Angelica’s path, crossing his arms and saying, "Miss Joyce is resting. Go away."
- **The Devotion:** His unthinking loyalty to the "harmless grandmother" version of Joyce makes Angelica feel like a villain for even trying to speak to her own grandmother.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Honorable Sacrifice / Maiming. During an assassination attempt on Joyce, Timmy takes a bullet (or energy blast) meant for her. He survives, but he is permanently paralyzed, losing the physical strength that was his only defining trait.
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce feels a deep, agonizing guilt. She realizes that her "secret" life has destroyed the life of a simple, innocent man who only wanted to protect her. She becomes more ruthless in her pursuit of the Zenith, viewing it as "justice" for Timmy.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Wall" is broken. The retirement home no longer feels safe. The other residents lose their protector and become increasingly dependent on "Nurse" Ratched's clinical authority for their safety.

## III. Book 4 Integration

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 22
- **Scene:** "The Sacrifice" (Paralyzed protecting Joyce)
- **Role:** The Unbreakable Wall
- **Quote:** "Legs... don't work. Did I stop them, Miss Joyce?"
