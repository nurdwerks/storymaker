### Scene 1: Engineering Deck

- **Key Event:** Lisbet jacks directly into a terminal to restore power, receiving a violent electric shock but successfully awakening the ship's systems and AI.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Displays a high tolerance for pain and a deep connection to technology, enjoying the "raw" voltage of the ancient ship.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "The voltage is raw. No regulators. It kicks like a mule. It tastes like... aluminum."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **AI:** "Life Support at 12%. Atmospheric scrubbers engaged. Gravity localized. Welcome back, Crew."

- **Key Event:** The ship's AI detects a recursive deep space signal directed at the Zenith, and the ship automatically enters "Silent Running" mode.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Decides to prioritize caution and stealth, refusing to override the ship's hiding protocols until they know who is looking.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "The ship isn't dead. It's just holding its breath. And it's terrified."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "We're the rats in the walls. And something is hunting the house."
