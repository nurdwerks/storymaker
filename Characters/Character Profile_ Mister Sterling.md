## I. Role in the Story

Mister Sterling is Baron Gilded's personal appraiser and accountant. Equipped with cybernetic monocles that scan for value, he is the man who translates the Baron's gluttony into cold numbers.

- **The Interaction:** He treats people like currency or counterfeit coins. He frequently remarks on Angelica’s "low-grade material" within earshot, Reinforcing her status as a commodity rather than a person.
- **The Bond:** He and Gilded share private jokes about the "price of life," laughing at the desperation of those trapped in the Baron's debt.
