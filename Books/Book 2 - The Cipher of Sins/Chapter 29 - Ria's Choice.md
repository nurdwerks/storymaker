## Chapter 29: Ria's Choice

### Scene 1: The View

- **Key Event:** The location is Street Level, Sector 4. The "Protocol: Silence" order is in full effect. Wardens are sweeping the streets, executing anyone breaking curfew.
- **Key Event:** Officer 884 (Ria) is on patrol. She is mounted on her black kinetic-interceptor bike. Her HUD is streaming tactical data: _Target Identification. Threat Assessment. Compliance Enforcement._
- **Key Event:** She watches a squad of Wardens corner a group of civilians near a food dispenser. One of the civilians is a young girl, no older than ten, clutching a dirty, mechanical toy robot.
- **Key Event:** The Squad Leader, Officer 772, raises his riot-baton. The girl is crying. She isn't a threat. She is just small.
- **Key Event:** Officer 772 strikes the girl. The sound of the impact—metal on bone—cuts through the noise of the riot. The girl falls. The toy robot clatters across the pavement, one of its plastic arms snapping off.
- **Key Event:** Something inside Officer 884 snaps along with it. A red warning box flashes on her HUD: _EMOTIONAL SPIKE DETECTED. ADMINISTER SUPPRESSANTS._
- **Key Event:** She ignores the prompt. She stares at the broken toy. The image overlays with a memory file she thought was deleted.
  - **Memory Playback:** _She is five years old. She is holding a similar robot. A Warden is standing over her. Not to hit her, but to shield her from falling debris. The Warden's armor was scratched, dirty, human._
- **Key Event:** The contrast between that memory and the reality of Officer 772 raising his baton for a second strike creates a "Logic Error" that crashes her conditioning. The "Protector" protocol overwrites the "Obedience" protocol.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Her deep-seated conditioning as a "Protector of the Peace" finally shatters when faced with the undeniable reality that the Wardens have become the monsters they were built to fight. The Cognitive Dissonance breaks, replaced by clarity.

### Scene 2: The Snap

- **Key Event:** Time seems to slow down. The "Grey" filter of her neural inhibitors lifts. The world explodes into color. The red of the girl's blood. The blue of the neon signs. The white of the riot lights.
- **Key Event:** Memories rush back. Not the programmed memories of the Academy, but the real ones. The smell of ozone. The feeling of being small and scared. The taste of synthetic rations shared with a brother she can't quite name yet.
- **Key Event:** She realizes the lie. The Warden Corps isn't a shield; it's a hammer. And she is the arm swinging it. She looks at her own hands, encased in the same white armor as the brute hitting the child. She feels sick.
- **Key Event:** The Squad Leader raises his baton for a killing blow. The girl curls into a ball, waiting for the end.
- **Key Event:** Officer 884 revs her engine. The sound is a roar, a mechanical scream of defiance that momentarily drowns out the sirens.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She makes a conscious choice to reject her identity as "Officer 884." She chooses to be a "Glitch." She chooses to be the wrench in the gears.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **System Voice:** "Warning. Deviant behavior detected. Report to reconditioning immediately. Compliance is mandatory."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Not an error. A correction. System... offline."

### Scene 3: The Turn

- **Key Event:** Ria drops the clutch. The interceptor launches forward.
- **Key Event:** She doesn't fire her weapons. She uses the bike itself. She rams into Officer 772 at sixty miles per hour.
- **Key Event:** The impact sends him flying through a storefront window. His armor crumples. He doesn't get up.
- **Key Event:** The other Wardens freeze. This is unprecedented. _Blue-on-Blue._
- **Key Event:** Ria skids to a halt between the squad and the girl. She kicks the stand down.
- **Key Event:** She reaches up and unlatches her helmet. The pressurized hiss of the seal breaking is the sound of her freedom.
- **Key Event:** She takes the helmet off and drops it. It shatters on the pavement. She reveals her face—her scars, her eyes, her humanity.
- **Key Event:** She draws her mono-molecular blade. It hums with blue energy.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She publicly identifies herself. She is no longer a number. She is a traitor, and she is proud of it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I am not 884. I am Ria. And I am defending this child. Any of you want to try and go through me?"

### Scene 4: The Riot

- **Key Event:** The civilians are watching. They have never seen a Warden punish one of their own.
- **Key Event:** The fear in the crowd turns to something else. Hope. Then rage.
- **Key Event:** Someone throws a bottle. Then a stone. Then a molotov cocktail.
- **Key Event:** The remaining Wardens open fire, but Ria is a whirlwind. She deflects plasma bolts with her blade. She moves with the speed of an enhanced super-soldier.
- **Key Event:** She cuts the rifles in half not to kill, but to disarm. She is methodically dismantling the squad.
- **Key Event:** Seeing her fight, the Undercity gangs swarm out of the alleys. They have pipes and chains. They join the line.
- **Key Event:** Ria finds herself at the center of a roaring phalanx of the oppressed. She raises her sword.
- **Key Event:** The riot turns into a revolution. The Wardens retreat, overwhelmed by the sheer ferocity of the counter-attack.
- **Key Event:** Ria looks down at the little girl. She picks up the toy robot and hands it back. Her metal gauntlet is gentle.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She embraces the role of "The Iron Vanguard." She isn't a hero; she's just the one who got pissed off first.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Go home, kid. We've got some trash to take out."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (to the crowd):** "Who wants to break something?"
