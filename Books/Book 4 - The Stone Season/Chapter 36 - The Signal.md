# Chapter 36: The Signal

---

### Scene 1: The Broadcast

- **Key Event:** Using the high-gain antenna on the Observation Deck, Angelica broadcasts a wide-spectrum signal, hoping to find any other ships in the fleet.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "This is The Ark. Is there anyone out there? Does anyone remember the way home?"

---

### Scene 2: The Response

- **Key Event:** A response comes through, but it is not human; it is an automated "Containment Drone" signal from a nearby orbital platform.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Identifies the signal as a "Vane-Protocol" remnant, meaning Vane's ancestors may have been the ones who quarantined the ship in the first place.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "The signal is an echo of the quarantine. We weren't lost; we were locked away. Vane didn't start the infection; he just inherited the cage."

### Scene 3: The Threat

- **Key Event:** The drone platform begins a "Sterilization Sequence," targeting the Observation Deck with a high-energy pulse.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "The sky is firing back! Move! Into the maintenance crawlspace!"

### Scene 4: The Jamming

- **Key Event:** Angelica uses the Mother's dormant neural-link to "pulse" the drone’s sensors, tricking it into thinking the ship is a dead rock.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Successfully manipulates the "residual horror" of the Mother to weaponize it against the drones.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You want a dead ship? I'll give you a ghost. I'll make us look like the void itself."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "She's weaving the shadows into the signal. It's beautiful... in a terrifying way."
