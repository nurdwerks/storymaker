## Chapter 19: The Trial

### Scene 0: The Whisper

- **Key Event:** Lady Vesper incites the riot.
- **Detailed Description:** Hours before the riot, **Lady Vesper** (disguised in drab grey rags) walks through the water filtration sector. She stops by a group of grieving mothers. She doesn't shout; she whispers. She drops a piece of data—a fabricated log showing Aris's "deliberate" failure rate. She hands it to Mara's sister.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Vesper:** "Accidents happen. But calculation? That's murder. If you don't stop him, he'll test the next one on your daughter."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Vesper** — She acts as an agent of chaos, using the grief of the survivors to destabilize Angelica's coalition without ever showing her true face.

### Scene 1: The Mob

- **Key Event:** The location is the Central Plaza of the Survivor Camp, a repurposed water filtration chamber. The atmosphere is toxic with rage.
- **Key Event:** A mob of thirty survivors, the "Stone Eaters," has dragged Dr. Aris out of his makeshift lab. They occupy the high ground, surrounding him on the metal gantries.
- **Key Event:** The catalyst for the riot is the death of Pip, a young scavenger who volunteered to test Aris's new fungal-filtration mask. The mask failed, and Pip suffocated on spore-choked air.
- **Key Event:** Mara, Pip's aunt and the informal leader of the civilian faction, holds a length of heavy pipe. She is screaming for blood.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Mara:** "He didn't treat him! He took notes while the boy choked! He watched him turn blue and checked his stopwatch!"
- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris is on his knees in the center of the circle. He is not begging. He is frantically typing on his datapad, calculating escape vectors.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — He looks up at Mara, genuinely confused by her anger. He doesn't see a tragedy; he sees a dataset. "The failure provided critical data, Mara. The next prototype will have a 94% success rate. Pip's contribution was... efficient."
- **Key Event:** This comment effectively lights the fuse. The mob surges forward. Stones and scrap metal rattle against the plating around Aris. One strikes his shoulder, knocking the datapad from his hand.

### Scene 2: The Defense

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward intervenes before the first blow lands. She doesn't walk into the circle; she _shifts_ into it, using a micro-burst of speed provided by her bond, Aeon.
- **Key Event:** She stands between Aris and the mob. She is not armed with a gun, but the air around her ripples with temporal distortion. The "Clockwork Gryphon" remains invisible but palpable, a pressure on the ears.
- **Key Event:** Angelica raises a hand. Her voice is amplified, the "Command Voice" echoing off the metal walls.
- **Key Event:** She acknowledges the anger. She doesn't dismiss Pip's death. But she reframes the narrative from "Murder" to "Resource Management."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She looks at the hungry, desperate faces of the survivors. She knows they don't care about justice; they care about survival. She decides to use fear and logic.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Kill him. Go ahead. Smash his head in. And when the water recycler breaks next week, who fixes it? You, Mara? Can you calibrate a reverse-osmosis membrane?"
- **Key Event:** The mob hesitates. The threat of thirst is more potent than the desire for revenge.
- **Key Event:** Angelica presses the advantage. She points to Aris, who is rubbing his bruised shoulder.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He is a monster. I know that. He has no heart. But he has a brain. And right now, his brain is the only thing standing between us and dehydration. We need his hands. We need his math. We wander in the dark until we starve without him."

### Scene 3: The Verdict

- **Key Event:** Mara spits on the ground but lowers the pipe. She demands a price. "Blood for blood."
- **Key Event:** Angelica nods. She turns to Aris. She grabs him by the collar of his lab coat and hauls him to his feet.
- **Key Event:** She declares the verdict to the crowd. Aris is found "Guilty of Malpractice and Negligence."
- **Key Event:** The sentence is not death. It is "Indenture."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He is no longer a citizen of this camp. He is property. He is a tool in the colony's inventory. He works eighteen hours a day. He eats last. He sleeps on the floor. If he refuses a task, he doesn't eat. If he endangers another life, I will execute him myself."
- **Key Event:** The crowd murmurs, satisfied. Stripping the arrogant scientist of his status and humanity appeals to their envy.
- **Key Event:** Angelica leans in close to Aris, whispering so only he can hear. Her eyes are cold, the "Humility" mask completely gone.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She terrorizes him. She needs him to know that she is the one holding the leash.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If you treat one more person as a variable... I will kill you myself. Not as a judge. As an executioner. Do you understand? I will unmake you."
- **Key Event:** Aris stares at her. He sees the temporal energy arcing in her iris. He nods.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Understood. The parameters are clear. Survival is the priority. I accept the... reconfiguration of my status."

### Scene 4: The Result

- **Key Event:** The mob disperses efficiently, their bloodlust sated by the social demotion of the Doctor. They return to their hovels.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is left standing alone in the plaza with Ria, who had been watching from the shadows with her rifle, ready to intervene if the speech failed.
- **Key Event:** Ria approaches, looking at Angelica with a mix of respect and disgust.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "That was cold, Ward. You sold him. You saved his neck, but you sold him."
- **Key Event:** Angelica wipes sweat from her brow. She is shaking slightly—the adrenaline dump of facing down a mob.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I didn't sell him, Ria. I secured an asset. We need the recycler fixed."
- **Key Event:** Ria spits on the spot where Aris was kneeling.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're becoming one of them. You're becoming Vane. Just moving pieces on a board. Careful you don't forget which ones are people."
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches Ria walk away. She looks at her own hands. They are steady.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She accepts the burden. If being a monster is what it takes to keep them alive, she will wear the monster's face.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I need his brain. I don't need his soul to fix the pipes."
