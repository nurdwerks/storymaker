## Chapter 17: The Tea

### Scene 1: The Comfort

- **Key Event:** The safehouse is located in the backrooms of "Joyce’s Floral Arrangements" in Sector 4. The contrast between the industrial grime of the Undercity and this parlor is jarring. There are doilies, flowered wallpaper, and the smell of lavender.
- **Key Event:** The team is exhausted. Zephyr is asleep on a chintz sofa, his brass arm hanging off the side. Hatcher is cleaning his rifle at the kitchen table, looking out of place among the porcelain figurines.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sits by the window, watching the street through the blinds. She cannot relax. Her "Academy Instincts" are screaming.
- **Key Event:** **Lady Corinne** sits on a floral armchair, looking like a queen exiled to a dollhouse. She holds a porcelain shepherdess figurine with disdain. "It's dreadfully rustic, isn't it? If we're going to hide, must it be somewhere that smells like a grandmother's handbag?"
- **Key Event:** She notices a "Spider-Lily" in a vase. It is a rare, poisonous plant used by the Assassins' Guild. She also notices that Joyce’s knitting needles are made of "Null-Iron," a metal used to pierce kinetic shields.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Even in a sanctuary, she decodes the threat. The domesticity is a camouflage pattern she recognizes.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "This isn't a flower shop, Joyce. The perimeter sensors are military-grade. And you have a claymore mine under the welcome mat."
- **Key Event:** Joyce laughs, a warm, grandmotherly sound. She is bustling around the kitchen, boiling a kettle.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "A girl has to be safe in this neighborhood, dear. Would you prefer I let the riff-raff in?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "I'd prefer a safe house with a wine cellar, but one makes do."

### Scene 2: The Alert

- **Key Event:** A chime sounds on the wall-mounted comms unit. It’s a subtle, three-tone sequence.
- **Key Event:** To Hatcher, it sounds like a doorbell. To Joyce, it is "Code Black."
- **Key Event:** Code Black comes from Lady Vesper, the Merchant Lord. It means: "Eliminate all witnesses. Liquidation protocols active."
- **Key Event:** Joyce pauses mid-movement. Her back is to the room. Her shoulders stiffen for a fraction of a second, then relax.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Joyce):** The "Grandmother" persona—the woman who loves baking and flowers—is shoved into a mental box. The "Needle" takes the wheel. There is no hesitation, no guilt. Only programming.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Joyce** — She smiles at her reflection in the kettle. The smile doesn't reach her eyes. Her eyes are dead.
- **Key Event:** She reaches for the "Grandmother" mask, but it feels thinner than before. Every time she activates the "Needle" protocol, the cost is exacted immediately.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Joyce):** She looks at the knitting on the counter. A half-finished sock. _Who is this for?_ The thought floats across her mind like a dead leaf. She knows she was knitting it for someone she loved, someone with cold feet. But the name is gone. Burned as fuel for the transition from "Old Lady" to "Asset."
- **Key Event:** A tear leaks from her eye, but her hand doesn't tremble. She wipes it away with a knuckle that could punch through plywood. _Focus. The Mission is the only memory that stays._

### Scene 3: The Poison

- **Key Event:** Joyce prepares the tea service. A silver tray, fine china cups. The porcelain is so thin it is almost translucent, much like her own cover identity.
- **Key Event:** She opens a hidden compartment in her spice rack. The mechanism is biometric; it requires her fingerprint and a specific pulse rate (calm, resting) to open.
- **Key Event:** She takes out a vial of "Essence of Void." It is a clear, viscous liquid. It smells faintly of **Bitter Almonds** and preserved lilies.
- **Key Event:** She holds the vial up to the light. It is beautiful. It is the end of pain.
- **Key Event:** She adds three drops to each cup. _One for the silence. Two for the sleep. Three for the forgetting._ It is a painless poison; it simply stops the heart in mid-beat. A gentle way to tidy up.
- **Key Event:** She carries the tray into the parlor. She hums a lullaby. The tune is "The Hanged Man's Waltz," but she hums it with the cadence of a nursery rhyme.
- **Key Event:** She places a cup in front of Zephyr, who stirs but doesn't wake. She puts one in front of Hatcher. Hatcher looks at her. His eyes are narrowed, scanning her face. He sees the "Grandmother," but his instinct is itching.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "Drink up, dears. It’s chamomile and honey. It will settle your nerves and help the healing. You look so pale, Mr. Detective."
- **Key Event:** Hatcher nods, grateful but wary. He lifts the cup. Usefulness is his love language, and tea is a utility. But he doesn't drink immediately. He holds it, warming his hands, letting the steam rise.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Thanks, Joyce. My head’s pounding. Feels like I went ten rounds with a pile driver."

### Scene 4: The Sniff

- **Key Event:** Joyce approaches Angelica. She offers the floral teacup with trembling, elderly hands.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "For you, sweetie. You look so tired. Let Auntie Joyce take care of it."
- **Key Event:** Angelica reaches for the cup. The steam rises, curling around her fingers like a white snake.
- **Key Event:** The scent hits her. It is faint, masked by the heavy, cloying perfume of the lavender and the potpourri in the room. Most people would just smell "sweetness."
- **Key Event:** But Angelica spent three years in the **Academy’s Toxicology Wing**. She knows that _real_ almonds have a dusty, woody scent. This smell is too sharp. It activates the "Vomeronasal Response" in her augmented physiology.
- **Key Event:** Her brain dissects the aroma profile: _Synthetic ester. Cyanogenic glycoside. Hydrocyanic acid._
- **Key Event:** _Cyanide._
- **Key Event:** The realization is cold and instant. Her "Academy Instincts" override her social programming. The warm room, the doilies, the grandmother—it all inverts. The doilies are camouflage netting. The knitting needles are shanks. The tea is death.
- **Key Event:** Angelica’s hand freezes inches from the saucer. She looks up.
- **Key Event:** Joyce is still smiling, but her pulse in her neck is steady. Too steady. No micro-expressions of concern. No grandmotherly fussing. Just the flat, predatory gaze of a reptile waiting to strike.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes this isn't a betrayal; it's a transaction. Joyce isn't evil; she's a weapon being fired by someone else. She sees the emptiness in Joyce's eyes—the sacrifice of memory for capability—and recognizes a twisted mirror of herself.
- **Key Event:** Angelica slaps the cup from Joyce's hand. It shatters on the floor. The liquid hisses where it touches the rug, burning a hole through the wool.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher drops his cup, scrambling for his gun. Zephyr falls off the couch, waking up instantly with a knife in his hand.
- **Key Event:** Joyce doesn't flinch. The mask dissolves instantly. She stands straighter, her posture correcting from "elderly stoop" to "combat readiness." She pulls the Null-Iron knitting needles from her bun, her hair falling loose.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "Pity. I hate cleaning up blood. The tea was much cleaner."
- **Key Event:** She lunges at Angelica with the speed of a viper.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't drink! It's almond and ash! Cover the doors!"
