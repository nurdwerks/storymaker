# Character Profile: Baroness Shard

**Archetype:** The Sycophant / The Echo
**True Sin:** ENVY (She desperately craves Vesper's status and is willing to debase herself to get it).
**Virtue Mask:** ADMIRATION (She claims her imitation is the highest form of flattery).

## I. Role in the Story

Baroness Shard is a minor noblewoman who desperately tries to emulate Vesper’s "Glass Look." She is a cruel mimic who survives by being useful to Vesper’s social warfare.

- **The Behavior:** She repeats Vesper’s insults to Angelica, hoping to earn a crumb of favor from the Glass Queen.
- **The Attitude:** She treats Angelica like a "stray dog that wandered into a cathedral," viewing the protagonist's presence as a pollution of the high-society space they occupy.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 22: The Discordant Note](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L1765-1772)
- **Defining Quote:** "She is no longer part of the composition." (Spoken by Vesper, reveals flaw: ENVY/SYCOPHANCY)
