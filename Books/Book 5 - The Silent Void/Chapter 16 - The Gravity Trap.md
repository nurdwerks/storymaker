## Chapter 16: The Gravity Trap

### Scene 1: The Event Horizon

- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris's physical proximity to the singularity destabilizes the magnetic containment field ("the bottle"), causing a localized gravity spike of 5G that pins the entire group to the deck plating.
- **Detailed Description:** The containment chamber, already vibrating with the hum of the black hole, erupts into chaos. The amber warning lights shatter as the pressure wave hits. The floor plates groan and buckle, rivets popping like gunshots. Aris, now suspended in the accretion disk's pull, acts as a conductor for the gravitational shear. The gravity in the room increases exponentially. Angelica, Kaelen, Ria, and Ironwood are slammed to the floor, their bodies heavy as lead. Breathing becomes a struggle against the weight of their own ribcages. The air itself seems to thicken, dust motes freezing in mid-air before being sucked toward the event horizon. The mud from the jungle floor begins to flow uphill, defying physics, drawn into the maw of the singularity.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ironwood fights a battle against his own biology. His mechanical limbs are rated for high stress, but his organic organs are failing. He feels his heart laboring to pump blood. He realizes that this is the enemy he cannot shoot—physics. He feels a flash of panic, not for himself, but for the mission. If they die here, the ship dies with them.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Refuses to die on his knees, using his hydraulic strength to force his body upward, effectively doing a push-up against five times the force of gravity to clear a path for the others.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "I will not die on my knees! Crawl! Back! Get back!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I... can't... breathe... My lungs... are crushing... my spine..."

- **Key Event:** The gravitational pull intensifies, turning the room into a centrifuge. Debris, loose equipment, and the mud flow accelerate toward the singularity, creating a deadly debris field.
- **Detailed Description:** Metal crates slide across the deck with the sound of screeching banshees. A loose pipe flies past Angelica's head, missing her by inches, and vanishes into the black hole, spaghettifying into a long thread of metal before disappearing. The noise is deafening—a roar of tearing metal and the high-pitched whine of the singularity feeding. The light from the event horizon shifts from blue to violet, bathing the room in a sickly, radioactive glow.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica analyzes the situation with cold detachment despite the crushing pressure. She calculates the rate of decay. The magnetic bottle is failing. In less than three minutes, the singularity will consume the entire sector. She looks at Aris, who is now barely visible in the distortion field. She knows he is dead. She knows that trying to save him will kill them all. The logic is brutal, but unavoidable.

### Scene 2: The Decision

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes the only way to survive is to abandon Aris and seal the blast doors, cutting off the sector.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica grabs a handhold on the floor grating, her fingers bleeding from the effort. She locks eyes with Kaelen, who is pinned under the weight of his own shadow-construct, Umbra. She sees the hesitation in his face—the warrior's refusal to leave a man behind. But she shouts the order over the roar of the gravity well. She points to the emergency bulkhead controls near the exit.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Makes the difficult command to abandon Aris, acknowledging that physics does not negotiate. She accepts the burden of being the one to cut the rope.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Get up or get flat! We have to leave him! He's gone! Seal the door!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "The shadow... it's too heavy. Umbra is pinned! I can't move him!"

- **Key Event:** The group begins a desperate crawl toward the exit, fighting the pull of the singularity with every inch.
- **Detailed Description:** It is a nightmare of physical exertion. They dig their fingers into the gaps in the floor plates, dragging their bodies weight by weight. Ria uses her Titan-Form to anchor herself, grabbing Kaelen's harness and hauling him forward. Ironwood uses his mechanical claw to punch holes in the deck for grip. The mud flows past them like a river, sucking at their legs. The air is thin, pulled away by the vacuum. Their vision tunnels as oxygen deprivation sets in.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen struggles with the physical reality of his magic. Umbra, usually weightless, is now a massive anchor. The gravity treats the shadow-matter like lead. He feels the bond straining, the entity panic-stricken in his mind. He has to partially sever the link, suppressing Umbra to lighten the load, which feels like cutting off a limb.

### Scene 3: The Door

- **Key Event:** They reach the bulkhead. Ironwood and Ria force the manual override wheel to turn, fighting the pressure sealing the door.
- **Detailed Description:** The wheel is red-hot from friction. Ironwood clamps his drill-arm onto the spokes and engages the motor. The gears grind, sparks showering them. Slowly, agonizingly, the heavy blast door begins to slide shut. Through the narrowing gap, they see Aris one last time. He is not screaming. He is staring into the light, his body elongating, his lab coat shredding into atoms. He looks... ecstatic.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica watches the door close on a man she worked with, a man she hated but respected. She feels the finality of the seal. The heavy thud of the door locking in place cuts off the roar of the singularity, leaving them in a sudden, ringing silence. The gravity returns to normal instantly, dropping them to the floor.

- **Key Event:** The group lies on the floor of the safe corridor, gasping for air, traumatized by the near-death experience.
- **Detailed Description:** They are covered in mud, sweat, and blood. No one speaks. The only sound is the ragged breathing of survivors. The red emergency lights strobe rhythmically. Ironwood checks his power levels; he is in the red. Ria checks her skin; the metal plating is dented. Angelica sits up, clutching Aris's datapad—the only thing that came out of that room besides them.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We left him. We just... left him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We didn't leave him, Ria. He was already part of the math."
