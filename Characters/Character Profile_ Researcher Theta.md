# Character Profile: Researcher Theta

**Archetype:** The Disinterested Scientist / The Data Point
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Moral indifference; treating life and death as mere variables in a long-term study).
**Virtue Mask:** FIDELITY (He claims his detachment is the only way to ensure "Objective Results").

## I. Role in the Story

Researcher Theta is a high-ranking scientist in Dr. Aris's team. He views everything through the lens of long-term observation and data collection.

- **The Detachment:** He notes Angelica’s emotional reactions in a tablet as if she were a lab animal, treating her tears or anger as "interesting data points" rather than human emotions.
- **The Erasure:** His refusal to engage with her as a person makes Angelica feel profoundly alone and insignificant in the grand scheme of Aris's plans.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Absolute Exposure / Data Breach. Theta’s private research logs, which contain highly sensitive and unethical data about Zenith noble families, are leaked to the public. He is arrested by the Praetorian Guard to prevent further leaks.
- **Impact on Dr. Aris:** Aris is forced to distance himself from his former colleague. He becomes even more secretive and paranoid, purging his remaining data and accelerating his experiments to stay ahead of the "inevitable" Zenith investigation.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Data" is compromised. The remaining researchers live in a state of constant fear, as they realize that their "objective" detachedness won't protect them from the political consequences of their work for Aris.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 4 | Chapter 03 | *The Silent Partner | In the corner, slumped over a terminal, is the frozen corpse of **Researcher Theta**. Frost covers his lab coat. Aris occasionally talks to the body, asking for "variables," completely ignoring the fact that his assistant has been dead for weeks. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 03 | Dialog | **Dr. Aris:** "Don't touch the glass. The condensation ruins the view. Theta, shift the spectral range to gamma... oh, right. You're indisposed. Useless." |
