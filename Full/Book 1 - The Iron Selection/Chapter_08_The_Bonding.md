# Chapter 8: The Bonding

The elevator ride down took seven minutes.

Seven minutes of silence. Seven minutes of pressurized descent that popped eardrums and made the air taste like recycled copper. The lift was large enough to hold the entire First Year cohort—Squads Gold, Silver, and Iron—packed together like cattle in a slaughterhouse chute.

Angelica stood near the back, pressed against the cold industrial mesh of the wall. Beside her, Ria was practically vibrating. Not with fear, but with a kinetic energy that made her bounce on the balls of her feet.

"They say the pressure down here is artificial," Ria whispered, her voice too loud in the confined space. "They keep it high to sedate the big ones. Like a gravity blanket for monsters."

"Or to keep us disoriented," Angelica replied, checking her pulse on her wrist. Eighty beats per minute. Elevated, but steady. "Oxygen mix is running rich. Around 24 percent. They want us awake, just docile."

"Where's the fun in docile?" Ria grinned, showing too many teeth. She bounced on her heels, the kinetic energy practically radiating off her. "I heard a rumor that last year, a kid from Bronze Squad tried to bond with a Bore-Worm and got eaten. Like, totally consumed. They didn't even find his boots."

"That's not a rumor," a voice said from the shadows. "That was Cadet Jenson. And it wasn't a Bore-Worm. It was a Thresher-Maw."

Angelica turned. It was Kaelen Night. He was standing in the corner of the lift, so still he blended into the dark industrial mesh. He wasn't looking at them. He was cleaning his monocle with a silk cloth.

"And he wasn't eaten," Kaelen added, replacing the monocle. "He was assimilated. There is a difference."

"Assimilation implies a biological merger," Angelica noted. "Digestion implies broken down for fuel."

"To the Maw, they are the same thing," Kaelen said emotionlessly.

Ria laughed. "See? High stakes! If you mess up, you become lunch. Or a battery. Either way, it's better than sitting in class listening to Halloway drone on about the 'GLORIOUS ANCIENTS'."

"It is not better," Kaelen said. "It is simply a more efficient form of recycling."

Angelica looked at him. "You don't like the Selection, Night?"

"The Selection is a necessary filter," he replied. "But the criteria are... flawed. We are judging fish by their ability to climb trees. Bonding with a bio-weapon does not prove leadership. It proves compatibility with violence."

"Violence is the only currency that matters down here," Ria said, cracking her knuckles.

"Then we are all bankrupt," Kaelen murmured.

The lift slowed. The groaning of the massive hydraulic pistons died away, replaced by a deep, resonant thrum that vibrated through the floor plates. It wasn't a mechanical sound. It was organic. It was the sound of a thousand massive hearts beating in sync with the hum of containment fields.

The doors hissed open.

The smell hit them first.

It wasn't just the smell of animals—that musky, warm scent of fur and biology. It was the smell of _power_. It smelled like a thunderstorm trapped in a bottle, mixed with the acrid tang of ozone, the metallic sharpness of blood, and the sickly-sweet rot of exotic manure.

They shuffled out into the Bonding Fields.

"Fields" was a euphemism. It was a cavern. A subterranean dome so vast that storm clouds gathered near the ceiling, trapped weather systems generated by the heat of the beasts and the cold of the cooling systems. The walls were lined with reinforced containment units—force-field cages that stacked ten stories high, creating a canyon of trapped nightmares.

The air hummed. It wasn't a sound; it was a pressure. The psychic weight of the creatures pressed against Angelica's skull, a low-grade headache that felt like static on a radio channel.

"Welcome," Professor Halloway’s voice boomed over the PA system, distorted by the sheer volume of the space. "To the Menagerie."

He stood on a raised observation platform in the center of the cavern, a small, gold-robed figure surrounded by armed Wardens. He held a shock-baton that arced with violet energy, the crackle of it seemingly insignificant against the scale of the monsters around him.

"You are here to choose," Halloway continued, looking down at them like an entomologist examining a jar of bugs. "And to be chosen."

Angelica walked forward, her eyes scanning the cages. The sheer variety was staggering. It wasn't just nature; it was nature remixed by a sadist with a limitless budget.

To her left, behind a shimmering wall of blue energy, a Chrome-Tiger paced. It was massive, easily the size of a transport hauler, its fur significantly replaced by sub-dermal armor plating that shimmered like oil on water. Its fangs were serrated steel, dripping a synthetic venom that hissed when it hit the concrete floor. It locked eyes with a boy from Squad Silver—Calculus, was it?—and growled, a sound that rattled Angelica’s ribs.

To her right, a Wyvern clung to the walls of a vertical silo cage. It had no front legs, only massive, bat-like wings that were grafted with flamethrower glands. Its throat glowed with a dull, internal heat, pulsing with every breath.

And further back, in the shadows of the lower pits, something truly massive moved. Coils the thickness of subway trains slid over each other with the sound of tectonic plates grinding. A Diamond-Back Cobra, genetically scaled up to hunt skyscrapers.

"The procedure is simple," Halloway announced, his voice bored. "You do not pick a pet. You do not buy a companion. You invoke a weapon."

The students gathered in a loose semi-circle around the platform. The segregation was still there—Gold in the front, eager and shining; Silver behind them, calculating; Iron at the back, just trying to stay out of range of the teeth.

"You will approach a unit," Halloway explained. "You will lower the external shield. You will project your Resonance. If the beast responds, the bond is initiated. If you project fear, you are food. If you project nothing, you are dismissed. There are no refunds on lost limbs."

A ripple of unease went through the crowd. This wasn't a classroom. This was a meat grinder.

"Project Resonance?" Jax whispered, leaning down to Angelica. "I don't even know how to project a burp on command. How am I supposed to talk to a cyber-lion?"

"It's not talking, Jax," Angelica said, her eyes fixed on the Chrome-Tiger. "It's a broadcast. They are receivers. You have to tune your frequency to theirs."

"My frequency is 'Punch'," Jax grumbled.

"Then find something that likes to be punched," she said, distracted.

She was analyzing the containment fields. They were Level 5 Energy Barriers. Standard frequency modulation. But there was a flicker in the grid—a micro-second variance in the refresh rate. The power demand down here must be astronomical. If the grid failed, even for a second...

"Step forward!" Halloway barked. "Squad Gold. You have priority."

The Golden children moved forward, their movements practiced, elegant. They approached the Prime Beasts—the Griffins, the Solar-Bears, the creatures that looked like heraldry come to life.

But while they postured, someone from Squad Iron moved.

Ria didn't wait for permission. She didn't wait for Halloway to call her name. She walked past the shifting mass of Squad Silver, shoulders checking a Duke's son out of her way.

"Hey!" the boy shouted. "Wait your turn, Silt-Rat!"

Ria ignored him. She ignored Halloway. She walked straight up to the glass of a massive, reinforced tank near the front.

Inside, something heavily armored was sleeping. It looked like a boulder with legs. A Rhino-Beetle, bio-engineered to be the size of a tank. Its horn was a hydraulic ram. Its shell was chiton reinforced with depleted uranium weave.

Ria pressed her face to the force field. Her eyes were wide, manic. Her pupils were dilated so much they were almost black. She wasn't scared. She was hungry.

She tapped on the barrier. _Thump. Thump. Thump._

"Wakey wakey," she whispered.

The ground shook. The beetle shifted. A massive, compound eye opened, gleaming like a faceted jewel. It looked at her.

Halloway raised his baton. "Candidate! Step back! That is a Siege-Class organism! It requires a Class 4 Resonance to even wake up!"

Ria didn't look back. She grinned, her reflection ghostly in the energy field.

"I don't want a pet," she said, her voice cutting through the hum of the room. "I want a siege engine. I want something that breaks walls."

She placed both hands on the field. She didn't close her eyes. She didn't meditate. She just _pushed_.

It wasn't a subtle projection. It was a psychic scream. A wave of raw, unfiltered aggression that slammed into the beast's mind.

The beetle roared—a sound like metal tearing. It slammed its horn against the barrier, once, twice. The force field flared white.

Ria didn't flinch. She laughed.

"Yeah!" she shouted. "That's it! Get mad! Come on!"

Halloway watched, his mouth slightly open. He lowered his baton. He had expected her to be crushed. He hadn't expected the beast to like it.

Angelica watched Ria, a small smile touching her lips. Ria didn't understand frequency modulation. She didn't understand interface protocols. But she understood one thing perfectly: violence recognized violence.

But not everyone was Ria.

"Next!" Halloway yelled, trying to regain control of the spectacle.

The line shuffled forward. But after Ria's display, the energy in the room had shifted. It wasn't excitement anymore. It was dread.

Jax stepped up. The big Gear-Grinder looked at the massive Chrome-Tiger, then at his own hands. He cracked his knuckles, the sound like dry branches snapping.

"Okay," he muttered. "Big cat. Cool. We can do this."

He walked up to the barrier. The Tiger looked at him. It didn't growl. It just stared, its cybernetic tail twitching with a metronome's precision.

Jax took a deep breath. He closed his eyes. He tried to project.

"Be... cool," he whispered. "We are... friends. Heavy. Strong."

Nothing happened. The Tiger yawned, revealing a mouth full of hydraulic pistons and razor-wire. It turned around and began to lick its flank, completely dismissing him.

"Dismissed," Halloway droned. "No resonance. You are a stone trying to talk to a radio. Next."

Jax walked back, his shoulders slumped. "It ignored me," he said to Angelica. "I poured my heart out, and it licked its butt."

"You weren't projecting a function," Angelica said. "You were projecting a feeling. Machines don't care about your feelings, Jax."

Next was a girl from Squad Iron named Kila. She was small, nervous. She approached a containment unit holding a swarm of Nano-Hornets. The insects were the size of fists, their bodies shimmering with iridescent photovoltaic cells.

Kila trembled. She put her hand on the glass.

The hornets reacted instantly. They swarmed the glass, buzzing with a high-pitched whine that set everyone's teeth on edge. They formed a pattern—a skull.

Kila screamed and pulled her hand back.

"Fear response," Halloway noted, sounding bored. "The swarm smells your adrenaline. If the barrier wasn't there, they would have stripped the flesh from your bones in twelve seconds. Step back."

Kila ran back to the line, weeping.

It went on like that for twenty minutes. Student after student stepped up, projected their intent, and was either ignored or threatened. The beasts were picky. They were weapons of war, and they didn't suffer fools. A few of the Gold Squad managed to bond—a tall girl with a Solar-Bear, a boy with a pair of Razor-Hawks—but the bond was weak. It was based on surface-level compatibility, not deep resonance.

Then it was the Silver Squad's turn.

"Cassian Valerius. Squad Silver. Step forward."

Cassian stepped out of the crowd. He was everything the Academy poster-boys aspired to be: tall, blonde, with a jawline that could cut glass and an expression of permanent, mild disdain. He adjusted his cuffs, glancing at his reflection in the polished surface of his datapad before handing it to a nearby Iron student to hold.

"Watch closely," he said, not to anyone specific, but to the collective ear of the room. "This is how a Highborn commands nature."

He didn't walk toward the beetles or the tigers. He walked toward the Fire-Drake.

The Drake was a nightmare of scales and heat. It was curled around a heating vent in its silo, its eyes closed, steam venting lazily from its nostrils. It was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful—destructive, primal, and totally indifferent to human ambition.

Cassian stopped at the barrier. He didn't tap on the glass like Ria. He stood with his feet shoulder-width apart, clasped his hands behind his back, and projected... arrogance.

"Heel," he commanded.

He didn't shout it. He said it with the absolute conviction of someone who had never been told 'no' in his entire life.

The Drake's eye opened. A vertical slit of molten gold.

"I am Cassian of House Valerius," the boy stated, raising his chin. "My blood is the blood of the Founders. You were bred to serve me. Submit."

He pushed his Resonance against the barrier. It was a sharp, brittle thing—a mental whip. He was trying to hurt the beast into obedience. He was trying to break it.

Angelica watched the Drake's pupil dilate. She saw the subtle shift in the creature's posture—the tensing of the neck muscles, the slight opening of the throat glottis.

"He's reading it wrong," she whispered.

"What?" Jax asked, tearing his eyes away from the spectacle.

"He thinks he's projecting dominance," she said, her voice low. "But he's scared. His heart rate is one-twenty. His cortisol is spiking. The Drake can smell it. Hormones pass through the barrier fields."

"So?"

"So," Angelica said, taking a small step back. "To a predator, fear masked as aggression isn't authority. It's a challenge."

The Drake uncoiled. It moved with a terrifying, fluid speed, flowing down the silo wall like liquid magma. It slammed against the barrier, face-to-face with Cassian.

Cassian didn't flinch. He doubled down. "I said SUBMIT!" he screamed, throwing all his mental weight against the glass.

The Drake opened its maw.

It didn't roar. It exhaled.

A blast of superheated plasma slammed into the force field. The barrier flared—a blinding white flash that turned the air in the room instantly hot. The field held—barely—but the thermal transfer was massive.

Cassian screamed.

The heat wave hit him like a physical hammer. His eyebrows singed off in a millisecond. The synthetic fibers of his pristine uniform melted, fusing to his skin. He was thrown back, skidding across the concrete floor, smoking and wailing.

"My face! My face!" he shrieked, clawing at his skin.

The Drake watched him, smoke drifting from its nostrils. It looked bored. It turned its back and climbed back up the silo.

Halloway didn't even step down from his platform. He just checked a box on his slate.

"Failure," he announced, his voice dry. "Squad Silver, retrieve your debris. Take him to the burn ward. Tell them to use the cheap gel; he wasted Academy resources."

Two Silver students rushed forward, grabbing the sobbing Cassian and dragging him away. The smell of burnt hair and melted plastic hung heavy in the air.

"You cannot command a weapon that is smarter than you," Halloway lectured, addressing the stunned crowd. "These beasts were not bred for parades. They do not care about your lineage. They do not care about your father's credit score. They care about capacity. If you offer them a cup, they will not fill it. If you offer them a lake, they will swim."

He pointed his baton at the rest of them.

"Next."

Angelica watched Cassian dragging his feet as he was hauled out. The lesson was clear, but the students were learning the wrong thing. They were whispering about "more power," about "stronger will." They thought Cassian failed because he wasn't strong enough.

_Wrong,_ she thought, turning away from the crowd. _He failed because he treated it like a dog. It's not a dog. It's a bio-organic combat system._

Halloway was wrong too. "Lake" implies capacity, but "capacity" implies passive storage. These things were kinetic. They didn't want a lake. They wanted a turbine. They wanted someone who could take their raw output and give it direction.

Input. Process. Output.

It was just a circuit. A very angry, very teeth-filled circuit.

She drifted away from the main group, her eyes scanning the active containment units. She needed something. But what?

She paused in front of a cage holding a Cyber-Wolf. The creature was impressive—high-tensile muscle fibers woven with carbon nanotubes, a jaw pressure that could snap rebar. It paced the cage, its yellow eyes locking onto her.

_Option A: Canid-class,_ she thought. _Advantages: Pack tactics, high mobility, loyalty subroutines. Disadvantages: Required constant affirmation. If you didn't pet it, it got depressed. If you didn't lead it, it got confused._

She shook her head. "Too needy."

She moved to the next cage. A Razor-Hawk perched on a metal branch, cleaning its vanadium-alloy feathers. It was fast, lethal, a master of aerial suppression.

_Option B: Avian-class,_ she analyzed. _Advantages: Air superiority, recon capability. Disadvantages: Hollow bones (or the synthetic equivalent). Fragile. One lucky shot with a flak cannon and you're holding a bag of scrap._

"Too fragile," she murmured.

She stopped at a heavy-containment unit. Inside, a Magma-Golem slumbered. It wasn't organic at all—just a construct of animated stone and geothermal cores. It was basically a walking tank.

_Option C: Construct-class,_ she noted. _Advantages: Invulnerable to small arms fire, intimidating, immense torque. Disadvantages: Slow. So slow. By the time it throws a punch, the target has moved three zip codes._

"Too slow."

She wasn't looking for a pet. She wasn't looking for a shield. She was looking for... efficiency. She was looking for a variable that balanced the equation of survival.

She moved deeper into the shadows.

She moved toward the back of the facility, past the prime exhibits, past the flashing lights of the active containment units. The air grew colder here. The smell of ozone faded, replaced by the smell of dust and stagnant oil.

This was the "Decommissioned" sector. The B-Roll monsters. The failed experiments.

She walked past cages covered in tarps. Past units that were dark, their power cells drained.

She stopped at the very end of the row. Unit 734.

It was a small cage, barely ten feet square. The force field was off, replaced by a simple chain-link gate with a rusted padlock. Inside, under a moth-eaten canvas tarp, was a pile of scrap.

It looked like someone had taken a gargoyle, smashed it with a hammer, and left it to rot for a century.

One wing was bent at a sickening angle, the metal feathers twisted and dull. A leg was detached, lying in the dust. The head was buried under the wing, hidden.

It was trash. It was junk.

Angelica reached out and touched the cold metal of the cage.

_Tick... tick... tick._

It was faint. So faint she felt it in her fingertips rather than heard it with her ears. A rhythmic, mechanical vibration.

It wasn't a heartbeat. It was a clock.

"Leave it, Ward."

Halloway had followed her. He stood a few feet away, leaning on his cane, his face twisted in a sneer of disgust.

"That is Unit 734," he said. "A Chrono-Gryphon prototype from the Old War. Logic-core seized. Hydraulics calcified. It's been inert since before your grandfather was born. It's scheduled for the smelter tomorrow."

He gestured back toward the main group.

"Don't waste your Resonance on garbage. Go try the Cyber-Rat. It's more your speed."

Angelica ignored him. She ignored the insult. She was listening to the tick.

"It's not inert," she whispered.

She looked at the pile of scrap. She didn't see junk. She saw potential. She saw a mechanism that was stuck in a loop, waiting for a variable to break the cycle.

"It's just paused," she said, her voice gaining strength. "It's waiting for an input."

"It killed the last three handlers who tried to touch it," Halloway warned, his voice dropping an octave. "It didn't bite them. It tore their minds apart. The interface is corrupted. It's a meat-grinder for neurons."

"They tried to force the lock," Angelica said, gripping the rusted padlock.

She looked back at Halloway.

"I am the key."

She yanked the rusted gate open. The hinges screamed, a sound that echoed through the silence of the dome like a dying animal.

Halloway took a menacing step forward. "I forbid it, Ward! That is Academy property and you are damaging it! Step away or I will have you expelled for insubordination!"

He reached out with his cane, intending to hook her arm, to physically drag her back from the edge of what he considered suicide.

But he hit a wall.

A shadow had detached itself from the gloom. Kaelen Night stood between them. He didn't draw a weapon. He didn't raise his hands. He simply existed in the space Halloway wanted to occupy, his presence so heavy and absolute that the Professor physically recoiled.

"Let her work," Kaelen said. His voice was flat, devoid of emotion, devoid of threat. It was the voice of a fact.

Halloway hesitated. He looked at the boy—at the strange, light-absorbing quality of his uniform, at the stillness of his posture. Even a Senior Archivist knew better than to push a Shadow-Walker.

"If she dies," Halloway spat, straightening his robes, "it is on your record, Night. I wash my hands of this incompetence."

Angelica didn't hear them. The world outside the cage had ceased to exist.

She knelt in the dust, uncaring of the grime staining the knees of her uniform. She was alone with the machine.

She didn't feel fear. She felt... reverence.

"Okay," she whispered, her breath fogging in the cold air radiating from the metal. "Let's see what you are."

She reached out a hand. Palm up. Fingers relaxed.

She didn't project dominance. She didn't shout commands. She didn't try to be a master.

She closed her eyes and projected a query.

_Function?_

Silence.

_Status?_

Silence.

She pushed deeper, past the barrier of the rust, past the cold metal shell. She used her Resonance not as a hammer, but as a probe. A wire. A connection.

It was like sliding into a bath of ice water. The shock of it made her gasp, her back arching involuntarily. The machine's mind—or what was left of it—was a chaotic storm of static and corrupted data. It was screaming. A silent, digital scream of a system that had been trapped in a boot-loop for a hundred years.

_Error. Error. Logic Gate 7 Compromised. Hydraulic Pressure Zero. Chronometric Stabilizer Offline. Error._

It was painful. It felt like someone was scraping sandpaper against the inside of her skull. But Angelica didn't pull back. She leaned into it.

"I hear you," she whispered, tears leaking from her squeezed-shut eyes. "I hear the noise. It's okay. We can fix the noise."

The present faded. The smell of the Menagerie—ozone and manure—was replaced by the smell of stagnant water and rust.

---

_Subject: 12-B. Sector 4. The Silt-Works._
_Age: 9._

The water filtration unit was dead.

It was a massive thing, a rusted hulk of iron and pipes that sat in the center of the communal block like a dying god. It was supposed to purify the runoff from the High City, turning the toxic sludge into something drinkable.

But the main impeller had seized three days ago. The water coming out of the taps was brown and smelled like sulfur.

The Sector Governor had already written it off. "Parts on order," he'd said, which meant _you people can drink mud until the next budget cycle._

Angelica sat in the mud beneath the machine. She was small enough to fit into the crawlspace where the gears were housed. It was dark, wet, and freezing.

"Angie, get out of there!" her mother called from the doorway, her voice thin with worry. "If the Governor catches you touching the tech..."

"It's not dead, Mom," Angelica whispered. She had her ear pressed against the cold iron casing of the impeller housing. "It's crying."

She could hear it. A tiny, rhythmic _clunk-hiss-clunk_ that was buried under the silence of the seized motor.

She closed her eyes. She didn't see the rust. She visualized the machine as it was supposed to be. She saw the perfect geometry of the drive shaft, the smooth rotation of the bearings, the flow of the water.

_The calcification is on the secondary valve,_ she thought. _It's choking. It can't breathe._

She reached into her pocket and pulled out a stolen bottle of vinegar—precious, acidic vinegar she'd traded her lunch for.

"Just drink this," she whispered to the machine.

She poured the vinegar onto the seized bearing. She visualized the acid eating the calcium. She visualized the bond breaking.

She put her hand on the heavy iron flywheel. It weighed more than she did.

"Turn," she commanded. Not with her voice, but with her will. "You have a job. People are thirsty. Turn."

She pushed. Her small muscles strained. She gritted her teeth until they felt like they would crack.

_Clunk._

The wheel moved an inch.

_Hiss._

Steam vented from a pressure release.

_Clunk._

And then, with a groan that shook the floor, the impeller turned. The hum started—low at first, then rising to a steady, powerful thrum.

Water—clean, clear water—began to rush through the pipes.

Angelica sat back in the mud, panting, smiling at the machine. It wasn't a monster. It was just a thing that needed to be understood.

---

The memory washed over her, merging with the reality of the Bonding Field.

She began to visualize.

She didn't visualize a beast obeying her. She visualized a schematic.

In her mind's eye, she built the Gryphon. She saw the seized gears and greased them with thought. She saw the broken logic gates and bridged them with will. She saw the bent wing and applied the vector force to straighten it.

_You aren't dead,_ she projected into the storm. _You're just unwound. You've forgotten what you're for._

She felt the machine hesitate. The screaming static quieted, replaced by a low, wary hum.

_Input recognized,_ a voice echoed in her head. It wasn't a voice like a human's. It was the sound of grinding stone and ticking clocks converted into thought. _User Identity: Unknown. Clearance: None._

_User Identity: Mechanic,_ Angelica corrected. _Clearance: Absolute._

She grabbed the cold metal of the Gryphon's head with both hands.

"Wake up."

Blue light, faint at first, flickered deep within the tangled scrap pile of the Gryphon's chest. It pulsed like a dying star.

Then, the sound.

_CLICK. WHIRR. SNAP._

It was the sound of resurrection.

The pile moved. Rust flaked off in clouds, orange dust swirling in the sudden displacement of air. The bent wing snapped back into alignment with a violent, sickening jerk that would have shattered bone.

Halloway gasped. Kaelen took a half-step back, his hand drifting to his belt.

The Gryphon stood up.

It was not a bird. It was not a lion. It was a weapon of war forged in an age when war was an art form. It was the size of a large puma, but denser, made of a heavy, light-adsorbing alloy that seemed to drink the shadows. Its feathers were razor-edged steel vanes. Its beak was a curved punch-dagger.

It shook itself, sending a shower of dust and metal filings into the air.

And then its eyes opened.

Shutter apertures spiraled open with a soft mechanical hiss. Glowing blue lenses focused instantly on Angelica.

The weight of its gaze was physical. It scanned her. She could feel the lasers mapping her bone density, her heart rate, her thermal signature.

_Target acquired,_ the voice in her head said. But it wasn't hostile. It was... waiting.

Halloway was trembling. "Impossible," he whispered. "That is... that is a Chrono-Gryphon. It shouldn't function without a Master Key. The security protocols alone should have liquefied her frontal lobe."

Angelica stood up. Her legs were shaky, but she locked her knees. She looked at Halloway.

"You called him broken, Professor," she said, her voice raspy. "Good. So am I. Broken things know how to survive because they know how to put themselves back together."

She looked back at the Gryphon. She held out her arm.

"Aeon," she said. "Status."

The Gryphon made a sound—a series of electronic chirps that sounded like a modem handshake. It crouched, its powerful hydraulics compressing, and then leaped.

It landed on her shoulder.

Fifty pounds of dense alloy slammed into her. Angelica staggered, grunting under the impact. Her knees buckled, threatening to drop her to the concrete.

But she didn't fall.

She gritted her teeth, finding her center of gravity. She straightened her spine, forcing her body to accept the weight.

And in that moment, the bond sealed.

It wasn't just a weight on her shoulder. It was a weight in her mind. A HUD flickered into existence in her peripheral vision—scrolling lines of green text overlaying the world.

_Telemetry Loop: Active._
_Threat Assessment: Online._
_Chronal Sync: 12%._
_Bond Status: Prime._

The world shifted. Through Aeon's eyes, the gloom of the Menagerie vanished, replaced by a high-contrast wireframe of thermal gradients and structural stress points. She could see the heat blooming in Halloway's cheeks, a jagged red aura of fear. She could see the cool, efficient circulation of Kaelen's blood, flowing blue and steady. She could see the micro-fractures in the concrete floor beneath the Rhino-Beetle's weight, glowing like spiderwebs.

It wasn't just sight. It was data. A constant stream of variables flooding her cortex, analyzing trajectory, velocity, and probability.

It felt like armor. It felt like for the first time in her life, she wasn't just a girl. She was a component in a larger machine. A machine that worked.

She looked at Ria, who had wandered over, her own resonance fading as she stared at the metal hawk.

"Only you would pick the rust-bucket, Angel," Ria said, shaking her head. But there was no mockery in her voice, only a stunned respect. "Seriously? A dragon was right there."

Angelica reached up and stroked the cold, sharp feathers of Aeon's neck. The Gryphon purred—a deep, subsonic vibration that rattled her teeth.

"He's not a bucket," Angelica said, looking at the stunned faces of Squad Silver, at the terrified Halloway, at the silent Kaelen Night.

"He's time," she said. "And time conquers everything. Even dragons."

---

The adrenaline crash didn't happen immediately. It waited until the medical team arrived.

They swarmed the cage like white-clad beetles, carrying scanners, restraints, and sedatives. Halloway had called them in a panic, claiming a "Containment Breach" and "Unsanctioned Resurrection of Class-X Tech."

"Stand down!" the lead medic barked, aiming a stun-baton at the gryphon. "Step away from the construct, Cadet!"

Aeon hissed. It wasn't a biological sound; it was the sound of a steam valve releasing pressure. His steel feathers flared, creating a shield wall around Angelica. The blue lenses of his eyes cycled to red—_Targeting Mode_.

"No!" Angelica shouted, stepping in front of the gryphon. She raised her hand, not to stop the medics, but to signal Aeon. _Standby. Non-hostile._

She felt the command ripple through the bond. It was effortless. The gryphon powered down instantly, the red light fading back to a watchful blue. His feathers smoothed. He sat back on his haunches, looking for all the world like a loyal, if terrifying, statue.

The medics hesitated. They had dealt with tigers and bears. They knew how to tranq a biological nervous system. They had no idea what to do with a machine that looked at them with calculated indifference.

"I'm fine," Angelica said, holding out her arms. "He's fine. We're stable."

A medic cautiously approached, running a bio-scanner over her. The device chirped a warning.

"Heart rate is one-sixty," the medic called out. "Resonance levels are... abnormal. I'm reading a symbiotic feedback loop. The construct is feeding off her neural bio-electricity, but..." He tapped the screen, frowning. "It's refining it. Her stress levels are actually dropping."

Halloway stormed over, his face flushed. "Impossible. That unit is a mind-killer. Check for cerebral hemorrhaging. Check for madness!"

"Professor," the medic said, "her brain activity is optimal. In fact, it's higher than her baseline. The connection isn't parasitic. It's mutual."

Angelica looked at Halloway. "You were right about one thing, Professor. It does require authorized clearance."

She reached up and scratched Aeon behind his metal ear-tufts. The gryphon leaned into the touch, a low hum vibrating in his chest.

"But authority isn't given," she said, quoting the First Law of the Iron Squad. "It's engineered."

Kaelen Night watched from the shadows, his expression unreadable. He tapped a command into his own datapad, sending a secure message to an encrypted frequency.
