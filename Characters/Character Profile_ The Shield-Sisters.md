# Character Profile: The Shield-Sisters (Astrid & Brun)

**Archetype:** The Sisters / The Iron Wall
**True Sin:** ENVY (Of the soft life they associate with the Zenith, and of any attention that distracts Ragnar from the tribe).
**Virtue Mask:** VIGILANCE (They frame their social exclusion of Angelica as "Protecting the King's Back").

## I. Role in the Story

Astrid and Brun are fierce warriors who guard Ragnar’s back. They represent the internal family bond of the Warband that Angelica is forever barred from entering.

- **The Behavior:** They braid each other’s hair and share food by the fire, creating a domestic circle of feminine power that excludes "outsiders."
- **The Cold:** They glare at Angelica and physically block her from sitting near the fire, forcing her to the cold edge of the camp and reinforcing her status as a "Zenith soft-skin."

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Betrayal for Love. When Brun is captured by a rival tribe, Astrid realizes that Ragnar will not risk the whole warband to save her. She betrays the Warband’s location to the rivals in exchange for Brun’s life.
- **Impact on Ragnar:** Ragnar is forced to execute his own "shield" for treason. The loss of his most loyal guardians shatters his trust in his own tribe, leading to a state of extreme, paranoid isolation.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Sisters" are gone. The remaining warriors no longer feel like a family, but like a group of individuals who are all one mistake away from being executed by their King.

**Event Location:** Book 6, Chapter 22
**Defining Quote:** _"She is a variable. And she has been subtracted."_ — Ragnar

## Consistency Check

| Book 6 | Chapter 23 | Detailed Description | He finds **Astrid**, one of the **Shield-Sisters**—his elite personal guard. She is kneeling before the elders, tears streaming down her face. She has just confessed. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 23 | Detailed Description | He squeezes. _CRACK._ He snaps her neck with clinical efficiency. The **Shield-Sisters** are broken. |
