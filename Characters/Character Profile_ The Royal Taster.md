# Character Profile: The Royal Taster

**Archetype:** The Martyr / The Superior Servant
**True Sin:** PRIDE (She considers her potential death a status symbol that places her above all other subjects).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (She claims her job is the ultimate form of devotion).

## I. Role in the Story

The Royal Taster is a woman whose sole job is to eat the Emperor’s food to check for poison. She is a reminder of the paranoia and fanaticism that surrounds the Throne.

- **The Attitude:** She looks at Angelica with haughty superiority, considering herself more "pure" because of her willingness to die for the Emperor.
- **The Quote:** "I die for him. What do you do?" This question challenges Angelica's worth and reinforces the idea that the court consists only of those who have surrendered their lives to the Emperor.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 30](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md)
- **Defining Quote:** "Left to rot while the hologram ignored her." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: PRIDE/MARTYRDOM FOR NOTHING)

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 1 | Chapter 25 | Dialog | **Headmaster Vane:** "The ratings were the highest in Zenith history. Higher than the execution of the rebel leaders. Higher than the Royal Wedding." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 05 | *The Imperial Shadows | In the corner, the **Royal Taster** samples the buffet with paranoid precision. The **Jeweler** inspects the ladies' diamonds with a loupe, while the **Mirror-Maid** stands silently behind the High Chamberlain, holding a reflective shield so he can check his appearance. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | Silas pushes his entire pile into the center—fleet titles, credits, weapons contracts. He shows a "Void Royal"—an almost unbeatable hand. He grins, reaching for the key. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | Angelica doesn't rely on the hologram. She palms a physical card—an Ace of Spades she marked earlier—and slides it into the reader. The computer registers the physical override. Her hand shifts to a "Dead Man's Hand" (Aces and Eights), which in this variant beats a Royal due to the "Wildcard" rule. |
