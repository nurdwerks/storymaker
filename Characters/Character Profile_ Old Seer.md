# Character Profile: Old Seer

**Archetype:** The Mystic / The Blind Prophet
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Relying on old bones and ancient riddles rather than facing the complicated truth of the present).
**Virtue Mask:** WISDOM (He frames his suspicion of the unknown as "Spiritual Prophecy").

## I. Role in the Story

Old Seer is a blind mystic who throws bones for Ragnar. He is the guardian of the tribe's spiritual fears and their connection to the unseen world.

- **The Prophecy:** He points a finger at Angelica and warns Ragnar to "Beware the Golden Eye," poisoning the King's trust in her.
- **The Authority:** Ragnar trusts the Seer's riddles more than Angelica's logic, showing that in the Warband, the "old ways" of fear will always trump the "new ways" of knowledge.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** False Prophecy / Betrayal. The Seer is caught "faking" a prophecy from the bones to manipulate Ragnar into attacking a specific target that the Seer has a personal grudge against. His holy status is revealed as a fraud.
- **Impact on Ragnar:** Ragnar realizes that for years he has been a puppet of an old man's lies. He doesn't kill the Seer, but he strips him of his authority and leaves him to wander the Silt, lost and forgotten.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Old Ways" are broken. The Warband loses its spiritual core, leading to a state of existential dread as they realize they have no "divine" guidance and are truly alone in a hostile world.

**Event Location:** Book 6, Chapter 18
**Defining Quote:** _"She cured me with dirt. You killed them with lies."_ — Ragnar
