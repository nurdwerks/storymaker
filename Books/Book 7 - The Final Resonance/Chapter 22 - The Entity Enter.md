## Chapter 22: The Entity Enters

### Scene 1: The Manifestation

- **Key Event:** Time seems to suspend. Dust motes stop moving in the air.
- **Key Event:** A geometric shape (a hyper-cube) unfolds in the center of the Bridge. It is made of "Null-Light." Looking at it causes vertigo.

### Scene 2: The Physical Reaction

- **Key Event:** The Zealots drop their weapons. They fall to their knees, weeping. They perceive the Entity as divine awe.
- **Key Event:** Angelica and Kaelen vomit. They perceive it as biological wrongness.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen** — His shadow magic recoils, trying to hide inside his own skin.

### Scene 3: The Silence

- **Key Event:** The sounds of the ship (the engine, the battle outside) vanish. There is only absolute silence.
