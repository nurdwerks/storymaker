### Scene 1: The Scavenge

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Zephyr impact the ground in Sector 4 (the slums), landing in a crater created by Zenith debris.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I think I broke a rib. Add it to the tab."

- **Key Event:** A local scavenger attempts to loot the boots of a dying noble, Lord Vermillion, who tries to command authority based on his title.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Vermillion:** "I am Lord Vermillion! I command you! Do you know who I am? I am a Peer of the Realm!"

### Scene 2: The Kill

- **Key Event:** Ria enters the scene and kills the scavenger by snapping his neck to take the boots for Lisbet.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Efficiently eliminates a scavenger and loots a noble without hesitation, prioritizing the needs of her unit (Lisbet) over social hierarchy.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Put them on. Your soles were worn through."

### Scene 3: The Speech

- **Key Event:** Ria stops Angelica from helping the injured Lord Vermillion, labeling him "dead weight."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Rejects the concept of Zenith charity, viewing it as "noise" and "calorie-negative."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He's noise. He's calorie-negative. We can't carry him. We can't feed him. If you heal him, he just starves slower. Leave him."

### Scene 4: The Law

- **Key Event:** Ria stands on debris and declares a new set of laws for the Undercity: survival depends on utility and caloric intake, not previous rank.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Accepts Ria's logic and steps back from helping the noble, hardening her resolve for the sake of survival.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Zenith laws are for full bellies. Down here, the only law is caloric intake. You work, you eat. You steal, you die."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "There are no seats on the council here, Vance. There is only the food chain. Are you eating, or are you meat?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Morality is a luxury we left upstairs. Move."
