### Scene 1: The Interception

- **Key Event:** The Atmosphere.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Pip:** "I... I didn't mean... he was just..."
- **Key Event:** The Reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen freezes. He looks at his squire. The boy is broken. He looks at the body. Then he looks at Angelica. She is watching them, weapon lowered. She isn't attacking. She looks sad.
- **Key Event:** The Choice.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen makes a choice between Duty and Humanity. He sheathes his sword with a sharp click.

- **Key Event:** The Doubt.

- **Key Event:** The Comment.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "Where...? Who are you? Where is my son?"

- **Key Event:** The Tea.
- **Detailed Description:** They sit in the parlor. Joyce serves them tea. It is hot and healing, dulling their pain instantly.
- **Key Event:** The Truth.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica decides to trust her. She tells Joyce everything. About the Zenith. About the Ship. About Vane's lies.

- **Key Event:** The Confirmation.

- **Key Event:** The Offering.
- **Detailed Description:** She pours more tea.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "But until then... have a biscuit. It's ginger. And just a hint of cyanide for flavor. Good for the digestion."

### Scene 5: The Perimeter

- **Key Event:** Ria secures the safehouse.
- **Detailed Description:** While the team debriefs inside, **Ria (The Iron Vanguard)** takes up position outside, watching the street through the lace curtains. Her Titan armor is dented and scorched, but she keeps her hand on her weapon. Joyce's flower shop may be a clever disguise, but Ria trusts steel more than secrets. She notes the patrol patterns of the City Watch drones, counts the seconds between sweeps, and prepares contingencies. If the Zenith forces find them here, she will buy the others time to escape through whatever back exit Joyce surely has.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (to the room):** "Two-minute gaps between drone sweeps. If we need to run, we go on my signal. Joyce, I assume you have a tunnel?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "Behind the root cellar, dear. It leads to the sewers. I keep it stocked with oxygen masks. The smell is dreadful."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Demonstrates her protective instincts and tactical thinking, always preparing for the worst while others focus on the immediate.
