## Chapter 17: The Paradox

### Scene 1: The Blueprint / Command Hut

- **Key Event:** The oil lamp flickers. Angelica is hunched over a piece of parchment.
- **Key Event:** She is trying to draw the schematic for the Null-Drive. The engine that allows the _Zenith_—and eventually the _Aeterna_—to fold space.
- **Key Event:** She remembers studying it in the Imperial Archives. The "Sacred text of the Architect." The diagram that founded the Zenith civilization.
- **Key Event:** But she can't remember the injector sequence.
- **Key Event:** "Damn it," she swears, crumpling the paper. "I know this. I memorized it."
- **Key Event:** Torin watches her. "Maybe you're overthinking it. Maybe it was simpler."
- **Key Event:** "It wasn't simple!" Angelica snaps. "It was genius. It was perfect. And I can't replicate it."

### Scene 2: The Memory / Command Hut

- **Key Event:** She closes her eyes. She goes into her Mind Palace. The mental library she built to store her memories.
- **Key Event:** She walks the halls of her mind. She finds the memory of the schematic.
- **Key Event:** She zooms in on the parchment in the glass case. The yellowed, ancient paper.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the handwriting. The specific curve of the 'S' in 'Stabilizer'. The ink blot in the corner.
- **Key Event:** Her eyes snap open. She looks at the paper she just crumpled.
- **Key Event:** The ink blot is there. In the exact same spot.
- **Key Event:** The handwriting... is hers.
- **Key Event:** A cold chill runs down her spine.
- **Key Event:** "It wasn't an ancient text," she whispers. "It was this. This piece of paper."
- **Key Event:** She realizes the truth. She didn't learn the engine design from the past. She invented it in the past, so she could learn it in the future, so she could come back and invent it.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes she is the "Architect" she once admired, caught in a causal loop.

### Scene 3: The Signature / Command Hut

- **Key Event:** Her hand shakes.
- **Key Event:** She smooths out the paper. She dips her quill.
- **Key Event:** She draws the injector sequence. Not because she remembers the engineering, but because she remembers the _drawing_.
- **Key Event:** It flows out of her. Perfect. Complete.
- **Key Event:** At the bottom, she hesitates.
- **Key Event:** In the museum, the signature was faded. People debated who it was. "The Architect" was just a title given by the church.
- **Key Event:** She signs it. _A. Ward._
- **Key Event:** She stares at it. In five thousand years, the ink will fade. The name will be lost. But the title will remain.

### Scene 4: The Circle / Outside the Hut

- **Key Event:** She walks outside. She needs air.
- **Key Event:** The night sky spins above her.
- **Key Event:** Torin joins her. "You okay?"
- **Key Event:** "Who wrote the song?" she asks strangely.
- **Key Event:** "What?"
- **Key Event:** "If a time traveler copies a song from the future, goes back, and teaches it to Beethoven... who wrote it? Beethoven didn't. The traveler didn't."
- **Key Event:** Torin frowns. "It has no beginning."
- **Key Event:** "Exactly," Angelica says. "We are stuck in a causal loop, Torin. This ship, my life, the Zenith... it's a snake eating its own tail. There is no beginning. There is only the circle."
- **Key Event:** She feels trapped. Controlled by a destiny she wrote herself but can't change.
- **Key Event:** Torin puts a hand on her shoulder. "Then we spin," he says.
- **Key Event:** "What?"
- **Key Event:** "If we are gears, then at least we are turning together," he says. "And if we build the ship... maybe we can break the clock. Maybe we can fly out of the circle."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at him. It's a comforting thought.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Who wrote the song? ... We are stuck in a causal loop, Torin. ... There is no beginning. There is only the circle."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "If we are gears, then at least we are turning together. And if we build the ship, maybe we can break the clock."
