# Chapter 5: The Span

Angelica braced herself against the gale, her fingers numbing as she gripped the freezing marble edge of the platform. Five thousand feet above the Cloud Layer, the wind was a living, invisible force that tore at her thin tunic and tasted of ozone and ice. She squinted through the stinging salt of her own tears as a sudden gust nearly took her feet out from under her, her vision swimming as she stared into the infinite, churning grey void below.

They stood at the edge of the Induction Spire, looking out at the nightmare Vane had prepared for them: The Span.

It wasn't a bridge—it was a ribbon of transparent poly-glass, barely four feet wide, stretching a mile into the void. It hummed a high-pitched, subsonic tune as it harmonized with the hurricane-force winds, a vibration that rattled Angelica’s teeth.

"Walk or fly," a Warden bellowed, his voice distorted by his helmet’s speakers as he jabbed a shock-baton into a hesitant candidate's ribs. "The choice is yours."

The man screamed as he slipped, his boots squeaking uselessly on the wet glass. Angelica watched, her heart hammering against her ribs, as he clawed at the slick poly-glass before the wind finally snatched him away. The silence that followed his fading scream was heavier than the roar of the air.

Angelica tightened her harness. _Friction coefficient: 0.3. Wind speed: 80 knots. Vectors: North-Northeast._ She stepped onto the glass, her legs feeling like jelly as the transparency made it feel like she was walking on nothing but air. _Don't look down. Fixate on the gold tower. Step. Step. Step._

"Anyone else have a problem with the curriculum?" the Warden asked, his visor reflecting the terrified faces of the remaining forty-nine candidates.

No one spoke. The sound of teeth chattering was the only response.

"Good. Then walk. Formation is irrelevant. Speed is mandatory. If you are not across in thirty minutes, the bridge retracts."

A murmur of terror rippled through the group. _Retracts?_

Angelica swallowed hard. Her throat felt like it was filled with broken glass. She tightened the straps of her tunic. She checked her boots—standard issue Silt-runners, worn tread, terrible grip. They were designed for running on concrete, not ice-slicked glass.

_Physics,_ she told herself, forcing the panic into a box in the back of her mind. _It's just physics. Friction coefficient of wet glass is 0.3. Wind speed is 80 knots, gusting to 100 from the north-northeast. Centre of gravity must be kept low. Vectors. Calculate the vectors._

She stepped onto the glass.

It vibrated. A high-pitched hum traveled up through her soles, rattling her teeth. The bridge was alive, singing in the wind. The resonant frequency of the glass was harmonizing with the gale, creating a subsonic tremble that made her knees weak.

She risked a glance down.

Mistake.

The transparency was perfect. It felt like she was stepping onto air. The vertigo hit her like a hammer blow to the forehead. The world spun. The clouds below seemed to be rushing up to meet her. The horizon tilted. Bile rose in her throat.

_Don't look down. Look forward. Fixate on a point._

She focused on the far tower. A golden spire a mile away. It was a pinprick of stability in a spinning world. _Just walk to the gold. Step. Step. Step._

The group began to move. It was a slow, terrified shuffle. They huddled together instinctively, mimicking the behavior of herd animals in a storm. No one wanted to be on the outside. Everyone pushed toward the center, creating a crushing mass of bodies in the middle of the narrow strip.

"Stop pushing!" someone screamed.

"Move up! You're blocking the path!"

Elaborate cursing filled the air.

Ria, the tall girl from the elevator who had been eyeing everyone like cuts of meat, shoved her way to the front. She was a giantess, built like a blast-door. She didn't walk; she stomped. Her heavy combat boots hammered the glass, cracking the thin layer of ice that had begun to form.

"You idiots are going to get us all killed!" Ria yelled over the wind, turning to face the huddled mass. "If you bunch up like that, one slip takes out ten people! Spread out!"

"Screw you!" the 'Vampire' shouted back. "You want the wind to pick us off one by one?"

"I want to survive, you toothy freak!" Ria snarled. "We need a wedge. The big ones on the outside blocking the wind! Small fry in the middle! It's aerodynamics!"

It was a smart order. Surprisingly smart for someone who looked like she broke rocks for a living.

"Do it!" Jax roared from the back. He moved to the windward side, using his massive bulk to shield a shivering girl. "Bigs on the left! Smalls on the right! Move!"

The group shuffled into formation. It wasn't perfect, but it was better. A wall of muscle formed on the left side, taking the brunt of the gale.

Angelica found herself pushed into the center of the pack, sandwiched between Kaelen Night—the silent boy in the long coat—and a guy with a cybernetic arm that whirred loudly in the cold.

They walked.

The first hundred yards were hell. The wind buffeted them, pushing them toward the edge. Every gust was a battle. Every step was a negotiation with gravity. The glass was slick, treacherous.

Angelica watched Kaelen. He walked with his hands in his pockets. His long coat flapped violently around his legs, but he seemed... anchored. He didn't stumble. He didn't flinch when the wind howled. He moved with a supernatural grace, his steps perfectly placed.

_He's not fighting the wind,_ she realized. _He's moving through it._

Then they hit the halfway point.

The Halfway Mark was where the wind changed. The aerodynamics of the spires funneled the air currents into a vortex. The steady gale became a chaotic, swirling hurricane. The sound changed from a roar to a scream.

"Brace!" Ria screamed, her voice barely audible.

A gust hit them from the side, distinct and solid as a physical wall. It wasn't just air; it felt like a giant hand slapping them toward the abyss.

The wedge broke.

People stumbled. The formation shattered. The wall of muscle on the left buckled. Jax went down to one knee, digging his fingers into a seam in the glass to keep from sliding.

Angelica was thrown sideways. She slammed into Kaelen, bouncing off his heavy coat. He didn't move—he stood like a statue rooted to the ground—but she lost her footing.

She slid.

For a terrifying second, she was skating on the glass. She windmilled her arms, fighting for balance. Her boots scrambled for purchase, finding only smooth, wet surface.

She regained it, gasping, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. She was near the edge. Two feet from the drop.

She looked up.

Ria was there.

The big girl towered over her, her face twisted in annoyance. She wasn't scared; she was irritated. She looked at Angelica like she was a piece of gum stuck to her boot.

"You're slowing us down, twigs," Ria shouted, her voice barely audible over the roar. "Keep your feet planted! Dig in!"

"I'm pacing myself!" Angelica yelled back, her voice thin and reedy, snatched away by the wind. "The wind shear is variable! I'm adjusting for gusts!"

"Pace this," Ria snarled. "We have ten minutes before the bridge retracts. I'm not dying because you can't walk."

It happened fast. Too fast for anyone else to see.

Ria checked her hip. It looked like a stumble, a reaction to the wind. But it was a check. A calculated, brutal shove.

Her hip slammed into Angelica’s shoulder.

Note: Mass times acceleration equals force. Ria weighed two hundred pounds of muscle and bone density. Angelica weighed one hundred soaking wet.

The physics were undeniable.

Angelica flew.

Her boots lost traction completely. She slid across the wet glass.

She reached out. Her fingers brushed the edge. She felt the cold smoothness of the corner. She tried to grab it.

But wet glass offers no grip.

And then she was falling.

The wind roared in her ears, a deafening white noise that stole her breath and ripped the scream from her throat before it could form.

She saw the bridge receding above her, a thin, fragile line of light against the oppressive grey sky. She saw the faces of the other candidates peering over the edge—blurred ovals of pale shock. She saw Ria's face, clear and sharp, twisted in a cold grimace of satisfaction.

_She pushed me,_ Angelica thought. The realization wasn't emotional. It was a data point.

She didn't scream. Screaming was a waste of oxygen. Screaming changed nothing.

Her mind, trained in the brutal logic of survival, didn't panic. It engaged. It sat up and took notes on her own death.

_Freefall initiated. Vertical velocity increasing at 9.8 meters per second squared. Air resistance is negligible at this altitude due to thin atmosphere._

She twisted her body in the air, wind-milling her arms, trying to orient herself face-down.

_Trajectory: Vertical. Drift: 12 meters South due to crosswind._
_Time to cloud layer impact: 4 seconds._
_Time to ground impact: 14 seconds._
_Survival Probability: 0.00000%_

She looked down.

The clouds were rushing up to meet her. They looked soft, like a bed of grey feathers. But she knew the truth. They were just water vapor. Below them was the city. The spires. The hard, unforgiving concrete of the Silt.

_So this is it,_ she thought, a strange, crystalline calm washing over her. The fear was gone, replaced by a cold acceptance. _I calculated the odds. I knew the variables. I accounted for the wind, the ice, the fatigue. I just didn't account for the human element._

_Variable X: Betrayal._

She closed her eyes. She imagined leo. She hoped the medicine had worked. She hoped he would be okay.

_I'm sorry, Leo. I did the math wrong._

She waited for the end.

Then, the world stopped.

It wasn't an impact. It wasn't the ground.

It was a snatch.

Something cold—colder than the wind, colder than the void—wrapped around her waist. It slammed into her with the force of a car crash, squeezing the air from her lungs in a painful _whoosh._

She jerked to a halt in mid-air. The sudden deceleration nearly snapped her spine. Gravity fought for her, pulling down, but the thing holding her pulled back harder.

She snapped her eyes open.

She wasn't falling. She was hanging. Dangling like a puppet on a string, twenty feet below the bridge.

She looked up.

A shadow.

A literal shadow was holding her.

It extended from the bridge above, a long, shivering tendril of darkness that defied the sun. It was anchored to the underside of the glass, and at the end of it, hanging upside down, was a shape.

It wasn't just a blob of dark. It had form. It had anatomy. It looked like a humanoid figure made of spilled ink and nightmares. It had ragged, bat-like wings that beat silently against the air. It had claws that were wrapped tight around her waist.

And it had eyes. Two burning white slits in a faceless head.

_Umbra._ The word floated into her mind, unbidden.

The creature hissed—a sound like tearing paper. It was solid. She could feel the icy pressure of its grip through her tunic. It wasn't just magic; it was matter. Dark matter.

"Going up," a voice whispered in her mind. It wasn't the shadow speaking; the voice was dry, bored, and human. It was a projection of thought.

The shadow retracted.

It pulled her up. Not slowly. Violently. It yanked her against gravity with a strength that terrified her. It was like being reeled in by a giant fisherman.

She flew back up toward the bridge. The wind shrieked in protest.

She cleared the edge. The shadow swung her inward, its claws retracting, and dumped her onto the glass.

Angelica hit the deck hard, rolling to absorb the impact. She slammed into the railing-less edge, her boots skidding on the ice, but she scrambled to her hands and knees, gasping, coughing, shaking.

She looked up.

Kaelen Night stood over her.

He hadn't moved. He was standing exactly where she had last seen him. His long black coat hung motionless around him, seemingly unaffected by the wind that was tearing at everyone else. His hands were in his pockets. His posture was relaxed, almost lazy.

But his shadow...

His shadow didn't match his body.

On the glass, his shadow was a pool of writhing ink. It was retracting, pulling itself back from the edge like a living fluid, reshaping itself until it looked like a normal shadow again. But for a second, Angelica saw faces in it. Screaming faces pressing against the surface of the dark.

The group backed away from him. Even Ria took a step back, her face pale, her eyes wide with a new kind of fear. This wasn't physical intimidation. This was primal dread.

Kaelen sighed. It was the sigh of someone interrupted in the middle of a good book.

He took a hand out of his pocket. He was holding a small, obsidian knife. The blade was jagged, inscribed with glowing red runes that pulsed with a hungry, rhythmic light. _Thump-thump. Thump-thump._

He held his left hand out over the glass.

He sliced his own palm.

It was a quick, precise cut. A ritual motion.

The blood welled up, dark and thick. It looked heavy, like mercury.

It didn't drip. It didn't stain the glass.

It boiled.

The moment the blood hit the air, it hissed. Red steam rose from the wound. The blood evaporated into thick, black smoke that didn't disperse in the wind. Instead, it swirled down, sucked instantly into his shadow at his feet.

The shadow pulsed. It grew darker, deeper, more solid. It seemed to lap at the smoke like a starving dog.

_The Blood Price,_ Angelica realized, the knowledge hitting her with the force of a revelation. _Magic isn't free. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. He defied gravity. He spent energy. Now he has to pay the debt._

She stared at the wound in his hand. It was already clotting, the magic reacting to seal the breach, the skin knitting together with unnatural speed.

"You're bleeding," she whispered, her voice trembling. "You cut yourself."

Kaelen looked at her. His eyes were dark, completely black, devoid of the white sclera for a long, terrifying second. Then the white returned, creeping back in from the edges.

"Observation: Accurate," he droned, his voice devoid of emotion. "Utility: Zero."

He wiped the blade on his coat, leaving no stain, and sheathed it in a hidden fold of the leather.

"Do not make me spend my blood on you again, Ward," he said, his voice cold and flat. "It is expensive. The exchange rate is poor, and I am not a charity."

Angelica blinked, staring at the sheath where the knife had disappeared. Her mind was reeling, trying to reconcile the data. Shadow monsters. Boiling blood. Calculated altruism.

"Why?" she asked again, scrambling to her feet. The wind nearly knocked her over, but she grabbed Kaelen's sleeve—then immediately let go, fearing he might cut her hand off. "You don't know me. I'm... I'm a rat from Sector 12. You're... whatever you are. Why risk the entropy loss?"

She used the scientific term for energy loss. She saw Kaelen’s eyebrow twitch. A micro-expression of surprise? Or just annoyance?

"Risk assessment," Kaelen said, turning his back to the wind. "If you fell, your screaming would have alerted the sensors on the pylons. The bridge would have retracted for a safety check. We would all be stranded here for another hour. I do not have the patience for an hour of wind."

It was a lie. A beautiful, logical lie. But a lie nonetheless.

"Aw, isn't that sweet," a voice grated.

Ria stepped forward. She had recovered from her momentary terror. The shadow was gone, and with it, her fear. She was big, she was mean, and she was embarrassed. Embarrassment in the Silt usually led to violence.

"Looks like Night found a pet," she sneered, looking between them. "Going to keep it on a leash, freak? Maybe put a little collar on it?"

She looked at Angelica with pure venom. "You should have stayed down, Runt. Gravity was doing you a favor."

Angelica stepped back, her hand going to the knife she didn't have.

Kaelen didn't step back. He turned his head slowly. The movement was mechanical, precise. He looked at Ria not with anger, but with the detached interest of an entomologist looking at a cockroach.

"Dialogue: Tedious," he muttered.

"What did you say to me?" Ria roared, stepping closer. She towered over him by four inches. She balled her fists, huge ham-hocks of scarred knuckle. "You think because you know a magic trick you're tough? I've broken mages before. You bleed just like the rest of us."

"Correction," Kaelen said softly. "I do not bleed like you."

He took a step toward her.

"I bleed with purpose."

The shadow at his feet rippled. It didn't explode this time. It seeped. It flowed out across the glass like spilled oil, ignoring the wind. It moved fast, impossibly fast.

Before Ria could blink, the shadow touched her boots.

She froze.

"Don't moved," Kaelen advised. "My shadow is... hungry. If you step on it, it might take it as an invitation to bite."

Ria looked down. The shadow was circling her boots. And in the darkness of the ink, something moved. Teeth? Claws? It was impossible to tell, but the feeling of _predator_ radiating from the floor was overwhelming.

"Get it off me!" she shrieked, dancing in place, terrified to lift her feet but terrified to keep them down.

"Apologize," Kaelen said.

"What?"

"Apologize to the variable you attempted to subtract." He pointed a gloved finger at Angelica. "She is part of the equation now. If you disrupt the equation again, I will remove you from the set. Permanently."

Ria looked at Angelica. The hate was still there, burning hot, but the fear was colder.

"I'm sorry," she spat. It wasn't sincere, but it was submission.

Kaelen snapped his fingers. The shadow retracted instantly, snapping back to his heels like a trained dog.

"Accepted. Now walk. Before I lose interest and let gravity finish what you started."

He turned and began to walk. The wind parted around him as if afraid to touch him. He didn't look back to see if they were following. He knew they were.

Angelica scrambled to catch up. She fell in step beside him, sticking to his leeward side, using his unnatural stability as a shield against the wind.

"Thank you," she said quietly.

He didn't answer. He just kept walking, his eyes fixed on the golden spire ahead.

The rest of the walk was a blur of misery.

The adrenaline faded, leaving Angelica with the cold. It seeped into her bones. Her fingers were numb. Her nose felt like a block of ice. Every step was a battle against the vibration of the glass and the screaming wind.

But she walked differently now. She wasn't just surviving. She was observing.

She watched Kaelen. She watched the way he moved. She watched the way his shadow seemed to anticipate the gusts, shifting its weight to counterbalance him. _He's not just a mage,_ she realized. _He's a system. A resonant system. He and the shadow are connected._

They passed the three-quarter mark.

The Main Academy tower loomed above them now. It was colossal. A mountain of white stone and glass that pierced the clouds. The Golden Spire wasn't just a decoration; it was an antenna, humming with energy.

But the bridge didn't end.

As they neared the tower, the wind shifted. It wasn't just a crosswind anymore; it was a downdraft. The sheer face of the tower acted as a sail, catching the wind and funneling it straight down onto the bridge.

"Heads down!" Jax roared, shielding his face.

The candidates bent double, fighting to stay upright against the crushing pressure of the air. It felt like walking through invisible molasses.

And then, they saw the end.

The glass widened into a small platform, perhaps twenty feet square, right against the hull of the tower. A massive blast door, etched with the symbol of the Zenith, stood closed.

Closed.

A red light pulsed above it.

"It's shut!" someone screamed. "Why is it shut?"

The front of the group reached the platform and collapsed, gasping for breath. But there was no relief. The platform was exposed. The wind here was turbulent, swirling in tight, violent eddies that threatened to pick them up and toss them over the railing-less edge.

"Open the door!" a girl pounded on the metal. "Open it! We're freezing!"

Nothing happened. The red light just pulsed. _Thump. Thump._ Like a slow heartbeat.

Angelica reached the platform and wedged herself into a corner between a support strut and the wall. It offered a few inches of shelter from the wind. Kaelen stood nearby, his back to the wall, his coat flapping but his expression bored.

"Why aren't they opening it?" the 'Vampire'—a gaunt boy with sharpened teeth—hissed. He was shivering so hard his teeth were clicking together. "We're here. We made it."

Angelica checked her internal clock. "We're early."

The Vampire looked at her, his eyes wild. "Early?"

"Vane said we had thirty minutes," she said, her voice numb. "We crossed in twenty-two. Efficiency."

"So?"

"So, the schedule is the schedule," Kaelen cut in, not looking at them. "The Zenith does not reward efficiency with comfort. They reward it with... this."

"This?"

"Waiting," Angelica finished. "The test wasn't just the walk. It's the wait. Can you hold it together when you think you're safe, but you're not?"

The crowd was starting to fray. The relief of reaching the end had evaporated, replaced by a desperate, claustrophobic panic. Fifty people were crammed onto a small square of glass, thousands of feet in the air, freezing to death while a warm light glowed mockingly from the door controls.

"I'm not waiting!" the Vampire snarled. He pushed his way toward the door panel. "I can hotwire it. I know tech. I'm from the Scrapyards."

"Don't," Angelica warned. "It's a trap."

"Shut up, Silt-Rat!"

He reached for the panel. He pulled a small, improvised pry-bar from his sleeve.

He jammed it into the seam of the control box.

_ZAP._

A blue arc of electricity—the same color as the Wardens' batons but ten times thicker—leaped from the panel. It hit the pry-bar, traveled up his arm, and slammed into his chest.

The Vampire flew backward.

He didn't scream. His muscles locked up instantly. He hit the crowd, bowling over two other candidates. He landed on the glass, twitching, smoke rising from his jacket.

The smell of ozone and burnt hair filled the small space.

"Back away!" Jax shouted, shoving people back from the door. "Nobody touches the door!"

The crowd recoiled, pressing back toward the edge of the platform.

Angelica looked at the Vampire. He was breathing—shallow, ragged gasps—but he was out cold.

"Negative reinforcement," Kaelen noted. "Predictable."

"They want us to break," Angelica whispered. She looked at the shivering mass of people. Some were crying. Some were cursing. One girl was curled into a ball, rocking back and forth.

_They're measuring our breaking point._

She looked up at the red light. It pulsed.

_One minute... two minutes..._

The cold was digging deeper. Angelica couldn't feel her toes. She started to do mental arithmetic to keep her brain warm. _Powers of two. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048..._

She got to _65,536_ before the light changed.

It turned green.

A heavy pneumatic hiss cut through the wind. The blast doors groaned.

The crowd surged forward.

"Wait!" Jax bellowed, holding them back. "Let it open!"

The doors parted slowly, revealing a warm, golden light. Heat—glorious, dry heat—spilled out onto the platform.

It wasn't just heat. It was the smell of food. Roasted meat. Fresh bread.

_Psychological warfare,_ Angelica thought. _Freeze them, then tempt them._

The crowd broke. They stampeded.

Angelica didn't run. She peeled herself off the wall, her joints stiff. Kaelen acted as her shield again, walking calmly into the chaos, his mere presence parting the way.

They stepped off the glass and onto solid, heated titanium plating.

The feeling of stability was intoxicating. Angelica nearly collapsed. Her knees buckled, her legs turning to jelly now that the threat was gone.

She staggered, catching herself on a wall. The wall was warm. She pressed her face against it, soaking up the heat, shivering violently as her body realized it was safe.

They were inside.

The Induction Hall was cavernous. The ceiling was vaulting, lost in shadows, supported by pillars thick enough to drive a tank through. The air was warm and smelled of ozone and recycled pine scent—a jarringly artificial attempt at comfort.

But it was the statues that dominated the room.

Along the walls, looming thirty feet high, stood the Effigies of the Ascended. These were the winners of previous Iron Selections. They weren't carved from stone; they were cast from the melted down weapons of their defeated enemies.

To the left stood _General Kael_, Victor of the 42nd Selection. He was encased in primitive power armor, holding a severed head in one hand and a flag in the other. The plaque beneath him read: _STRENGTH IS ABSOLUTE._

To the right was _Matriarch Vex_, Victor of the 59th. She wore no armor, only a flowing robe. One hand was outstretched, palm open; the other was hidden behind her back, clutching a dagger. Her face was a mask of beautiful deceit. Her plaque read: _TRUST IS A WEAPON._

And in the center, directly above the heavy blast doors they had just entered, was the most terrifying of all.

_The Founder._

He had no name recorded on the plaque. Just a title. _THE ARCHITECT._ He wore a simple suit, utilitarian and plain. But his eyes—even in statutes—seemed to follow them. He wasn't holding a weapon. He was holding a book. The plaque read: _KNOWLEDGE APPLIED IS POWER UNLEASHED._

"Move it!" a fresh squad of Wardens shouted, their voices echoing in the vast space. "Processing! To the left! Medical checks! To the right! If you are bleeding, go right! If you are dying, go outside!"

Jax dragged the unconscious Vampire—or what was left of him—into the hall. The boy was groaning, his eyes fluttering open.

"Drop him," a Warden commanded, pointing a baton at Jax.

"He's alive," Jax grunted, not letting go. "He survived the door."

"He failed the intelligence test," the Warden sneered. "Leave him. The Med-Drones will scrap him for parts if he doesn't walk in five minutes."

Jax hesitated, then dropped the boy. The Vampire hit the floor with a thud, coughing smoke.

"Walk!" the Warden shouted.

Kaelen stopped. He adjusted his coat, smoothing a wrinkle that wasn't there. He looked up at the statue of the Architect, then down at the chaos around him.

He looked down at Angelica. His eyes swept over her, cataloging the bruises, the wind-burn, and the steady rhythm of her breathing. He wasn't looking at a person; he was looking at a potentially useful tool that had just passed a quality control test.

"Your debt is unpaid, Ward," he said, his voice low enough to be lost under the shouting of the Wardens, but perfectly audible to her.

"I'll pay it," she said, surprising herself with the conviction in her voice. "I calculate my debts. I always pay."

Kaelen tilted his head. A small, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. It wasn't a nice smile. It was the smile of a banker who just approved a high-interest loan.

"Good. Because the interest rate is variable. And it compounds daily."

He turned and walked away, disappearing into the crowd of shivering candidates.

Angelica watched him go. Then she looked down at her hands. They were shaking. Not from cold. From excitement.

_I survived,_ she thought. _And I found a variable that defies the standard model._

She smiled. A sharp, dangerous smile.

_Let's see what else I can break._

---

High above, in the deep archives of the Zenith, a man sat in a room lined with leather-bound books and ancient artifacts.

The room smelled of old paper, dust, and power. It was a stark contrast to the sterile white corruption of Vane's spires. This was a place of history. A place of secrets.

Lord Cromwell.

He was an old man, or perhaps he just wore age like a costume. His skin was like parchment, thin and dry, stretched over sharp bones. He wore a suit of dark velvet that swallowed the light.

He was watching a holographic projection on his desk. It showed the feed from the Span.

He adjusted his monocle—a piece of technology disguised as an antique—and rewound the footage.

_Play._

He watched the push. He watched the fall. The terror in the girl's eyes.

_Pause._

He zoomed in on the shadow.

"Beautiful," he whispered. His voice was like dry leaves skittering on stone.

He watched the shadow detach itself from the glass. He watched the manifestation of the entity—Umbra. The claws. The wings. The raw, entropic hunger of it.

_Play._

The rescue. The lift. The defying of gravity.

_Pause._

He zoomed in on Kaelen's hand. The knife. The blood. The smoke.

"Blood for gravity," Cromwell mused, leaning back in his chair. "An interesting exchange rate. Most mages would have used kinetic force. Clean. Simple. But he used Shadow. He used Entropy."

He picked up a fountain pen. It was a real fountain pen, with a gold nib and a reservoir of real ink. He opened a leather-bound journal. The pages were filled with handwritten notes in a precise, archaic script.

He wrote: _Subject: Kaelen Night. Class: Shadow-Mage. Resonance Level: High. Control: Brittle._

He tapped the pen against his chin, leaving a small dot of ink on his skin.

"The boy has discipline," he muttered to the empty room. "But his control is hanging by a thread. He feeds the darkness to control it, but the darkness is hungry. It eats from the inside out."

He glanced at the girl on the screen—Angelica Ward—scrambling to keep up with the mage.

"And the girl..." Cromwell frowned. "Why save her? Altruism? Unlikely. Investment? Maybe."

He watched her interactions. The way she checked her datapad. The way she scanned the bridge. The way she had analyzed Jax in the elevator.

"She sees the systems," Cromwell noted, leaning forward. "She isn't a warrior. She's an engineer. A deconstructionist."

He made another note, underlining it twice.

_Monitor connection between Subject Night and Subject Ward. Potential leverage. Subject Ward possesses 'The Eye'._

He closed the book with a heavy thud.

He stood up and walked to the window. From here, he could see the entire Academy. The training grounds. The arenas. The dormitories.

It was a chessboard. And Vane was playing a clumsy game of checkers.

"Let Vane have his soldiers," Cromwell whispered, placing his hand against the glass. "Let him breed his killers and his tanks. I will take the shadows. I will take the ones who look at the board and see the strings."

He looked down at the Span, a tiny thread of glass in the distance.

"If he breaks," Cromwell said softly, referring to Kaelen, "he will swallow the entire Academy in darkness. And I..."

He smiled. It was a smile full of teeth.

"...I will be there to catch the pieces."

He turned his gaze from the Span to the massive structure dominating the central courtyard. The Assembly Hall.

Even from this height, he could sense the vibration of the crowd. Thousands of them. Fresh meat for the grinder. They would be standing in rows right now, shivering in the cold, waiting for Vane to tell them who they were.

"Enjoy the spectacle, children," Cromwell whispered, turning away from the window as the lights in his office dimmed. "Class is about to begin."

# End of Chapter 5
