### Scene 1: The Vector (The Needle's Eye)

- **Key Event:** Navigator Starla plots the final approach vector through the enemy blockade.
- **Detailed Description:** The bridge of the _Aeterna_ is a hive of activity. Red emergency lights bathe the room in blood-colored shadows. Navigator Starla sits at the helm, her hands dancing over the holographic interface. On the main viewscreen, the enemy fleet—hundreds of black needle-ships—forms a dense web blocking the path to the temporal rift. The rift itself pulses with blue Cherenkov radiation, a beacon of escape in the void. Starla's face is slick with sweat as she calculates the only possible trajectory: a suicidal run straight through the center of the enemy formation.
- **Internal Conflict:** Starla feels the weight of thousands of lives on her fingertips. One wrong digit, one millisecond of hesitation, and the ship will be atomized. She shuts out the fear, focusing entirely on the math. The equations are her shield against the terror.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Navigator Starla** — Her calculations will determine whether they live or die. She demonstrates absolute professional focus under catastrophic pressure.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Navigator Starla:** "I can get us through, but the timing has to be perfect. Three-second window. If we miss it, the gravity shear tears us apart."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Thread the needle, Starla. We're right behind you."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "The civilians are secured in the lower decks, Captain. Panic is rising, but I've deployed the stewards to maintain order. We are ready."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Thank you, Corinne. Keep them calm. Tell them... tell them we're going home."

### Scene 2: The Flash (Starla's Sacrifice)

- **Key Event:** An enemy weapon detonates near the bridge, blinding Navigator Starla.
- **Detailed Description:** The enemy flagship fires a high-yield plasma torpedo. It detonates just off the starboard bow, overloading the ship's external sensors and flooding the bridge with blinding white light. The blast shields fail for a microsecond. Starla, staring directly at the navigation feed, screams. The intense radiation sears her retinas. She falls back in her chair, clutching her eyes, as the smell of ozone and burnt hair fills the air. Lady Corinne rushes to her side, her silk robes dragging in the dust, her hands steady as she checks Starla's vitals, but the damage is done.
- **Internal Conflict:** Pain overwhelms her, but the panic is worse. She is blind. The ship is flying blind at a significant fraction of light speed. But in the darkness, she sees the afterimage of the vector—a burning blue line in her mind.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Navigator Starla** — Even blinded and in agony, she refuses to relinquish her post. She realizes she has memorized the route.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Navigator Starla:** "I can't see! My eyes... they're gone!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Medic! Get a medic up here!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "I have her, Captain! Stay focusing on the helm! Breathe, Starla. I am here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Navigator Starla:** "No time! I know the path! Thirty degrees starboard, NOW! Don't wait for the computer!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Do it! Trust her!"

### Scene 3: The Sabotage (Engine Room)

- **Key Event:** An explosion rocks the engine room.
- **Detailed Description:** Deep in the bowels of the ship, alarms blare. A shaped charge has detonated on the primary coolant line. Superheated steam vents into the engineering bay, scalding the air. Kaelen and Ria rush into the chaos, finding the body of Intern Oakhart lying near the blast site. He is dead, shrapnel embedded in his chest, clutching a detonator in his stiff hand.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen stares at the body. Oakhart was quiet, diligent. Was he a traitor working for Vane? Or a victim, framed and murdered to cover the real saboteur's tracks? The ambiguity gnaws at him. There is no time for an investigation.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Oakhart's body is here. The charges were on a timer. He's holding the trigger."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Was he the traitor or the victim? Did he plant it, or did someone plant him?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Does it matter now? We're leaking coolant. If the core goes critical, we're just expensive fireworks. Fix the engine!"

- **Key Event:** Zephyr and Ria patch the coolant leak.
- **Detailed Description:** Working in the scalding steam, Zephyr uses his cybernetic arm to manually crank the emergency shut-off valve, the metal glowing red with heat. Ria welds a patch over the rupture, sparks flying around her face. They work in perfect, wordless synchronization, a testament to their years of survival together.

### Scene 4: The Breakthrough (Into the Rift)

- **Key Event:** With Starla navigating from memory, the ship pushes through the enemy line.
- **Detailed Description:** On the bridge, Starla is a statue of concentration, tears of pain streaming down her face from her ruined eyes. She calls out course corrections steadily. "Three degrees port. Pitch down two. Accelerate." Angelica relays the orders to the helm. Outside, the _Aeterna_ weaves through the barrage of enemy fire, rolling and diving like a fighter jet rather than a capital ship. The blue light of the time rift grows brighter, filling the viewscreen until it swallows the stars.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica watches the screen, holding her breath. She puts her hand on Starla's shoulder, a silent promise of support. They are betting everything on the memory of a blinded woman.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Navigator Starla:** "Almost there. I can feel the gravity well. Hold course. Hold... NOW!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "All power to engines! Punch it!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **System Voice:** "Temporal Shear detected. Transition in 3... 2... 1..."

- **Key Event:** The ship enters the rift.
- **Detailed Description:** The universe stretches. The stars streak into lines of infinite length. A sensation of falling backwards hits the crew. The enemy fleet vanishes, left behind in the present as the _Aeterna_ tears itself out of the timeline. Silence falls on the bridge as the shaking stops. They are in the stream.
- **Internal Conflict:** The crew looks around, dazed. They made it. But the cost was high. Starla will never see the world she saved.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Navigator Starla** — She slumps in her chair, the adrenaline fading, leaving only the darkness.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We're through. Starla... you did it."
