  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Punch it!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **AI:** "Containment coils at 100%. Reality threshold reached."

- **Key Event:** The Tear opens—a jagged wound in reality that is blinding and white—defying all known laws of physics.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Commits the ship to the void, driving them "off the cliff" without looking back.
