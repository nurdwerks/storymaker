# Character Profile: Rose & Lily

**Archetype:** The Sycophants / The Living Accessories
**True Sin:** SLOTH (They have surrendered their individual identities to become extensions of another).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (They claim their mimicry is devotion).

## I. Role in the Story

Rose and Lily are genetically modified twins designed to be "perfect" but secondary to Lady Corinne's beauty. They are biological ornaments whose primary purpose is to validate Corinne's existence.

- **The Function:** They perform the manual labor of Corinne's vanity—brushing her hair, feeding her grapes, and ensuring her comfort—while simultaneously serving as a "wall of giggling judgment."
- **The Behavior:** They echo Corinne’s every emotion. If Corinne scowls at Angelica, they scowl; if she laughs, they giggle. This constant reinforcement creates a distorted reality where only Corinne's opinions have weight.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Psychological Trauma / Separation. During a high-stakes escape, Lily is left behind to slow down pursuers while Rose escapes with Corinne. The "symbiotic" bond is severed, leaving both twins incomplete and mentally shattered.
- **Impact on Lady Corinne:** Corinne views the loss as she would a lost earring—annoying and inconvenient. She forces Rose to continue her duties alone, ignoring Rose's visible mental decline.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "wall of giggling judgment" is broken. Rose becomes a silent, weeping figure, her presence now a source of discomfort and a reminder of the court's cold indifference to sacrifice.

## III. Narrative Integration

- **Event Location:** [Book 4, Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%204_%20The%20Stone%20Season%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L631-L632)
- **Defining Quote from Lady Corinne:** "Don't look at me like that, Rose. Lily was a choice, and I chose survival. You should be grateful you're still worth the effort to drag along. Stop that weeping; it's bad for the complexion."
