# Character Profile: Quartermaster Flint

**Archetype:** The Old War Buddy / The Grumpy Veteran
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Refusal to adapt to new people or ideas; he is stuck in the military past).
**Virtue Mask:** REALISM (He claims his hostility is just "Logistics").

## I. Role in the Story

Quartermaster Flint is an old war buddy of General Ironwood who now manages the legion’s logistics. He represents the old guard who view any civilian as a "liability."

- **The History:** He and Ironwood share stories of campaigns from twenty years ago, using their shared past to lock Angelica out of any conversation.
- **The Liability:** He treats Angelica as a drag on his supply lines. When she enters the room, the stories stop, and the silence is deafening—a physical reminder that she does not belong in their brotherhood.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 26: The Forging of Wrath](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2050-2070)
- **Defining Quote:** "I didn't sign up for slaughter, General." (Reveals flaw: SLOTH/OLD GUARD CONSCIENCE)

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 1 | Chapter 25 | Detailed Description | Vane leans down, his mask inches from Angelica's face. She sees her own reflection in the silver. She looks terrifying. Her eyes are hard, cold flint. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 05 | Detailed Description | Up close, Angelica sees the details. He wears a vest made of untreated, stiff leather. The pockets are filled with tools—bone wrenches, flint drills, coils of vine, and dried herbs. He smells of earth and medicinal plants. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 15 | Detailed Description | The riverbank is shrouded in morning mist. Freya kneels in the mud, humming a melody as she digs for the red clay needed to line the new blast furnace. The silence of the jungle is broken not by a roar, but by a high-pitched mechanical whine. Three Hunter-Scouts, clad in sleek, vacuum-sealed stealth suits that shimmer like oil on water, drop from the canopy. They move with unnatural, jerky speed. The two young hunters, armed only with flint spears, are dead before they can scream—their chests pierced by silent, needle-thin projectiles. Freya tries to run, but a bola made of mono-filament wire wraps around her legs, slicing into her skin and bringing her down. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 20 | Detailed Description | The resistance base is a hollowed-out asteroid, spinning in the shadow of a gas giant. Inside, the air is thin and smells of ozone and unwashed bodies. Zephyr sits behind a desk made of crates. He is surrounded by dataslates, ration packs, and weapon parts. He is the Quartermaster, the man who keeps the war machine running on fumes. A line of soldiers waits for supplies. Zephyr denies a request for extra plasma cells. He explains, with tired patience, that they don't have them. He counts bullets like a miser counts gold. |
