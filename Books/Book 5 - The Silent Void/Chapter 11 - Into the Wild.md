### Scene 1: Sector X Entrance

- **Key Event:** The survivors force open the rusted bulkhead to Sector X (the bio-dome) and enter a hyper-evolved, aggressive jungle that has grown unchecked for five centuries.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **General Ironwood** — Proposes burning the jungle to create "kill boxes," which is immediately rejected by Hatcher because the plants provide oxygen.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Nature didn't wait for us."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I hate nature. Give me concrete any day. Concrete doesn't try to eat you."

- **Key Event:** The group realizes the plants in Sector X are harder than concrete and genetically weaponized, making the environment hostile and unpredictable.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Fascinated by the "impossible" growth rates and aggressive motility of the vegetation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "This isn't natural evolution. This is accelerated."
