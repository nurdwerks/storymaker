# Character Profile: Intern Oakhart

**Archetype:** The Eager Acolyte / The Spy
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for Aris's approval and for a seat at the table of power).
**Virtue Mask:** INNOCENCE (He plays the part of the helpful, friendly assistant to gain trust).

## I. Role in the Story

Intern Oakhart is a young, seemingly friendly assistant who brings Angelica food and "checks in" on her. He is actually a spy reporting her every word back to Aris.

- **The Betrayal:** His friendly face is a mask. Angelica eventually discovers his reports, realizing that even the one person who seemed "kind" was just another tool of the Research Team.
- **The Sting:** This betrayal is a major turning point for Angelica, teaching her that in Aris's world, trust is a liability.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Absolute Betrayal / Death. Oakhart’s role as a spy is discovered by a rival research group. To protect Aris’s secrets, Oakhart is "discontinued"—his clearance is revoked, and his localized server is purged while he is still connected.
- **Impact on Dr. Aris:** Aris doesn't mourn the boy. He simply notes the "loss of a valuable information channel" and moves on to the next intern. This cold dismissal is the final proof for the remaining team that they are all expendable variables.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Friendly Face" is gone. The researchers stop trying to "befriend" the subjects and become as cold and transactional as Aris himself, turning the research team into a group of hollow, professional operatives.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 6 | Chapter 32 | Key Event | An explosion rocks the engine room. Someone has sabotaged the ship. Intern Oakhart is found dead near the detonation point—framed or guilty, no one can tell. |
