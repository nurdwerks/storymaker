## Chapter 12: The Blood Pact

### Scene 1: The Summoning

- **Key Event:** Angelica is brought to House Night Private Quarters—Gothic architecture with floating silver candelabras, blue flames, and obsidian floors. She feels filthy in Squad Iron fatigues.

- **Key Event:** Shadow-Bound guards with smoke masks flank her. A door carved with House Night sigil (crescent moon impaling a sun) opens silently.

### Scene 2: The Interrogation

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night sits reading a real paper book bound in dragon-hide. The room's pressure feels doubled—Angelica's defiance dies in her throat.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You are a chaotic variable, Miss Vance."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen lists her anomalies: bonding an Entropy Feeder, channeling raw resonance without a focus, hacking the Guild archive.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I cannot allow bombs to exist in my vicinity unless I hold the detonator."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I'm just trying to survive."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Survival is messy. I require order. And you are disrupting my ecosystem."

---

### Scene 3: The Bind

- **Key Event:** Kaelen produces a Sanguine Quill (jet black feather with ruby tip) and begins carving intricate symbols onto his own wrist with blood as ink.

- **Key Event:** As Kaelen carves on himself, lines of fire erupt on Angelica's wrist—the Blood Pact binds them through shared pain.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "What are you doing?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Establishing a link. Pain is the authentication key. If you can't feel it, you aren't bound."

---

### Scene 4: The Terms

- **Key Event:** Kaelen finishes the Silence rune. A silver scar forms on Angelica's wrist, identical to his.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen explains the terms: Angelica is now an asset of House Night under his jurisdiction. The mark provides protection from the Artificer Guild.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "This is slavery."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It is protection. Without my mark, the Artificer Guild would have dissected you by noon tomorrow."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen explains the penalties: speaking of what happens here makes the ink burn; betrayal makes it boil; removing the mark stops the heart.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I will allow you to exist, Vance. I will allow you to play your little games with the Gryphon. But never forget who holds the leash."

- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the scar. To her mechanic's eye, it looks like a shackle—but also like a circuit. And circuits can be rewired.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "You didn't have to cut me."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You are a chaotic variable. I am containing you. Be grateful I didn't simply erase you."
