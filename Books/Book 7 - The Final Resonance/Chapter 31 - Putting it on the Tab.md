## Chapter 31: Putting it on the Tab

### Scene 1: The Detonation

- **Key Event:** The Flux-Mech's reactor goes critical. A miniature sun blooms on the surface of the Lead Sphere.
- **Key Event:** The explosion is silent in the vacuum, but the blinding white light washes out the ship's sensors.

### Scene 2: The Shattering

- **Key Event:** The Lead Sphere cracks. The perfect geometry is flawed. The "Order" is broken by chaotic energy.
- **Key Event:** It doesn't debris; it destabilizes. The Sphere unravels into raw, unshaped Prima-Materia.

### Scene 3: The Silence

- **Key Event:** The light fades. Where the Sphere was, there is now just drifting dust. Zephyr is gone.
- **Key Event:** Midas (the drone) circles the wreckage, letting out a mechanical screech that transmits over the open comms.
