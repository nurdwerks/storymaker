## Chapter 20: The Fatigue

### Scene 1: The Quartermaster / The Resistance Base

- **Key Event:** Zephyr manages the logistics of the resistance.
- **Detailed Description:** The resistance base is a hollowed-out asteroid, spinning in the shadow of a gas giant. Inside, the air is thin and smells of ozone and unwashed bodies. Zephyr sits behind a desk made of crates. He is surrounded by dataslates, ration packs, and weapon parts. He is the Quartermaster, the man who keeps the war machine running on fumes. A line of soldiers waits for supplies. Zephyr denies a request for extra plasma cells. He explains, with tired patience, that they don't have them. He counts bullets like a miser counts gold.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks different. His hair is grey at the temples. The rogue's grin is gone, replaced by a permanent frown of concentration. He wears a datapad on his wrist that tracks every gram of protein and every volt of power in the base.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr hates this job. He used to be a thief, a man of freedom. Now he is a bureaucrat of the apocalypse. But he knows that if he slips, people starve. His greed has been sublimated into a hoarding instinct for the group. He is the dragon guarding the hoard, but the hoard is just bread and bullets.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr (The Gilded Rogue)** — He shows his evolution. He is no longer stealing for himself; he is stealing time for everyone else.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Three bullets per person. No exceptions. Not even for you, princess. You want more? Go find a mine."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm not a princess anymore, Zephyr. And I need a full clip."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Yeah, well. Old habits. Here. Take mine. I'm just sitting behind a desk anyway."

### Scene 2: The Inventory / The Supply Depot

- **Key Event:** Zephyr gives Angelica the bad news.
- **Detailed Description:** They walk through the supply depot. The shelves are bare. The hydroponics bay is failing; the plants are yellow and withered. The water recyclers are whining, clogging with silt. Zephyr pulls up a holographic chart. It is a line going down. Steeply.
- **Detailed Description:** He lays it out. Six months of food at half-rations. Two months of ammunition if they avoid major engagements. The fuel cells for the life support are at 15%. They are dying. Not from enemy fire, but from entropy. The "Fatigue" of the chapter title refers to the metal fatigue of the base, and the exhaustion of the crew.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels the walls closing in. She has been focused on the enemy fleet, on the grand strategy. She forgot the slow, quiet war against starvation. She looks at Zephyr and sees how tired he is. He has been carrying this weight alone to protect her from the details.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Math doesn't lie, Captain. We've got six months before we start eating each other. Or freezing. Or suffocating. Pick your poison."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "Then we finish this in five. We launch the attack."

### Scene 3: The Old Man / The Depot Office

- **Key Event:** Zephyr and Angelica share a quiet moment.
- **Detailed Description:** They sit in the office, drinking synthetic coffee that tastes like rust. Zephyr rubs his knees. The dampness of the asteroid gets to his joints. He talks about the old days, about the Silt. He remembers the taste of real food, the smell of rain. He is nostalgic, which is dangerous.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica realizes he is old. They are all getting old. The war has stolen their youth. She touches his hand. It is rough, scarred. He is the last link to her childhood.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr admits he is tired. He is tired of running numbers. He wants to fly again. He wants to steal something. He wants to feel the rush.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He reveals the cost of loyalty. He stayed for her.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You could have left. Years ago. You could have taken a shuttle and found a colony."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Where would I go? You're the only one who still owes me money. And besides... who would count the beans?"

### Scene 4: The Plan / The War Room

- **Key Event:** The decision to attack.
- **Detailed Description:** Driven by the logistics, Angelica calls a meeting. She presents the plan to retake the Zenith. It is desperate. It relies on speed and surprise because they don't have the endurance for a siege. Zephyr runs the numbers on the tactical display. He calculates fuel burn, ammo expenditure, casualty rates.
- **Detailed Description:** The computer spits out a probability: 12%. Silence in the room. 12% chance of success. 88% chance of total annihilation. **General Ria** stands by the map, her arms crossed. Her armor is battered, stripped of its original sheen, but she looks solid. She nods at Zephyr's numbers, accepting the grim reality of the battlefield.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr looks at the number. In the old days, he would have folded. 12% is a sucker's bet. But he looks at the empty shelves. He looks at Angelica. He realizes that 12% is better than the 0% chance they have if they stay. He nods. He pushes the chips to the center of the table.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "If everything goes perfectly... if the wind blows right, and the stars align... we have a twelve percent chance."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Twelve percent is a luxury. We've fought with less. The question isn't the odds; it's the ammo. Can we sustain fire for the duration of the breach?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Better odds than usual. We take it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "That's what worries me. You're starting to like the long shots. All right. I'll issue the extra rations. Last meal and all that."
