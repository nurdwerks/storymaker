## Chapter 06: The Discovery

### Scene 1: The Vault

- **Key Event:** The Mission.
- **Detailed Description:** **Zephyr** traverses the Lower Decks of the _Aeterna_. He is officially tasked with "Strategic Resource Assessment"—a fancy title **Angelica** gave him to keep him busy. His job is to open doors that have been sealed for centuries and see if there is anything useful inside.
- **Key Event:** The Door.
- **Detailed Description:** He reaches the end of a long, unlit corridor in Sector 9. He finds a door unlike the others. It is not standard bulkhead gray. It is polished titanium alloy, reinforced with cross-bracing. Stenciled on it in faded black letters is: **PAYLOAD 4 - CLASS A SECURE**.
- **Key Event:** The Lock.
- **Detailed Description:** The seal is a biometric lock that died centuries ago when the auxiliary power failed. Zephyr taps it with his pry-bar. It is solid. He grins.
- **Key Event:** The Breach.
- **Detailed Description:** He unslings his portable plasma-cutter. He adjusts the beam aperture to "fine." He traces the outline of the hinges. Sparks fly, showering the dark corridor in orange light. The smell of ozone and melting metal fills the air. He works with the precision of a master surgeon—or a master thief. Which, effectively, he is.
- **Key Event:** The Entry.
- **Detailed Description:** The last hinge gives way with a screech. The door sags. Zephyr plants his boot in the center and kicks. It falls inward with a deafening clang that echoes in the emptiness. He steps inside, his flashlight beam cutting the dust.

### Scene 2: The Motherlode

- **Key Event:** The Contents.
- **Detailed Description:** The room is a cube, ten meters by ten meters. It is stacked floor-to-ceiling with reinforced polymer crates. They are strapped down with magnetic clamps.
- **Key Event:** The Open.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr approaches the nearest stack. He pops the latches on a crate. They hiss as the vacuum seal breaks. He lifts the lid.
- **Key Event:** The Reflection.
- **Detailed Description:** The light from his torch hits the contents and bounces back, blinding him for a second. Gold. Bars of it. Standard Inter-System Bullion. Stamped with the logos of nations that haven't existed for five hundred years.
- **Key Event:** The Inventory.
- **Detailed Description:** He opens another crate. Diamonds. Uncut industrial diamonds the size of his fist. Another crate. Platinum ingots. Another. Rare earth metals refined to 99.9% purity.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** He does the math in his head. At current exchange rates (or rather, the rates back in the Zenith before the fall), he is looking at trillions of credits. He is standing in the middle of the ship's financial payload, intended to jumpstart the economy of the new world. He is standing in more wealth than the entire Undercity generated in a generation.
- **Key Event:** The Weight.
- **Detailed Description:** He picks up a gold bar. It is heavy, dense, and cold. It feels smooth against his glove.
- **Key Event:** The Instinct.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr feels the familiar rush of greed. The dopamine hit. This is the "Big Score" he dreamed of his entire life. The one job that lets you retire to a private moon with an ocean of wine. He could buy an army. He could buy a planet.

### Scene 3: The Joke

- **Key Event:** The Reality.
- **Detailed Description:** But then the reality of their situation hits him like a physical blow. He looks around the dusty, cold room.
- **Key Event:** The Context.
- **Detailed Description:** They are drifting in deep space. They are being hunted by an alien fleet. There is no port to dock at. There are no shops. There are no banks. There is no economy.
- **Key Event:** The Uselessness.
- **Detailed Description:** The gold is just... heavy yellow metal. It is soft. You can't make tools out of it. You can't eat it. You can't burn it for fuel. In the context of survival, it is less valuable than a bag of fertilizer.
- **Key Event:** The Laughter.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr starts to chuckle. The chuckle builds. It turns into a laugh. Then a roar. He sits down on a stack of gold bars, laughing until tears stream down his face, wiping them away with a dirty glove.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He realizes the supreme absurdity of his ambition. He spent his life chasing this specific metal, assigning it ultimate value. And now that he has more of it than any king in history, it is utterly useless. The universe has played the ultimate prank on him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I did it. I won the game. I'm the richest man in the graveyard. And I'd trade it all for a sandwich. A real sandwich. With mustard. And maybe a pickle."

### Scene 4: The Choice

- **Key Event:** The Decision.
- **Detailed Description:** He stands up, brushing the dust off his trousers. He looks at the crates. He thinks about telling the others.
- **Key Event:** The Logic.
- **Detailed Description:** He realizes it would only cause problems. Morale is fragile. People are irrational. They would fight over this, even if it's useless. They would hoard it. It would become a distraction. A virus.
- **Key Event:** The Memento.
- **Detailed Description:** He reaches into the open crate. He takes a single gold bar. He weighs it in his hand. He slides it into his thigh pocket. Not as currency, but as a reminder. A memento of who he used to be. A reminder of the "Gilded Rogue."
- **Key Event:** The Seal.
- **Detailed Description:** He closes the crate. He walks out of the room.
- **Key Event:** The Lie.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns and uses his plasma cutter to weld the door shut. He fuses the metal so thoroughly it will never open again. Then, he pulls out a marker and scrawls on the door: **RADIATION DANGER. CONTAMINATED. DO NOT ENTER.**
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He lies to protect the crew from their own greed, choosing to bury the treasure rather than let it corrupt the fragile society they are building. He proves he is a protector, not just a thief.

### Scene 5: The Call

- **Key Event:** The Comms.
- **Detailed Description:** He activates his headset. The link crackles.
- **Key Event:** The Request.
- **Detailed Description:** **Lisbet** is on the line. She is in Engineering, sounding tired and stressed.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Zephyr? Did you find anything useful down there? We're dying for copper wire. Or insulation. Please tell me you found insulation. The water recyclers are leaking again."
- **Key Event:** The Answer.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr pats the gold bar in his pocket.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Just... ballast, Lis. Heavy metal. Junk. Nothing we can eat. Nothing we can burn. Total bust."
- **Key Event:** The Request.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet sighs.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "Ugh. Useless. Bring me back something useful. Like a screwdriver. I lost my phillips-head in the intake vent."
- **Key Event:** The Value.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr smiles.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Yeah. A screwdriver. I'll look. I think that's worth more than gold right now. I'll check the maintenance bays."
- **Key Event:** The Exit.
- **Detailed Description:** He walks away down the dark corridor, whistling a tune, leaving the fortune behind in the dark.
