## Chapter 14: The Years

### Scene 1: The Montage

- **Key Event:** The Passage of Time.
- **Detailed Description:** Time ceases to be measured in hours or days. It is measured in rivets. In welds. In layers of hull plating. The jungle does not mark time with calendars; it marks it with growth and decay.
- **Key Event:** **Year 1.**
- **Detailed Description:** The keel is laid. It is a massive spine of smelted iron, black and ugly against the green moss. The village is still a collection of mud huts. The work is slow, clumsy.
- **Key Event:** **Year 3.**
- **Detailed Description:** The ribs rise up. They loop into the sky like the bleached skeleton of a whale. Scaffolding made of bamboo covers the structure.
- **Key Event:** **Year 5.**
- **Detailed Description:** The first hull plates are hammered into place. The sound is a constant, rhythmic clanging that echoes through the valley from dawn to dusk. It becomes the heartbeat of the tribe. The village has grown into a town of wooden structures.
- **Key Event:** **Year 10.**
- **Detailed Description:** The engines are mounted. Massive, distinct shapes that promise fire. They are hoisted by a complex system of pulleys and counterweights designed by Angelica.
- **Key Event:** The Constant.
- **Detailed Description:** Through it all, Angelica is there. Pointing. Yelling. Drawing in the dirt. She is a blur of motion. She sleeps in short bursts, naps taken on piles of lumber. She eats while walking. She is possessed. Whenever the fatigue threatens to crush her, she whispers Ria's old mantra.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ _The watch doesn't end when you're tired, Commander. It ends when the relief arrives. Twenty years? That's just a long shift._
- **Key Event:** The Cycle.
- **Detailed Description:** The seasons change. The jungle grows back, and they cut it down. The rains come, turning the site into a quagmire, and they work in the mud. The sun burns, baking the clay, and they work in the heat.
- **Key Event:** The Passing.
- **Detailed Description:** **Elder Corinne** does not see the ship finished. In the seventh winter, she passes peacefully in her sleep, wrapped in the finest furs the tribe could hunt. Her funeral pyre is the first fire lit in the ship's massive forge—a symbolic transfer of warmth from the old world to the new engine. Ragnar and Angelica stand together as the smoke rises, acknowledging the end of an era.

### Scene 2: The Broken Brother

- **Key Event:** **Year 12.**
- **Detailed Description:** A tragedy strikes the logging camp upriver.
- **Key Event:** The Accident.
- **Detailed Description:** A massive redwood, destined for the interior bracing, shifts on the rollers. The mud is slick from the rains.
- **Key Event:** The Victim.
- **Detailed Description:** Bjorn the Breaker, Ragnar's blood-brother and strongest lieutenant, is too slow. He slips. The log rolls over his legs.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** The crunch of bone is sickening. Bjorn screams. It is a high, thin sound that cuts through the forest.
- **Key Event:** The Rescue.
- **Detailed Description:** The healers and workers rush in. They use levers to pry the log off. They drag him out. His legs are ruined—crushed beyond repair.
- **Key Event:** The Scene.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar stands over him. Bjorn is pale, shock setting in.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Bjorn:** "Brother... help me up. I can't feel my feet."
- **Key Event:** The decision.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar looks at the mangled limbs. Then he looks at the log. It has stopped moving, but it is blocking the path.
- **Key Event:** The Order.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar turns to the men.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Move the log."
- **Key Event:** The Protest.
- **Detailed Description:** One of the workers hesitates.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Worker:** "But Bjorn... he needs help."
- **Key Event:** The Ruthlessness.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar roars.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Move the log! The ship needs wood! The schedule does not wait for broken bones!"
- **Key Event:** The Metaphor.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks down at Bjorn. There is no pity in his eyes. Only cold calculation.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "A wolf that cannot run drags down the pack. You are done, Bjorn. You are weight now."
- **Key Event:** The Abandonment.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns his back and walks away to supervise the lifting. Bjorn is left in the mud, staring at his brother's back, realizing that in this new world, utility is the only currency.

### Scene 3: The Aging

- **Key Event:** **Year 18.**
- **Detailed Description:** The hull is complete. The ship is a dark monolith against the stars.
- **Key Event:** The Setting.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica sits on the edge of the finished upper deck, legs dangling 100 feet in the air. The wind is cooler up here.
- **Key Event:** The Mirror.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at her hands. They are calloused, scarred, the nails chipped. They are the hands of a worker, not a noble. She touches her face. She feels the lines around her eyes, etched by squinting at blueprints and the sun.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** There is gray in her hair. She was twenty when she crashed. She is almost forty now. Her youth has evaporated in the humidity.
- **Key Event:** The Companion.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin sits beside her. He is grayer too. Thicker around the waist, but solid as an oak. He moves slower, his joints stiff from the damp.
- **Key Event:** The Offering.
- **Detailed Description:** He passes her a water skin. She drinks.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "It is a good view. You can see the ocean from here."
- **Key Event:** The Lament.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica sighs.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm old, Torin. Look at me. I'm a hag. My skin is leather. My back hurts every morning."
- **Key Event:** The Reassurance.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin looks at her. He studies her face like a map.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "No. You look like the mountain. Strong. Weathered. Unmovable."
- **Key Event:** The Touch.
- **Detailed Description:** He reaches out and traces a scar on her cheek with his thumb.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "The smooth stone is pretty, Angel. But the rough stone holds the wall. You are the rough stone. You hold us all up."
- **Key Event:** The Intimacy.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica leans into his touch. It is the only softness she allows herself. The only moment she is not the Commander.

### Scene 4: The Truth

- **Key Event:** The Sunset.
- **Detailed Description:** The sun sets, turning the hull to gold. The jungle below is a sea of darkness.
- **Key Event:** The Confession.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stares at the horizon.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering) "I missed it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Missed what?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "My life. I missed being young. I missed dancing. I missed... everything. I feel like I blinked, and twenty years disappeared into this... this machine."
- **Key Event:** The Regret.
- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the ship. Her masterpiece. Her prison.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Time moves differently when you are building something eternal. I forgot to count the years, Torin. I woke up, and my youth was gone. I traded my life for a ship."
- **Key Event:** The Perspective.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin stands up. He offers her a hand.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "You traded your life for _our_ lives. For the future. That is a fair trade."
- **Key Event:** The Acceptance.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica takes his hand. She pulls herself up, grimacing at the stiffness in her knees.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let's hope so. Because I can't get a refund."
- **Key Event:** The Return.
- **Detailed Description:** They walk back toward the hatch, two aging figures silhouetted against the dying light, walking into the belly of the beast they built together.
