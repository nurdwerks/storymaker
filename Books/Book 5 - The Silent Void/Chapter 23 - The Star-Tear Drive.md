### Scene 1: Engineering Core

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Vane access the Star-Tear Drive's schematics, realizing it's a device that literally tears reality to fold space, a technology that is both miraculous and terrifyingly unstable.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Confronts the terrifying legacy of her ancestors, who designed themselves to be "hardware" for the ship.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They didn't build a ship. They built a cage for their children."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "No, my dear. They built a chariot."

- **Key Event:** Lisbet warns that without a super-computer to calculate the jump vector, the drive is a suicide machine; Vane points to the Interface Throne.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Terrified by the lack of safety protocols, she realizes that Angelica is the only one who can navigate the "scream of the universe."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "The margin for error is zero. Less than zero. We'll jump into a star or the void."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Not if we have a pilot who can see the path."
