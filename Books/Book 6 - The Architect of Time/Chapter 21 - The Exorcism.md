## Chapter 21: The Exorcism

### Scene 1: The Trap / Reactor Core

- **Key Event:** The reactor core of the _Aeterna_. It hums with a dangerous, unstable rhythm.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands on the catwalk. She is sweating.
- **Key Event:** She is building something. A "ghost trap."
- **Key Event:** It looks like a pile of junk. A disassembled Tesla coil from the med-bay. Copper wire from a comms relay. And in the center, a massive, raw quartz crystal she mined from the cave.
- **Key Event:** "This is insane," Torin says from the doorway. He is holding a heavy lead box.
- **Key Event:** "It's physics," Angelica corrects. "Ghosts—or energy projections, or whatever Vane has become—are just ionic patterns. Organized static."
- **Key Event:** She tightens a wire.
- **Key Event:** "Static seeks a ground," she explains. "I'm giving him the ultimate ground. A perfect, conductive lattice."
- **Key Event:** She points to the crystal.
- **Key Event:** "And you?" Torin asks.
- **Key Event:** "I'm the bait," she says. "He wants a vessel. I'm going to offer him one."

### Scene 2: The Lure / Reactor Room

- **Key Event:** Torin retreats to the shielded control room. The blast doors seal.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is alone.
- **Key Event:** She closes her eyes. She lowers her mental shields.
- **Key Event:** She thinks about Vane. She projects her fear, her anger. She makes herself "loud" in the psychic spectrum.
- **Key Event:** _Come and get me, you old vulture._
- **Key Event:** The temperature drops. Frost forms on the railing.
- **Key Event:** The lights flicker and die. The only illumination is the blue glow of the reactor.
- **Key Event:** A sound begins. A whisper. A thousand voices overlapping.
- **Key Event:** A shape forms in the air. A storm of static and malice.
- **Key Event:** It has no face, but she feels his eyes.
- **Key Event:** **"Angelica,"** the voice vibrates in her teeth.
- **Key Event:** **"I will wear your skin like a suit,"** Vane hisses. **"I will use your body to pilot the ship. And when we arrive, I will burn the Zenith to the ground."**
- **Key Event:** He lunges. A bolt of pure electricity arcs toward her chest.

### Scene 3: The Capture / Reactor Room

- **Key Event:** Angelica doesn't flinch. She waits until he is inches away.
- **Key Event:** Until she can smell the ozone of his presence.
- **Key Event:** "Now!" she screams.
- **Key Event:** She slams her hand onto the activator switch.
- **Key Event:** _CRACK-BOOM._
- **Key Event:** The Tesla coil shrieks to life.
- **Key Event:** A cage of lightning surrounds her.
- **Key Event:** Vane hits the field and screams. It is not a human scream. It is the sound of tearing metal.
- **Key Event:** The electricity grabs him. It pulls him away from Angelica.
- **Key Event:** It channels him down the copper wires. Into the crystal.
- **Key Event:** The crystal glows. Bright white. Then blinding blue. Then a deep, angry violet.
- **Key Event:** The room shakes. The crystal vibrates on the pedestal, threatening to shatter.
- **Key Event:** "Hold it together," Angelica pleads.
- **Key Event:** Vane struggles. The face pushes against the inside of the crystal.
- **Key Event:** Then, with a final _pop_, the resistance breaks. He is sucked inside.
- **Key Event:** Silence.
- **Key Event:** Angelica collapses, gasping.
- **Key Event:** "Gotcha," she whispers.

### Scene 4: The Battery / Reactor Room

- **Key Event:** The crystal is hot. It pulses like a heart.
- **Key Event:** Torin rushes in. He is wearing heavy gloves.
- **Key Event:** He grabs the crystal with tongs and drops it into the lead box.
- **Key Event:** He slams the lid and locks it.
- **Key Event:** "Is he...?"
- **Key Event:** "He's in there," Angelica says. She stands up, shaky.
- **Key Event:** She walks over to the box. She taps the lid.
- **Key Event:** "Can he get out?"
- **Key Event:** "No. Not without a conductor. He's a battery now."
- **Key Event:** She smiles. It is a terrifying smile.
- **Key Event:** "We needed more power to reach warp velocity," she says. "We just found it."
- **Key Event:** She speaks to the box.
- **Key Event:** "Congratulations, Prelate. You just became the backup generator. You're going to help us fly, whether you like it or not."
- **Key Event:** She turns to Torin.
- **Key Event:** "Plug him in."
