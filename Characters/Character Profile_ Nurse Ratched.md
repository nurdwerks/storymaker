# Character Profile: Nurse Ratched (The Handler)

**Archetype:** The Clinical Handler / The Gatekeeper
**True Sin:** GREED (Hunger for professional control and bureaucratic authority over the lives of the "feeble").
**Virtue Mask:** PROFESSIONALISM (She frames her scolding and exclusion as "Patient Care").

## I. Role in the Story

Nurse Ratched is a severe nurse who administers Joyce’s "medication" (which is actually combat stimulants). She is the "bridge" between the home and the assassin's world.

- **The Deference:** She treats Joyce with professional respect while looking at Angelica with bureaucratic disdain.
- **The Authority:** She frequently scolds Angelica for "upsetting the residents" and chases her out of the room, using the rules of the retirement home to keep the assassin's secrets safe.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Medical Blackmail. The Zenith discovers Ratched’s role in supplying combat stimulants to an assassin. They don't arrest her; they blackmail her into "poisoning" Joyce with a slow-acting sedative to neutralize her without a fight.
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce begins to lose her edge, feeling sluggish and confused. She doesn't realize the betrayal until it's almost too late, shattering her trust in the "handler" who was supposed to be her primary support in the field.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Bridge" becomes a trap. The connection between the home and the assassin's world is compromised, leading to a state of extreme paranoia where Joyce no longer knows who is a friend and who is an operative.

## III. Book 4 Integration

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 22
- **Scene:** "The Betrayal" (Medical Blackmail)
- **Role:** The Handler Turned Traitor
- **Quote:** "Patient care sometimes requires euthanasia."
