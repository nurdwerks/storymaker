## Chapter 06: The Auction of Souls

### Scene 1: The Descent into the Pit

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward and Lady Corinne travel from the Zenith down to the Auction Hall on Level 30.
- **Detailed Description:** The Auction Hall is a massive, circular arena carved into the ship's superstructure. It was originally a cargo bay, but now it serves as the marketplace for human labor. The air is thick with the smell of unwashed bodies and expensive cologne—the scent of the rich buying the poor. The lighting is harsh and theatrical, spotlighting the central stage while leaving the tiers of seats in shadow. Above the stage, a hologram of **The Emperor** delivers a pre-recorded address about "The Sacred Duty of Labor" and "The Honor of Service"—propaganda designed to legitimize the sale of human beings. Angelica wears her grey dress like armor. Corinne holds a scented handkerchief to her nose.
- **Key Event:** Angelica comments on the nature of the auction.
- **Detailed Description:** As they walk down the aisle, Angelica notes the faces of the bidders. They are bored. Buying people is a mundane chore to them, like grocery shopping. Above, the Emperor's hologram speaks of "Shared Sacrifice"—a phrase that makes Angelica's teeth grind.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "It's necessary, Angie. The ship needs labor. Contracts are the only way to manage the population."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's not management, Corinne. It's salvage. You're stripping them for parts. Slavery just makes the collapse profitable."

### Scene 2: The Merchandise

- **Key Event:** Angelica slips away from Corinne and enters the restricted staging area behind the stage.
- **Detailed Description:** The staging area is a cage. Hundreds of people from the Undercity—debtors, criminals, and "surplus population"—are crammed into holding pens. They are stripped to their undergarments, marked with barcodes on their foreheads. Guards with shock-batons patrol the perimeter.
- **Key Event:** Angelica finds Miller among the prisoners.
- **Detailed Description:** Miller is sitting on a bench, nursing his cybernetic arm. The servos are grinding; it needs oil. He looks tired, defeated. He recognizes Angelica. He tries to hide his face, ashamed to be seen in chains.
- **Key Event:** Angelica confronts him.
- **Detailed Description:** She kneels by the bars. She grabs his metal hand. She realizes that Vane is selling off the veterans of the old wars to break their spirit.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She feels a surge of protective rage. These are her people. She makes a silent vow to free them, not just Miller, but all of them.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Miller:** "Go away, kid. Don't look at me like this. I'm just scrap metal now."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "You're not scrap. You're the engine. And I'm getting you out."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Miller:** "Don't waste your credits on a broken old gear like me. Buy the young ones. They have a chance."

### Scene 3: The Bidding War

- **Key Event:** Angelica returns to the auction floor just as Lot 49—"The Mechanic's Guild Remnants"—is brought on stage.
- **Detailed Description:** The Auctioneer, a man with a gold-plated microphone implanted in his throat, describes the lot. "Twenty skilled laborers. Grade B condition. Ideal for heavy industry or reactor maintenance." The bidding starts low. The Highborn don't want old mechanics; they want house servants. In the upper gallery, **Matriarch Lilith Night** observes the proceedings with cold detachment, her silver mask catching the stage lights. She is here not to bid, but to monitor House Night's investments and enemies.
- **Key Event:** Duke Grey enters the bidding, intending to buy them for his mines.
- **Detailed Description:** Grey raises his paddle lazily. He plans to send them to the helium extraction zones—a death sentence. He spots Angelica. He smiles. He bids just to annoy her. Near the back of the hall, **Baron Gilded** watches the exchange with calculating interest, his golden monocle gleaming as he makes notes on a datapad.
- **Key Event:** Angelica engages in a bidding war.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica raises her paddle. The price climbs. 10,000 credits. 20,000. 50,000. The crowd murmurs. This is an exorbitant sum for "Grade B" labor. Angelica is spending the stipend Vane gave her to buy dresses. She is spending her future.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica knows she is bankrupting herself. She will have no money for bribes, for equipment, for food. But she cannot let Miller die in the dark.
- **Key Event:** Grey drops out.
- **Detailed Description:** Grey laughs. He lets the paddle fall. He decides that bankrupting Angelica is more fun than owning the mechanics.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Duke Valerius Grey:** "Too rich for my blood. Let the girl have her pets. She needs someone to fix her hair. Sold to the Lady in Grey!"

- **Key Event:** Security presence.
- **Detailed Description:** Standing at the perimeter of the auction floor, **Joyce (The Needle)** maintains her post as part of the Zenith's security detail. Her eyes sweep the crowd with professional efficiency, cataloging threats. She notes Angelica's unusual bidding behavior and Baron Gilded's intense observation, filing both details away for later analysis.

- **Character Defining Moment:** **Matriarch Lilith Night** — She watches the Ward girl's reckless expenditure with quiet intrigue. The child is either foolish or visionary. Either way, she represents a variable that House Night must monitor closely.

### Scene 4: The Aftermath

- **Key Event:** Angelica signs the contract, transferring ownership of the twenty mechanics to her name.
- **Detailed Description:** The digital ink seals the deal. Angelica's account hits zero. Corinne is furious. She drags Angelica into a side corridor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "Are you insane? You spent everything! Vane gave you that money to build a court presence, not a charity ward! What are you going to do with twenty greasy mechanics in a penthouse?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica redefines the relationship.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the readout on her datapad. "Asset: Miller." "Asset: Korg." "Asset: Mara." She deletes the word "Asset" and types "Crew."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She commits to structural change. She isn't playing the game of social climbing; she is building an army.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I didn't buy servants, Corinne. I bought a crew. And I have a lot of things that need fixing. Starting with this ship."

### Scene 5: The Backroom Deal

- **Key Event:** In the shadow of the Auction Hall, Zephyr attempts to fence stolen encryption keys.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr meets with "Sly," a fence who operates out of a noodle stand near the loading docks. Zephyr is nervous. He looks over his shoulder. The keys he stole from the Museum are hot. He needs credits to buy his way off the ship (or so he thinks).
- **Key Event:** Sly rejects the deal.
- **Detailed Description:** Sly pushes the data-chip back. He looks terrified. He tells Zephyr that Vane has put a "Black Bounty" on anyone connected to the Museum heist. Not a capture bounty—a kill order.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Sly:** "I can't be seen with you. The Market is closed, Zephyr. For good. Anyone who talks to you is dead. Vane isn't arresting people anymore; he's erasing them."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr realizes he is trapped.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr stands alone in the steam of the noodle shop. He has a pocket full of treasure and no way to spend it. He realizes his only option is to find Angelica—the only other person crazy enough to fight Vane.

4. **Internal Conflict:** Add this section where characters are facing difficult choices or emotional turmoil.
5. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
6. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
