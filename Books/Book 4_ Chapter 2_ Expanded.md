### Chapter 2: The New Rules

#### Scene 1: The Scavenge

They hit the ground hard. The gravity dampeners flickered one last time just before impact, turning a lethal fall into a bone-jarring crash. Angelica rolled, absorbing the momentum, and slammed into a pile of refuse. She lay there for a moment, gasping, the wind knocked out of her. The air here was thick, smelling of burning plastic, rot, and the metallic tang of blood.

Sector 4. The Slums. Ground Zero.

She pushed herself up. They had landed in what used to be a market square. Now it was a crater. Debris from the Zenith lay everywhere—shattered marble columns, twisted gold plating, and the bodies of those who hadn't been lucky enough to have dampeners. The silence of the void was replaced by the moans of the dying and the crackle of fires.

"Zephyr?" she called out, coughing.

"Here," came a groan from a pile of trash bags. Zephyr pulled himself out, clutching his dead arm. "I think I broke a rib. Add it to the tab."

Angelica scanned the area. It was chaos. Survivors were crawling out of the woodwork—Undercity locals, dirty and desperate, picking through the wreckage. But there were others too. Zenith nobles who had fallen with the Spire. They wandered the ruins in their torn silks, dazed and bleeding, looking like ghosts in a graveyard.

A few yards away, a man was crawling across the broken pavement. He wore the tattered remains of a velvet doublet, the crest of House Vermillion embroidered on the chest. His leg was twisted at a sickening angle.

"Help me!" he screamed at a passing figure. "I am Lord Vermillion! I command you!"

The figure stopped. It was a local scavenger, a man wrapped in rags, his face hidden by a rebreather mask. He looked down at the noble, then at the noble's boots—fine, high-quality leather.

The scavenger didn't offer a hand. He knelt and began to unlace the boots.

"What are you doing? Get off me!" Vermillion shrieked, kicking feebly.

#### Scene 2: The Kill

The scavenger drew a rusty shiv. "Stop kicking," he growled, his voice muffled by the mask. "Or I take the feet too."

"Do you know who I am?" Vermillion spat, trying to summon the authority of a world that no longer existed. "I am a Peer of the Realm! I will have you—"

*Crack.*

The sound was wet and final.

Angelica flinched. But it wasn't the scavenger who had struck.

Ria stepped out of the shadows like a nightmare made of iron. She was covered in grey dust, her heavy mining boots crunching on the glass. She had grabbed the scavenger by the back of the neck and snapped his spine with one efficient twist of her wrist. She dropped him like a sack of wet cement.

Vermillion let out a sob of relief. "Thank the Founders! You... you're one of the soldiers, aren't you? Help me up. I'll reward you. I have credits—"

Ria didn't look at him. She bent down and finished unlacing the boots the scavenger had started to take. She pulled them off the noble's feet, ignoring his cry of pain as his broken leg shifted.

"My boots!" Vermillion gasped. "You can't—"

Ria stood up, holding the boots. She inspected the soles. "Good grip. insulated."

She turned and tossed them to a small figure crouching behind a dumpster. Lisbet caught them, clutching them to her chest. The hacker looked tiny, her eyes wide behind her oversized goggles, her rubber coat torn.

"Put them on," Ria commanded. "Your soles were worn through."

#### Scene 3: The Speech

Angelica scrambled over the rubble, Zephyr limping behind her. "Ria!"

Ria turned, her face a mask of indifference. Her skin, the color of bruised clay, was already beginning to show the dull grey sheen of her metal bond merging.

"You're alive," Ria said flatly. "Good. We need bodies."

"You killed him," Angelica said, gesturing to the scavenger. "He was just hungry."

"He was weak," Ria said, her voice grinding like gears. "He hesitated. He was negotiating for boots he should have just taken. The noble is dead weight. The scavenger was a vulture. I am neither."

She looked at Angelica, her yellow eyes hard. "And neither are you, Princess. Not anymore."

Angelica looked at Lord Vermillion. He was weeping, clutching his bare feet, shivering in the cold mud.

"We have to help him," Angelica said, reaching for her med-kit.

Ria grabbed her wrist. Her grip was like a vice. "No."

"He's hurt, Ria."

"He's noise," Ria spat. "He's calorie-negative. We can't carry him. We can't feed him. If you heal him, he just starves slower. Leave him."

#### Scene 4: The Law

A crowd was gathering. Survivors from the crash, locals from the slums. They watched the confrontation, eyes hollow, waiting to see who was in charge.

Ria climbed onto a slab of fallen concrete. She loomed over them, a titan of scrap metal and muscle. She pointed a massive, rusted finger at the dead scavenger, then at the weeping noble.

"Look at them!" she roared, her voice echoing off the ruined buildings. "This is the new world! The Spire is gone! The Emperor is gone! The laws that protected you? They fell with the roof!"

She paced the slab, her boots clanking.

"Zenith laws are for full bellies," she declared. "Down here, the only law is caloric intake. You work, you eat. You steal, you die. You whine, you get left behind."

She looked directly at Angelica. "There are no seats on the council here, Vance. There is only the food chain. Are you eating, or are you meat?"

Angelica looked at the dead scavenger, then at the noble who was slowly freezing to death. She felt a cold knot in her stomach. Ria was right. The logic of the Zenith—diplomacy, charity, hierarchy—was useless here. It was a currency that had no value.

She pulled her wrist free from Ria's grip. She didn't go to help the noble. She stepped back, her face hardening.

"We need shelter," Angelica said, her voice void of emotion. "Grab the supplies."

Ria smiled, a sharp, ugly expression. "Now you're learning."

Angelica looked at Zephyr. He was staring at the dead noble, clutching his own expensive coat.

"Morality is a luxury we left upstairs," Angelica whispered to him. "Move."

As they walked away, the sound of the noble's weeping faded, swallowed by the wind. Angelica didn't look back.
