# Character Profile: Captain Thorne

**Archetype:** The Warden of Duty / The Father Figure
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views Kaelen's potential and noble lineage as his own personal achievement).
**Virtue Mask:** VIGILANCE (He frames his emotional interference as "Perimeter Checks").

## I. Role in the Story

Captain Thorne is the commander of Kaelen’s personal guard and the man who trained him. He represents the weight of the "Night" family legacy that chains Kaelen to his past.

- **The Obstacle:** He treats Kaelen with fatherly pride but views Angelica as a "security risk" to both Kaelen's life and his status as a noble.
- **The Wedge:** He frequently interrupts their conversations with "perimeter checks" or "urgent reports," using his authority to drive a wedge between the two and remind Kaelen of his "true" duty.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Honorable Sacrifice / Death. During the escape from the Crystal Hall, Captain Thorne stays behind to hold the palace corridor alone, allowing Kaelen and Angelica to escape. He dies as he lived: in absolute service to the family.
- **Impact on Kaelen Night:** Kaelen is crushed. He loses the only father figure he ever knew. His grief turns into a rigid, almost robotic adherence to the Captain's training, making him emotionally colder and more distant from Angelica as he tries to honor Thorne's memory.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Night Guard" loses its commander. The remaining guardsmen look to Kaelen for leadership, but his grief-driven distance leaves them feeling adrift and vulnerable, shattering the sense of safety Thorne provided.

**Event Location:** Book 3, Chapter 24
**Defining Quote:** _"Perimeter check complete, sir. The corridor holds."_
