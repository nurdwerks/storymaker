# Character Profile: Pixel

**Archetype:** The Digital Youth / The Runner
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for the "cool" of the underground and for Lisbet's approval).
**Virtue Mask:** INNOCENCE (She claims her insults are just telling the truth).

## I. Role in the Story

Pixel is a young girl who works as a "runner" for data chips in the Underground. She worships Lisbet and represents the community that Angelica can never join.

- **The Scorn:** She sticks her tongue out at Angelica and calls her "The Glitchless," identifying her as someone who doesn't belong in the "real" (digital) world.
- **The Devotion:** She brings Lisbet candy and drawings, showing a simple, uncomplicated love that highlight's Angelica's own complex and lonely existence.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Forced Reality / Maiming. **Location:** Book 2, Chapter 8 (The Runner). Pixel’s cybernetic "eye" (her primary artistic tool) is forcibly removed by a Silt-gang who wants her digital art credits. She is left "blind" to the digital world she spent her life in.
  **Quote:** _"It's just hardware."_
- **Impact on Lisbet:** Lisbet offers to replace the eye with a standard Zenith surveillance model, but Pixel refuses, realizing that she has become a "vessel" for the very system she fought. Pixel’s cynicism turns into a quiet, suicidal despair.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Laughter" stops. The Underground loses its artistic voice, turning from a vibrant community of rebels into a cold, transactional network of hackers who no longer care about the "message."

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Key Event | Pixel, one of Lisbet's young runners, arrives at the safehouse door, critically injured. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | The heavy iron door of "The Rusty Gear" shudders with a frantic, weak pounding. Hatcher opens the slat, checking for Wardens, then quickly unbolts the door. Pixel stumbles in, collapsing onto the grimy floor. She is a street kid, maybe twelve years old, wearing oversized mechanics' coveralls. Her face is a mess of blood. The socket where her cheap, scavenged cybernetic eye used to be is now a raw, empty hole, weeping fluid. She clutches a small, blood-slicked data-spike in her trembling hand. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | *Internal Conflict | Lisbet freezes. The "Glitch" persona drops. She rushes to Pixel, her hands hovering over the injury, afraid to touch it. Pixel was under her protection. The violence inflicted on the child cuts through Lisbet's cynicism. Rage, cold and sharp, begins to replace her fear. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Moment | **Lisbet** — She is deeply shaken and vengeful after Pixel’s injury, showing a protective, human side beneath her glitchy exterior. She stops speaking in slang and code, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Pixel:** "They took my eye, Liz. But I kept the data. I swallowed it." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Dialog | **Lisbet:** "Who did this? Give me a name, Pixel. I will crash their pacemaker." |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Key Event | Pixel delivers the decryption key. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 08 | Detailed Description | Pixel coughs, spitting out the small, bio-safe capsule containing the key. Hatcher catches it. He carries the girl to a cot, shouting for clean water and bandages. The mood in the safehouse shifts from cautious planning to grim determination. The enemy has hurt a child. Now it is personal. |
| Book 2 | Chapter 26 | Key Event | **Internal POV (Lisbet):** She is terrified. She remembers the last time she overloaded—the smell of burning hair, the taste of copper. But she remembers pixel, too. She remembers the silence of the people who don't know the truth. |
