## Chapter 2: The Interception

### Scene 1: The Symphony of Code

- **Key Event:** The infiltration.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica hangs suspended upside down from the maintenance catwalk, sixty feet above the pristine, antiseptic white floor of Sector 1's Medical Hub. The air here smells different—sterile, sharp, and expensive. It lacks the copper-and-rot tang of the Silt. She is secured by a climbing harness made from braided optical cable, a piece of scavenged tech she trusts with her life. Her target is the ventilation grate of Storage Locker 4-Alpha.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Angelica calms her breathing. Infiltration is 90% patience and 10% terror. She visualizes the security grid not as a wall, but as a song. The sensors hum in B-flat; the pressure plates click in a rhythmic staccato. She just needs to play the counter-melody.

- **Key Event:** The hack.
- **Detailed Description:** She connects her homemade Haptic Glove to the biometric keypad. The glove is a monstrosity of exposed wiring, duct tape, and stolen processors, but it works. She flexes her fingers, and code streams across her retinal display. The security grid fights back—a standard Zenith "Watchdog" protocol—but Angelica dances around it. She doesn't break the door down; she convinces the door that it wants to open.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Experiences code as music. To her, hacking isn't math; it's jazz. She slides between the security measures like a violin finding silence in the noise, exploiting the gaps between the beats.

- **Key Event:** The acquisition.
- **Detailed Description:** The lock clicks. Green light floods the dark shaft. Angelica eases the grate open and slips inside. The room is lined with shelves of cold-storage canisters. She scans the labels with her ocular implant. _Crate 819: Pediatric Steroid Inhalers. Class A._ Jackpot. She overrides the mag-lock on the crate. It hisses open, revealing rows of silver inhalers. This isn't just medicine; it's life for Leo. It's time.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Pride flares in her chest. She mocks the Zenith's inadequate security. They rely on expensive hardware, but they lack imagination.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Your firewall is a joke. I could write a better security protocol in crayon on a napkin. You people are so arrogant you don't even lock your windows."

### Scene 2: The Knock

- **Key Event:** The shift.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica grabs a handful of inhalers and stuffs them into her satchel. She reaches for the crate of cellular scrubbers next. Suddenly, the ambient hum of the ventilation fans cuts out. The air pressure in the room drops, popping her ears. The silence is sudden and absolute. It isn't a malfunction; it's an override.

- **Key Event:** The intruder.
- **Detailed Description:** A polite, metallic tapping sound echoes from the railing above her. _Tap. Tap. Tap._ It is the sound of a patience that has run out. Angelica freezes. She slowly looks up.

- **Key Event:** The Prelate.
- **Detailed Description:** Standing on the catwalk, right where she lowered herself from, is a figure. He is tall, gaunt, and draped in the pristine, flowing white robes of the High Ministry. His face is a mask of terrifying serenity, but his eyes—his eyes are replaced by Multi-Spectral Oculars, glowing with a soft, predatory blue light. It is Prelate Vane. He isn't accompanied by guards. He is alone.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Demonstrates terrifying competence. He didn't trip an alarm. He didn't send a squad. He simply followed her processing signature back to the source. He identified the flaw in her hack faster than she wrote it.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "You missed a semi-colon on line 400. Sloppy syntax for a virtuoso."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Who are you?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "The B-Flat bypass was clever... but you forgot that the Medical Grid creates a thermal echo when it reroutes power. You silenced the alarm, Miss Ward, but you heated up the wires. I felt the temperature change three sectors away."

### Scene 3: The Spider in the Web

- **Key Event:** The negotiation attempt.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica backs away, her hand hovering over her datapad. She triggers her kill-switch protocol—a script designed to crash the local patient database and cause chaos. It's her only leverage.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Back off! I've got a worm in the system. One button, and I wipe the patient records for this entire wing. Transplants, life support, blood types—all gone. I'll scramble it so bad you'll be giving insulin to heart patients."

- **Key Event:** The bluff called.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane doesn't flinch. He doesn't even blink. He takes a step down the stairs, his movements fluid and silent. He tilts his head, analyzing her heart rate, her pupil dilation, her sweat.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "No, you won't."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Try me, shiny."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I have seen your profile. You scavenge to fix things. You spent three days repairing a water pump for a sector you don't even live in. You are a thief, yes. But you are not a killer. You have the hands of a surgeon, Miss Ward. Not a butcher."

- **Key Event:** The revelation.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane raises his hand. The skin of his palm ripples. A tiny, silver beetle—a nano-construct—crawls out from his tear duct, skittering across his ocular lens before disappearing into his robes. He is not just a mage; he is a host. The Legion Swarm lives beneath his skin.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Real, primal fear hits her. This isn't a Warden. This is a Prelate. One of the Seven. A monster who wears holiness like a costume.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Represents Gluttony (Minister of Charity). He consumes everything—information, power, biology—while pretending to give back crumbs. He is a black hole in white robes.

- **Key Event:** The destruction.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane moves with impossible speed. Before Angelica can tap the screen, he is in front of her. He grabs her wrist. He doesn't break it. He gently peels the Haptic Glove from her hand. He examines the circuitry, admiring the crude ingenuity of the wiring. Then, he crushes it in his fist. Metal squeals and glass shatters. He drops the wreckage to the floor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Resistors made from toaster coils. Processors salvaged from a trash compactor. It is crude, ugly, unauthorized... and utterly brilliant. You are wasting your potential on petty theft."

### Scene 4: The Offer

- **Key Event:** The leverage.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane reaches into his robes and produces a single, crystal vial. Inside, a blue liquid swirls with bioluminescent light. It is the Grade-A Steroid solution. The cure. He walks to the waste chute—the incinerator shaft that drops straight to the planet's core. He dangles the vial over the edge.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't! That's for my brother!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "The boy. Leo. Acute Particulate Fibrosis. Genetic rejection of the atmosphere. A tragedy. This vial? It will buy him a month. Maybe two. Then you will be back here, stealing again. And next time, the guards will just shoot you."

- **Key Event:** The proposal.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane turns to her. The blue light of the vial reflects in his silver eyes. He offers her a deal. It is a devil's bargain.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I am offering you a permanent solution, Miss Ward. Not a patch. A cure."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "What do you want?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I want you to enter the Iron Selection. The Academy classes start tomorrow. Squad Iron is... under-staffed. We have an opening."

- **Key Event:** The odds.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica laughs, a harsh, jagged sound. Everyone knows about Squad Iron. The suicide squad. The rejects.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Squad Iron? The mortality rate is 88%. You're asking me to volunteer for a firing squad."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I am asking you to survive. If you graduate—if you become a Warden—you will have access to the Genetic Forge. You can rewrite the boy's DNA. You can fix his lungs permanently. No more inhalers. No more sickness. He will be able to breathe the air."

- **Key Event:** The motive.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane steps closer. He looms over her.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Reveals his true interest. He doesn't care about the theft. He cares about the anomaly. Angelica is a "Null"—someone invisible to the Resonance. A blank slate.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I don't want a mage, Miss Ward. I have thousands of mages. I want a variable. I want to see if that mind of yours—that chaotic, brilliant, scavenging mind—can survive a real challenge. I want to see if you can break my Academy the way you broke my firewall."

- **Key Event:** The acceptance.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane tosses the vial. It arcs through the air. Angelica lunges, catching it inches from the floor. She clutches it to her chest, breathing hard. Vane turns to leave, his robes swirling.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "The shuttle leaves at dawn from Platform 7. Do not be late. You treat the law like a suggestion, Miss Ward. Fortunately, so do I."
