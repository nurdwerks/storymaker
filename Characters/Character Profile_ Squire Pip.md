# Character Profile: Squire Pip

**Archetype:** The Student / The Hero-Worshipper
**True Sin:** WRATH (His jealousy over Kaelen's attention manifests as unthinking hostility toward Angelica).
**Virtue Mask:** ENTHUSIASM (He plays the part of the perfect, eager squire to hide his petty nature).

## I. Role in the Story

Squire Pip is a young boy training to be a knight under Kaelen's guidance. He represents the cycle of "hero-worship" that keeps the noble order alive.

- **The Jealousy:** He looks at Kaelen with religious devotion and views Angelica as a "witch" who is trying to steal his hero's soul.
- **The Stings:** Kaelen's patience and gentle mentorship with the boy make Angelica realize the kind of softness Kaelen is capable of—a softness she feels he denies to her.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Traumatic Awakening. During a skirmish, Pip is forced to kill for the first time to save Kaelen's life. He succeeds, but the experience shatters his "heroic" illusions of knighthood, leaving him shell-shocked and silent.
- **Impact on Kaelen Night:** Kaelen feels a deep, agonizing guilt for "corrupting" the boy. He stops being a gentle mentor and becomes a harsh, demanding drill sergeant, trying to "harden" Pip so he won't be broken by the world again.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Innocence" of the guard is gone. Seeing the once-bright boy turn into a hollow-eyed soldier-in-training makes the rest of the guard realize the true, dark cost of their service to the Night family.

**Event Location:** Book 2, Chapter 16
**Defining Quote:** _"I... I got him. I saved you, my Lord."_
