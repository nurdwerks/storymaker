## Chapter 12: The Hull Breach

### Scene 1: The Swarm

- **Key Event:** The main Sphere releases thousands of smaller Shards. They look like a swarm of black locusts.

### Scene 2: The Decompression

- **Key Event:** Multiple hull breaches occur in Sectors 5, 6, and 7. Atmosphere vents into space.
- **Key Event:** Emergency bulkheads slam shut, sealing off crew sections.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She works the tactical map, ordering the sealing of sections even though she knows stragglers are still inside. She chooses the many over the few.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Seal it. God forgive us. Seal it."

### Scene 3: The Bridge

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes the Shards are harvesting raw material. They aren't just destroying; they are mining the generation ship.
