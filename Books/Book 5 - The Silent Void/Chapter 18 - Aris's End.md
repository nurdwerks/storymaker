## Chapter 18: Aris's End

### Scene 1: The Event Horizon

- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris is pulled toward the singularity.
- **Detailed Description:** In the ruined bio-dome of Sector X, the gravity stabilizers have failed completely due to the sabotage. A micro-singularity, the result of Aris's failed experiment to tap into the "Zero-Point" energy field, hovers in the center of the room. It is a ball of absolute darkness, about the size of a grapefruit, surrounded by a violent accretion disk of debris—glass, metal, soil, and plant matter—spinning at supersonic speeds. Aris, caught in the expanding gravity well, hangs suspended in the air. His lab coat flaps violently toward the void, the fabric tearing away in strips and vanishing. His feet are already crossing the event horizon. The light around him bends, stretching his image into a surreal, elongated shape, like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. The sound is a low, thrumming vibration that is felt in the teeth rather than heard, a localized earthquake.
- **Internal Conflict:** Aris is not afraid. He is ecstatic. He is seeing the "face of God"—the raw, unadulterated mathematics of the universe. He realizes that the singularity is not just a hole in space; it is an engine. It is the power source for the *Zenith*'s legendary Star-Tear Drive. He has solved the riddle that drove him mad. The realization fills him with a transcendent joy that overrides the physical pain of his body being pulled apart. He feels vindicated.

- **Key Event:** Aris experiences spaghettification.
- **Detailed Description:** As gravity grabs his legs, his physical form begins to stretch. Bones snap and elongate with sickening pops. Blood vessels burst, but the blood doesn't drip; it flows in straight lines into the black hole. His mind remains lucid, fueled by the adrenaline of discovery and the distortion of time near the event horizon. He sees the equations of the universe written in the swirling dust. He realizes he cannot save himself, but he can save the data. The data is more important than the vessel.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — He laughs, a wet, gurgling sound that bubbles up from his collapsing chest. He accepts his death as the price of knowledge. He raises his hand, holding his datapad, his fingers gripping it so tightly the casing cracks.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris (Whispered):** "It's all... so simple. The curve... the infinite curve. Tell the Captain... I archived everything. The answer is in the hole! I am the variable! I am the key!"

### Scene 2: The Explanation

- **Key Event:** Aris explains his theory to a hallucination.
- **Detailed Description:** As his brain floods with DMT and lack of oxygen, Aris hallucinates that he is back in the Academy. He sees his old professor standing in the debris field. He explains his findings with manic energy, gesturing with his free hand while his legs dissolve into atoms. He explains that the singularity is a doorway, not a wall. It is a bridge.
- **Internal Conflict:** He feels a moment of regret that he won't be able to publish the paper. It is the vanity of a scholar, persisting even in death. He wants the credit.

### Scene 3: The Datapad

- **Key Event:** Aris throws the datapad to Angelica.
- **Detailed Description:** With his last ounce of strength, Aris calculates the trajectory. He throws the datapad backward, against the pull of gravity. It is a perfect throw, aided by a momentary fluctuation in the field caused by the collapse of a support pillar. The device spins through the air, clearing the deadly debris field. It is a silver streak against the chaos.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica, clinging to a support strut near the door, watches him die. She feels a mix of horror and respect. She hated his methods—the experiments, the callousness—but she cannot deny his genius. She knows that without that pad, they are lost.

- **Key Event:** Angelica catches the datapad.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica reaches out, snatching the device from the air just before it hits the wall. The impact bruises her hand. She looks up just in time to see Aris vanish. He is not crushed; he is simply stretched until he becomes a line of atoms, a thread of light spiraling into the black. He is consumed by his own creation. The singularity flares once, as if satisfied with the meal.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She clutches the pad to her chest, feeling its warmth. She realizes that Aris didn't just give her data; he gave her the map to the exit. She resolves that his madness will serve their survival. She will not let the knowledge die with him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He didn't die. He just went to the library. Goodbye, Doctor. You crazy bastard."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "The man was a genius and a fool. But mostly a genius. Let's not follow him into the drain."

### Scene 4: The Aftermath

- **Key Event:** The singularity collapses.
- **Detailed Description:** With Aris gone, the singularity becomes unstable. It pulses once, emitting a shockwave of distorted gravity that knocks the survivors to the floor. Then, it evaporates, leaving a vacuum where the lab bench used to be. The silence that follows is deafening. The air rushes back into the space with a thunderclap.
- **Internal Conflict:** The team picks themselves up. They are battered, covered in dust. They look at the empty space. They realize the stakes have changed. They are not just fighting for territory; they are fighting forces they barely understand.
