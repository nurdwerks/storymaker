# Character Profile: Bjorn the Breaker

**Archetype:** The Brute / The Blood-Brother
**True Sin:** GLUTTONY (Of life, violence, and physical dominance).
**Virtue Mask:** BRAVERY (He claims his bullying and wrestling are just about "Toughening up" the weak).

## I. Role in the Story

Bjorn the Breaker is a massive warrior and Ragnar’s blood-brother. He represents the raw, physical heart of the Warband and their disregard for anything that isn't "strong."

- **The Contrast:** His easy, physical affection for Ragnar—the wrestling, the drinking—highlights the lack of warmth and family in Angelica’s life.
- **The Bully:** He calls Angelica "Little Stick" and laughs when she struggles to lift a weapon, dismissing her magic as a sign of physical inadequacy.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Catastrophic Injury / Loss of Strength. During a raid, Bjorn's legs are crushed by a falling Zenith structure. He survives but is no longer "The Breaker." He is forced to watch the tribe move on without him, relegated to the role of a "cripple."
- **Impact on Ragnar:** Ragnar is forced to choose between his blood-brother and the survival of the tribe. His decision to leave Bjorn behind (or relegate him to a minor role) is a brutal demonstration of the Savage King's philosophy: strength is the only currency.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Brute" is gone. The younger warriors see Bjorn’s fall as an opportunity to take his spot, leading to a state of constant, aggressive competition within the Warband.

**Event Location:** Book 6, Chapter 14
**Defining Quote:** _"The Breaker is dead. You are just Bjorn now."_ — Ragnar
