## Chapter 2: The New Rules

### Scene 1: The Scavenge

- **Key Event:** The landing.
- **Detailed Description:** _CRUNCH._ The sound of impact is sickening. Angelica hits the bottom of the impact crater in Sector 4. The landing is not graceful; it is a collision. They crash through layers of rusted corrugated metal, rotting wood, and ancient refuse before slamming into the deep, viscous mud. She rolls, coughing violently. The air is thick and humid, heavy with the taste of sulfur, methane, and unwashed bodies. It is the smell of the Undercity, amplified a thousand times.

- **Key Event:** The injury.
- **Detailed Description:** Zephyr lands next to her, getting tangled in his parachute lines. He hits the ground hard, groaning as he clutches his side. His face has gone a dusty shade of grey.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "I think I broke a rib. Maybe two. Add it to the tab."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Can you walk? We can't stay here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "If walking involves screaming, yes. Help me up."

- **Key Event:** The native.
- **Detailed Description:** They are not alone in the crater. A figure is crawling through the debris toward them, moving with the jerky, desperate speed of an insect. It is a man, skeletal and filthy, wearing rags wrapped around his blistered feet. He ignores Angelica and Zephyr completely. He moves toward a body that fell with them—Lord Vermillion, a minor noble from House Ignis who was sucked out of the airlock during the descent.

- **Key Event:** The attempted theft.
- **Detailed Description:** Vermillion is alive, writhing in the mud with a compound fracture in his leg. He is screaming in highborn indignation. The scavenger doesn't care; he grabs Vermillion's fine leather boots and starts pulling them off his feet.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Vermillion:** "Get off me, peasant! I am Lord Vermillion! I command you! Do you know who I am? I am a Peer of the Realm!"
  - **Detailed Description:** The scavenger pulls out a rusty, serrated knife. He doesn't know what a Peer of the Realm is, and he doesn't care. He wants the boots. They are worth more than Vermillion's life in this place.

### Scene 2: The Kill

- **Key Event:** The intervention.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica moves to intervene, instinctively reaching for the holster at her hip, but her pistol is gone—lost during the chaotic fall. She steps forward anyway.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Stop! Leave him alone!"

- **Key Event:** The strike.
- **Detailed Description:** Before she can take another step, a blur of silver motion drops from the shadows of the wreckage above. It is Ria. She lands directly on the scavenger's back, her knees driving him face-first into the mud. _CRACK._ There is no hesitation, no warning. She snaps his neck with a single, efficient twist of her hands. The sound is wet and final.

- **Key Event:** The pragmatism.
- **Detailed Description:** The scavenger goes limp instantly. Ria doesn't look at the body; to her, it is already debris. She pulls the boots off the dead man's feet herself. She throws them to Lisbet, who is shivering nearby in the mud, her feet bare and bleeding.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Put them on. Your soles were worn through."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You killed him. You didn't even warn him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He was armed. He was hostile. And Lisbet needs shoes. It was an even trade."

### Scene 3: The Speech

- **Key Event:** The delusion.
- **Detailed Description:** Lord Vermillion is sobbing with relief, mistaking Ria's violence for rescue. He reaches out to her with a bloody hand, clutching at her hem.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Vermillion:** "Thank you! Thank you, citizen! You saved me! I will reward you! My house is powerful! I will make you rich! I will give you a title!"

- **Key Event:** The conflict.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica kneels beside him, examining the leg. She grips his collar to steady him and tears a strip from her own shirt to make a tourniquet.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He's bleeding bad. Femoral artery might be nicked. We need to bind this tight."
  - **Detailed Description:** Ria steps in front of her, casting a long shadow. She blocks Angelica's hands. "No."

- **Key Event:** The logic.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks up, confused and angry.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "What do you mean 'no'? He's hurt. We help him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Leave him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We can't just leave him here to die."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He's noise. He's calorie-negative. We can't carry him. We can't feed him. If you heal him, he just starves slower. He is dead weight, Ward."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lord Vermillion:** "You can't! I am a Lord! You have a duty to serve me!"

### Scene 4: The Law

- **Key Event:** The proclamation.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria climbs up onto a pile of twisted metal, looking down at the huddled survivors of their group—Angelica, Zephyr, Lisbet, Hatcher. She addresses them all, her voice cutting through the humid air.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Listen to me! Zenith laws are for full bellies. Down here, the only law is caloric intake. You work, you eat. You steal, you die."

- **Key Event:** The judgment.
- **Detailed Description:** She points a finger at Vermillion, who is pale with shock.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He acts like he matters. He doesn't metal-scavenge, he doesn't fight, he doesn't know the terrain. He can't work. So he doesn't eat. And we don't carry him."
  - **Detailed Description:** She turns her gaze to Angelica. Her eyes are not cruel, but they are terrifyingly devoid of pity. It is the gaze of a survivor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "There are no seats on the council here, Ward. There is only the food chain. Are you eating, or are you meat?"

- **Key Event:** The choice.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica looks at the dying noble, who is now whimpering in the mud. Then she looks at the dark, hungry city rising around them—the twisting pipes, the steam vents, the shadows that seem to have teeth. She realizes Ria is right. Idealism is a luxury they left in the sky. Down here, it is a death sentence.

- **Key Event:** The transition.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up slowly. She wipes the mud from her hands. She steps away from Vermillion.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm eating."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Good. Now strip him. His coat is wool. We can use it for blankets."

- **Key Event:** The final act.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica hesitates for one second, feeling the last piece of her old self breaking. Then she bends down and takes the coat from the sobbing man.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Morality is a luxury we left upstairs. Move out."
