## Chapter 2: The New Rules

### Scene 1: The Scavenge / Sector 4 Impact Crater

- **Key Event:** _CRUNCH._
- **Key Event:** Angelica hits the bottom of the crater. Mud. Trash. Sludge.
- **Key Event:** She rolls, coughing. The air tastes of sulfur and rot. The Undercity.
- **Key Event:** Zephyr lands next to her. He groans, clutching his side.
- **Key Event:** "I think I broke a rib," he wheezes. "Add it to the tab."
- **Key Event:** They aren't alone.
- **Key Event:** A figure is crawling through the debris. A scavenger. Rags wrapped around his feet.
- **Key Event:** He is pulling at the boots of a body.
- **Key Event:** The body moves. It's Lord Vermillion, a minor noble who fell with them.
- **Key Event:** "Get off me, peasant!" Vermillion shrieks. "I am Lord Vermillion! I command you! Do you know who I am? I am a Peer of the Realm!"
- **Key Event:** The scavenger ignores him. He pulls out a rusty knife. He wants the boots.

### Scene 2: The Kill / The Crater

- **Key Event:** Angelica moves to intervene. "Stop!"
- **Key Event:** Before she can take a step, a blur of motion drops from the shadows.
- **Key Event:** Ria.
- **Key Event:** She lands on the scavenger's back.
- **Key Event:** _CRACK._
- **Key Event:** She snaps his neck. Efficient. ruthless.
- **Key Event:** The scavenger goes limp.
- **Key Event:** Ria doesn't look at the body. She pulls the boots off.
- **Key Event:** She throws them to Lisbet, who is shivering nearby.
- **Key Event:** "Put them on," Ria says. "Your soles were worn through."
- **Key Event:** Angelica stares. "You killed him."
- **Key Event:** "He was armed," Ria says. "And Lisbet needs shoes."

### Scene 3: The Speech / The Crater

- **Key Event:** Lord Vermillion is sobbing. "Thank you! Thank you, citizen! I will reward you! My house is powerful!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica kneels beside him. "He's bleeding. We need to bind this."
- **Key Event:** Ria steps in front of her. "No."
- **Key Event:** "What?"
- **Key Event:** "Leave him," Ria says.
- **Key Event:** "He's hurt!"
- **Key Event:** "He's noise," Ria says flatly. "He's calorie-negative. We can't carry him. We can't feed him. If you heal him, he just starves slower. Leave him."
- **Key Event:** Vermillion stares at them. "You can't! I am a Lord!"

### Scene 4: The Law / The Crater Edge

- **Key Event:** Ria climbs up onto a pile of twisted metal. She looks down at them.
- **Key Event:** "Zenith laws are for full bellies," she announces. "Down here, the only law is caloric intake. You work, you eat. You steal, you die."
- **Key Event:** She points at Vermillion. "He can't work. So he doesn't eat."
- **Key Event:** She looks at Angelica. "There are no seats on the council here, Ward. There is only the food chain. Are you eating, or are you meat?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the dying noble. Then she looks at the dark, hungry city around them.
- **Key Event:** She stands up. She wipes the mud from her hands.
- **Key Event:** "I'm eating," she says.
- **Key Event:** "Good," Ria says. "Now strip him. His coat is wool. We can use it."
- **Key Event:** Angelica hesitates for one second. Then she bends down.
- **Key Event:** "Morality is a luxury we left upstairs," she whispers. "Move."
