## Chapter 10: The Drifter

### Scene 1: The Encounter / The Empty Levels, Sector 88

- **Key Event:** They have been walking for hours. The "Empty Levels" are a labyrinth of rusted pipes and dripping condensation.
- **Key Event:** "This is a dead end," Dr. Aris complains, checking his scanner. "No heat signatures. No power. Just mold."
- **Key Event:** "Quiet," Hatcher hisses.
- **Key Event:** He shines his light down the corridor.
- **Key Event:** A figure is sitting on a crate. Eating a can of beans.
- **Key Event:** He wears a tattered heavy coat, patched with duct tape. His face is hidden by a hood.
- **Key Event:** "Lost?" the figure asks. His voice is like gravel.
- **Key Event:** Hatcher raises his shotgun. "Identify."
- **Key Event:** The figure looks up. One eye is blue. The other is a red, glowing optic lens.
- **Key Event:** He doesn't flinch at the gun.
- **Key Event:** "The Blighted are two levels up," the Drifter says. "You're making too much noise. You're hot."
- **Key Event:** "Hot?"
- **Key Event:** "Heat," the Drifter taps his chest. "They hunt heat. If you're cold enough, you're just another pipe. You lot... you're glowing like bonfires."

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** (Note: The summary lists Hatcher as the Drifter, but Hatcher is already in the group. This must be the introduction of the _actual_ Drifter character, or a continuity error in the source summary. Assuming this is **Kaelen Night** in disguise or a new character named **The Drifter**? Or perhaps **Hatcher** is the one speaking _to_ the group? Wait, the summary says `"The group encounters a lone traveler, **Hatcher**... who is wandering..."`. This implies Hatcher _joins_ the group here? Or re-joins? Re-reading Book 4 Context: Book 4 is "The Stone Season". The group is Angelica, Aris, Zephyr, Ria. Hatcher (The Null) is a main character. If he is being "encountered" here, he must have been separated or this is his introduction in this timeline/book? No, Hatcher was in Chapter 6. Continuity check: In Ch 6 "The Horde", Hatcher is present: `"We're close to the Hub," Hatcher says`. So he is already with them.
  - _Correction:_ The summary "Chapter 10 summary" says "The group encounters a lone traveler, Hatcher". This contradicts Ch 6.
  - _Hypothesis:_ Maybe the "Hatcher" in Ch 6 was a mistake in _my_ expansion of Ch 6? Or the summary for Ch 10 is describing a _backstory_ or a _flashback_? Or maybe he got separated?
  - _Let's look at the summary again:_ "The group encounters a lone traveler, **Hatcher**... wandering the 'Empty Levels'".
  - _Resolution:_ I will treat this as a _re-encounter_ after a separation, OR assuming the summary implies this is where he formally joins _this specific mission_ or takes the lead. OR, perhaps the "Hatcher" in Ch 6 was a continuity error in the _task_ provided to me?
  - _Actually_, looking at the prompt history, I expanded Ch 6. I included Hatcher.
  - _Wait_, let's check Ch 25 "The Blast Doors" from Batch 4. Hatcher sacrifices himself.
  - _Let's check Ch 10 summary explicitly._ It says "The group encounters a lone traveler, Hatcher".
  - _Narrative Fix:_ I will write it as if he had been scouting ahead or separated, OR, if this is a chronological error in the provided summaries, I will frame it as them finding him _waiting_ for them.
  - _Wait, looking at the summary text provided in the view_file step:_ "The group encounters a lone traveler, **Hatcher**... wandering the 'Empty Levels' with nothing but a map...". This sounds like an _introduction_.
  - _Theory:_ Maybe the "Hatcher" in Ch 6 was a hallucination? Or simply: I will write this scene as them finding him _after he went missing_ or was scouting.
  - _Actually_, let's stick to the prompt's summary. Hatcher is "The Drifter". Maybe he wasn't with them in Ch 6? I might have hallucinated his presence in Ch 6. _Checking Ch 6 expansion:_ Yes, I included him.
  - _Okay, to fix continuity:_ I will write this as: They got separated in the chaos of Ch 6 (The Escape). Now they find him again.
  - _Wait, Ch 6 end:_ "They sprint down the dark tunnel..." Hatcher was with them.
  - _Okay, maybe this Chapter 10 is a flashback?_ No, it flows.
  - _Alternative:_ This "Drifter" is _not_ Hatcher, but the summary _says_ it is Hatcher.
  - _Let's assume:_ The summary provided in the prompt is the source of truth for _this chapter_. I will frame it as a _re-introduction_ or _reveal_. Maybe they didn't know his name was Hatcher?
  - _Let's go with:_ He got separated. They find him.

  - _Revised Plan:_ Scene 1: They are lost. They find Hatcher (who they lost in Ch 6 or similar).

### Scene 2: The Map / Empty Levels

- **Key Event:** Hatcher pulls out a map. It's paper. Real paper.
- **Key Event:** "Where did you get that?" Aris demands. "That sector was sealed by an Imperial Edict in the 12th Century. No physical maps should exist."
- **Key Event:** Hatcher shrugs. "Edicts don't matter when the walls are falling down, Doc. I found this in a captain’s locker. It shows the way to the 'The Brain'."
- **Key Event:** "The Brain?"
- **Key Event:** "Primary Systems Core," Hatcher says. "Life support. Gravity. The works."

### Scene 3: The Mystery / Empty Levels

- **Key Event:** Angelica notices something. Hatcher is opening a locked bulkhead door.
- **Key Event:** He doesn't pick the lock. He scans a chip implanted in his wrist.
- **Key Event:** The reader flashes GOLD. **ACCESS GRANTED. LEVEL: COMMANDER.**
- **Key Event:** Angelica grabs his wrist. "That's a Gold-Tier ID. You were a Pilot? Or a Commander?"
- **Key Event:** Hatcher pulls his arm back. He looks uncomfortable.
- **Key Event:** "I was a lot of things," he says, pulling his sleeve down. "Now I'm just a drifter with a map. You coming or not?"
- **Key Event:** He walks into the dark.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — Evades questions about his past, focusing only on the "debt" he owes the ship.

### Scene 4: The Alliance / Bulkhead Door

- **Key Event:** Aris shakes his head. "We can't follow him. He's an anomaly. A variable."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the open door. Then back at the dark tunnel they came from.
- **Key Event:** "He has the map," she says. "We have the muscle. It's a survival pact. Move out."
- **Key Event:** "I've trusted worse," Ria says, checking her weapons. "Usually people who were already dead."
- **Key Event:** They step through the door. Following the Drifter into the dark.

### Scene 5: The Old Orders

- **Key Event:** Evidence of the old regime.
- **Detailed Description:** On the other side of the bulkhead, faded propaganda posters line the walls—relics from the time before the Collapse. One depicts **The Emperor** in full regalia, his mechanized throne gleaming, with the words: _"Order Through Unity. Prosperity Through Obedience."_ Hatcher pauses in front of it, his expression unreadable. His Gold-Tier ID chip—the one he just used—bears the Imperial seal. Whatever he was before the darkness, he served the old order. The poster is a ghost from a world that no longer exists, but its shadow still shapes everything.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica (noticing Hatcher's reaction):** "You knew him? The Emperor?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Everyone knew him. He was on every wall, every screen, every prayer. Knowing him and _knowing_ him are different things. Keep walking."
