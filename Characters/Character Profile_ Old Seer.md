# Character Profile: Old Seer

**Archetype:** The Mystic / The Blind Prophet
**True Sin:** SLOTH (Relying on old bones and ancient riddles rather than facing the complicated truth of the present).
**Virtue Mask:** WISDOM (He frames his suspicion of the unknown as "Spiritual Prophecy").

## I. Role in the Story

Old Seer is a blind mystic who throws bones for Ragnar. He is the guardian of the tribe's spiritual fears and their connection to the unseen world.

- **The Prophecy:** He points a finger at Angelica and warns Ragnar to "Beware the Golden Eye," poisoning the King's trust in her.
- **The Authority:** Ragnar trusts the Seer's riddles more than Angelica's logic, showing that in the Warband, the "old ways" of fear will always trump the "new ways" of knowledge.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** False Prophecy / Betrayal. The Seer is caught "faking" a prophecy from the bones to manipulate Ragnar into attacking a specific target that the Seer has a personal grudge against. His holy status is revealed as a fraud.
- **Impact on Ragnar:** Ragnar realizes that for years he has been a puppet of an old man's lies. He doesn't kill the Seer, but he strips him of his authority and leaves him to wander the Silt, lost and forgotten.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Old Ways" are broken. The Warband loses its spiritual core, leading to a state of existential dread as they realize they have no "divine" guidance and are truly alone in a hostile world.

**Event Location:** Book 6, Chapter 18
**Defining Quote:** _"She cured me with dirt. You killed them with lies."_ — Ragnar

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 6 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | She rushes back to Ragnar's tent. The Old Seer is there, shaking a bone rattle over the dying chief and chanting about evil spirits. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | He points a shaking finger at the Old Seer, who stands apart, glaring. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 18 | Detailed Description | The Seer is dragged away, screaming curses at the Sky-Witch. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 03 | Detailed Description | Rust, the blind seer of the ship's underbelly, sits in the dark. He does not need eyes to see the arrival of the End. He tilts his head, listening to the vibration of the ship's hull. Usually, the *Aeterna* hums with the life of a city—footsteps, pumps, laughter. Now, the hull vibrates with a low, dissonance frequency. It feels like the ship is shivering. Rust smells the air—recycled ozone, stale food, and something else. A metallic, sterile scent. The smell of "nothing." |
