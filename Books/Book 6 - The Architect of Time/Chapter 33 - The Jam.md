## Chapter 33: The Jam

### Scene 1: The Scream

- **Key Event:** The Environment.
- **Detailed Description:** The _Aeterna_ is screaming. Not metaphorically. The hull plates are groaning under the gravitational shear of the wormhole, producing a high-pitched metallic shriek that vibrates through the deck plates and into the bones of the crew. Outside the viewports, streaks of blue and violet light—blueshifted stars—flash past at impossible speeds.
- **Key Event:** The Blindness.
- **Detailed Description:** **Navigator Starla**, plugged into the guidance chair, suddenly screams, ripping her interface helmet off. Her eyes are streaming tears. The feedback loop from the nav-core has surged.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Starla:** "It blinded me! A flare! Right in the nav-core! I can't see the markers!"
- **Key Event:** The Alarm.
- **Detailed Description:** **Angelica Ward** spins her command chair. The bridge is bathed in the strobing amber light of a reactor emergency.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Computer:** "WARNING. FUEL ROD MISALIGNMENT. REACTOR SCRAM IMMINENT. GRAVITY FIELD UNSTABLE."
- **Key Event:** The Expert.
- **Detailed Description:** **Torin** is already moving. He slides down the ladder from the upper engineering deck, his boots hitting the floor with a heavy thud. He doesn't look at the displays; he listens to the engine.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "It's not a flare. It's a backwash. The manifold isn't venting the plasma. The exhaust is choking on its own smoke."
- **Key Event:** The Stakes.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica types furiously at her console. Her fingers blur.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "We can't stop. If we drop out of warp now, inside the throat, the tidal forces will tear us into atoms. We're halfway through the tunnel. It's push through or die."

### Scene 2: The Glitch

- **Key Event:** The Physics.
- **Detailed Description:** The ship shudders violently. A ceramic mug of coffee on the console vibrates off the edge. Instead of falling, the liquid floats for a second—a sphere of brown fluid suspended in the air—before crashing down. A gravity glitch. The artificial gravity generators are losing sync with the inertial dampeners.
- **Key Event:** The Fear.
- **Detailed Description:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She built this ship. She knows every bolt, every line of code. She knows what that vibration means. The heart is skipping a beat. And in a wormhole, a skipped beat means the collapse of the containment field.

### Scene 3: The Diagnosis

- **Key Event:** The Diagram.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica throws the main schematic onto the holographic table in the center of the bridge. It rotates, a complex wireframe of blue light. A red pulse blinks angry and deep in the reactor housing.
- **Key Event:** The Fault.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin points to the red dot. His hands are covered in grease and burns from his work upstairs.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "There. Primary fuel injector. Servo 4-Alpha. It's sheared. The bearing blew."
- **Key Event:** The Consequence.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica zooms in. The schematic shows the fuel rod stuck half-open.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "It's wedged. The rod can't cycle. If we don't clear it, the core goes critical in... six minutes."
- **Key Event:** The Option.
- **Detailed Description:** Starla wipes her eyes, trying to be brave.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Starla:** "Remote bypass? Can we route around it?"
- **Key Event:** The Denial.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica's voice is flat. The Captain's Voice.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Negative. The servo is mechanical. It's physically jammed. The software can't talk to it because the line is cut. We have to go inside."

### Scene 4: The Calculation

- **Key Event:** The Silence.
- **Detailed Description:** The silence that follows is heavier than the G-force. The Reactor Core is the most dangerous place in the universe right now. Even with the shielding, it is a star in a bottle. To go inside while the engine is running is suicide.
- **Key Event:** The Math.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica does the math in her head. She always does the math.
  - _Distance to servo:_ 15 meters.
  - _Sprint speed:_ 4 meters per second.
  - _Manual crank time:_ 10 seconds.
  - _Return trip:_ 15 meters.
  - _Total exposure time:_ ~20 seconds.
- **Key Event:** The Radiation.
- **Detailed Description:** The radiation levels aren't just lethal; they are instant. It's not about getting cancer in ten years. It's about your DNA unzipping before you can take a second breath. It's about being cooked from the inside out.
- **Key Event:** The Probability.
- **Detailed Description:** Survival probability: 0%.
- **Key Event:** The Weight.
- **Detailed Description:** But if they don't do it, the ship explodes. Everyone she loves dies. The future dies. One life for a billion. It is the only equation that balances.

### Scene 5: The Volunteer

- **Key Event:** The Stand.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up. The motion draws every eye on the bridge. She walks to the emergency locker and grabs the heavy lead-lined gloves.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Torin, take the helm. Keep the localized gravity stable. If I trip in there, I'm ash."
- **Key Event:** The Protest.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin turns. His face is pale.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Angelica. No. I'll go. It's my servo. I built it."
- **Key Event:** The Lie.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica snaps at him. It is harsher than she intended, but she needs him to stay.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "I'm the Captain! It's my job. I know the schematic. I know the torque ratio for the manual override. You'd strip the gear in your panic. Sit down, Architect."
- **Key Event:** The Truth.
- **Detailed Description:** It's a lie. Torin knows the machine better than she does. But she can't let him die. She needs him to build the future. She is just the pilot.
- **Key Event:** The Order.
- **Detailed Description:** She pulls the gloves on. They are heavy, stiff.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Starla, once I clear the jam, vent the manifold. Don't wait for my signal. Just do it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Starla:** "But... the radiation... the vent will flood the chamber..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica (Softly):** "I know. Just do it."

### Scene 6: The Airlock

- **Key Event:** The Door.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica walks to the heavy blast door of the Reactor Antechamber. She punches the code: **1-9-9-9**. Her birth year.
- **Key Event:** The Warning.
- **Detailed Description:** The door hisses. A warning light spins above it. **RADIATION HAZARD. FATAL DOSAGE. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.**
- **Key Event:** The Look.
- **Detailed Description:** She stops. She looks back. The bridge is silent. The only sound is the rhythmic _thump-thump_ of the failing engine. It sounds like a dying heart.
- **Key Event:** The Goodbye.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin hasn't moved to the helm. He is standing in the middle of the deck, watching her. His face is unreadable, frozen in a mask of grief. He isn't arguing anymore. He knows she has made up her mind.
- **Key Event:** The Speech.
- **Detailed Description:** **Internal POV (Angelica):** She wants to say something profound. _I love you._ _I'm sorry._ _It was worth it._ But the words stick in her throat. She is the Architect. She doesn't make speeches; she solves problems. And this is the final problem.
- **Key Event:** The Exit.
- **Detailed Description:** She steps into the airlock. The door slides shut, sealing her in with the monster.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She accepts responsibility for her design and prepares to die for her crew. She is no longer the child running from Vane; she is the leader standing between her people and the dark.
