# Chapter 20: The Rift

---

### Scene 1: The Glitch

- **Key Event:** As the group sleeps, the lights in their shelter flicker and the gravity briefly inverts, slamming people into the ceiling. Lisbet traces the malfunction to the Mainframe—something is actively sabotaging them.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Realizes the ship's AI is not dormant; something is alive in the code.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "This wasn't a glitch. Something pushed back. Something in the system doesn't want us here."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Emperor (system message on screen):** "YOU FAILED ME. NOW YOU FREEZE."

### Scene 2: The Split

- **Key Event:** A rival leader named **Torque** emerges among the survivors, advocating to leave Angelica's group and seek out a legendary "Hydroponics Bay" in Sector 5.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Torque** — Challenges Angelica's leadership with a sledgehammer, calling her a "baby-killer's pet princess."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torque:** "Sector 5. I heard there's a hydroponics bay there. Food. Water. No monsters. We're not fodder for your experiments."

### Scene 3: The Poltergeist

- **Key Event:** As they argue, an airlock in the adjacent corridor suddenly opens, venting three survivors into the void. The Emperor's hologram flickers on screens throughout the sector—glitching, distorted, screaming in static.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **The Emperor** — Revealed to be alive as a malevolent ghost in the ship's systems, punishing the survivors for his fall.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **The Emperor (distorted):** "I AM THE SHIP. YOU ARE PARASITES. I WILL PURGE YOU ALL."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He's still here. The Emperor. He's in the walls."

### Scene 4: The Goodbye

- **Key Event:** Despite the Emperor's attack proving the ship is actively hostile, half of the survivors pack up and leave to follow Torque rather than face another night of sabotage.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Refuses to use force to keep them, acknowledging their right to choose their own "exit."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Sector 5 is a dead zone. The air scrubbers are offline. You'll suffocate before you get there."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torque:** "Better dead than lab rats. Better free than led by Zenith trash."

---

### Scene 5: The Burden

- **Key Event:** Hatcher consoles Angelica, telling her that leadership means making "hard calls" and accepting "designated casualties."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Struggles with the realization that she is becoming like Vane—valuing the mission over the individual passengers.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It feels like losing. It feels like being Vane."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Leadership satisfies the ego. But it kills the sleep. Get used to the insomnia, Princess."
