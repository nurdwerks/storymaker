## I. Role in the Story

The General of the Praetorian Guard is a gold-armored giant who stands at the foot of the Imperial Throne. He is the physical embodiment of the state's military might and absolute loyalty.

- **The Obedience:** He only takes orders from the Emperor, rendering everyone else in the room—including the protagonists—irrelevant to him.
- **The Wall:** He is a statue of loyalty that excludes all others. If Angelica speaks, he doesn't even blink. He represents the silent, immovable wall of the establishment that she is fighting against.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 29: The Vacuum](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2176-2185)
- **Defining Quote:** "The Order remains." (Spoken by General, reveals flaw: WRATH/MACHINE-LIKE OBEDIENCE)
