## I. Role in the Story

Lab Assistant Igor is the frantic, eager assistant who fetches samples for Prelate Vane. He represents the fanatical devotion of those who find identity in the service of a "great man."

- **The Fanaticism:** He worships Vane and treats the Prelate's tools as holy relics.
- **The Warning:** He hisses at Angelica if she even touches the equipment. "Master’s tools! Do not touch!" summarizes the exclusionary, hostile nature of the Science Directorate.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 32: Kaelen's Stand](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2520-2540)
- **Defining Quote:** "Turned the key that killed him." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: LUST[For Power]/FATAL DEVOTION)
