## Chapter 31: The Goodbye

### Scene 1: The Pods

- **Key Event:** The Cryo-Deck.
- **Detailed Description:** The Cryo-Deck of the _Aeterna_—the ancient colony ship they have retrofitted—is a cavernous, refrigerated tomb. A low-lying mist of liquid nitrogen rolls across the grating of the floor, swirling around Angelica's boots. The space is silent except for the rhythmic _thrum-hiss_ of the cooling units. Rows of silver cryo-pods stretch into the darkness, illuminated by faint blue status lights. There are six hundred of them. The entire surviving population of the Hidden Valley. The last free humans on the planet.

- **Key Event:** The inspection.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica walks down the center aisle. She checks the vitals on the displays. Green lights reflect in her eyes. Heart rates slowed to 4 beats per minute. Body temperature nearing absolute zero. They are not dead, but they are gone. Suspended in time. It is a heavy sight.

- **Key Event:** The hesitation.
- **Detailed Description:** She stops at a pod near the end. It is open. Inside sits a little girl, Lisbet-7 (a descendant of the Lisbet she knew in the Zenith). The girl is clutching a ragged stuffed animal made of rabbit fur. She is trembling. Her eyes are wide with terror as she looks at the frost gathering on the interior glass.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet-7:** "Will it hurt?"

- **Key Event:** The reassurance.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica kneels. The metal is cold against her knees. She takes the girl's small hand. It is warm.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. It won't hurt. It will feel like a nap. A long nap. You'll close your eyes, and when you open them, you'll be somewhere new."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet-7:** "Will the monsters be there when I wake up? The metal men?"

- **Key Event:** The promise.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica strokes the girl's hair. She lies with total conviction.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. When you wake up, the sky will be blue again. The monsters will be dust. I promise. We are going to a place where they can't follow."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She takes the burden of the lie. She doesn't know what the future holds, but she refuses to let the child carry the fear.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet-7:** "Okay. I trust you, Sky-Woman."

- **Key Event:** The initiation.
- **Detailed Description:** The girl lies back. She hugs the rabbit. Angelica presses the sequence button. The glass slides shut with a pneumatic hiss. The frost blooms instantly, obscuring the girl's face. The vitals monitor beeps. _Status: Stasis Active._

### Scene 2: The Sleep

- **Key Event:** The closure.
- **Detailed Description:** The last heavy seal of the blast doors hisses shut, sealing the Cryo-Deck. The room is now a tomb. Angelica stands alone in the airlock.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ They are safe. They are cargo now. Six hundred lives. Six hundred futures packed in ice. She feels a crushing weight of responsibility. She is carrying a civilization in her hold. If she fails, humanity ends here.

- **Key Event:** The interruption.
- **Detailed Description:** Suddenly, the ship shudders violently. A deep, resonant _BOOM_ vibrates through the hull plates. Dust falls from the ceiling conduits. The red alert klaxons begin to wail. Ideally, they would launch quietly under the cover of the nebula. Reality has other plans.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Bridge! Status!"

### Scene 3: The Check

- **Key Event:** The Bridge.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica bursts onto the bridge. It is chaotic. Sparks are showering from a blown console. Elara is at the tactical station, her hands flying across the controls.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elara:** "Shields are holding at 80%! But we're taking heavy kinetic fire!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Who is hitting us?"

- **Key Event:** The enemy.
- **Detailed Description:** Elara throws the tactical view onto the main screen. The valley below is burning. Through the smoke, green lances of laser fire cut upwards.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elara:** "Hunters. They didn't wait for nightfall. They landed dropships at the gate. Mechs. Heavy walkers. Sector 4 is already overrun."

- **Key Event:** The timeline.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica assesses the situation. The launch window is closing.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Where is Torin? We need the main thrusters online."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elara:** "He's at the ramp. He's holding the line with the rearguard. He says the engines need three more minutes to reach launch thrust."

- **Key Event:** The cost.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica swears. Three minutes is an eternity in a firefight. Torin is buying them time with blood.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Tell him two minutes. Route all auxiliary power to the drive. Life support, gravity, I don't care. Give me thrust."

### Scene 4: The Promise

- **Key Event:** The glance back.
- **Detailed Description:** Before she straps into the pilot's chair, Angelica looks back at the door to the Cryo-Deck. She thinks of Lisbet-7 frozen in the dark. She thinks of the promise she made.

- **Key Event:** The resolve.
- **Detailed Description:** She places her hand on the bulkhead door. The metal vibrates with the impacts of the enemy fire hull.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Sleep tight. See you in the future. I promise I won't let you down."

- **Key Event:** The action.
- **Detailed Description:** She turns and runs for the turbo-lift. Her face is hard. The grief is compartmentalized. She has a war to finish before she can sleep.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Elara, charge the main cannons. If they want a fight, let's give them a goodbye present."
