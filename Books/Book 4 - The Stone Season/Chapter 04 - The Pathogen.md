  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "What is left when you remove the soul? The Lizard Brain. The basal ganglia. Hunger. Rage. Speed. It removes the hesitation of morality."

### Scene 3: The Failure

- **Key Event:** The group watches security footage of "Subject 104" transforming into a "Blighted"—a grey, black-eyed monster with inhuman strength and speed.

### Scene 4: The Warning

- **Key Event:** Aris warns that the "Blighted" are attracted to heat and are now widespread due to containment failure during the fall.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Do not aim for the head. The brain is redundant. You have to sever the spine or burn the heart. They don't feel pain. They don't feel fear. They only feel hunger."
