# Character Profile: Photographer Vorn

**Archetype:** The Propagandist / The Observer
**True Sin:** GREED (He hoards moments of "perfection" to sell to the masses, profiting from curated lies).
**Virtue Mask:** ARTISTRY (He claims his bias is just "composition").

## I. Role in the Story

Photographer Vorn is a hovering paparazzi allowed into Corinne's inner circle to document her curated life for the Zenith "Cloud." He is the primary architect of the public image that masks the rot within the court.

- **The Narrative Control:** He is responsible for the "image" Corinne broadcasts, ensuring the world sees only the porcelain doll and never the cracks.
- **The Exclusion:** He actively removes "flaws" from the frame. When Angelica steps into a shot, he lowers the camera and sighs, waving her away because she "ruins the composition." This act signals that Angelica is a blemish on the story the Zenith tells itself.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Epiphany / Artistic Betrayal. Vorn captures a raw, unedited photo of Corinne in a moment of genuine, ugly rage. Instead of deleting it, he becomes obsessed with the "truth" of the Zenith's decay and leaks the photo to the Silt networks.
- **Impact on Lady Corinne:** This is a death-blow to her public image. She becomes a laughingstock, her "perfection" revealed as a carefully constructed lie. She descends into a paranoid isolation.
- **Impact on Entourage:** Vorn is hunted by the Praetorian Guard. His betrayal shatters the court's trust in their own propaganda, forcing them to realize that the outside world is finally looking at them for what they truly are.

## III. Narrative Integration

- **Event Location:** [Book 4, Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%204_%20The%20Stone%20Season%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L635-L636)
- **Defining Quote from Lady Corinne:** "You were paid to capture the light, Vorn, not the shadows. If you want to show the world the 'truth,' remember that truth is just a matter of composition. And I’ve already composed your cell."
