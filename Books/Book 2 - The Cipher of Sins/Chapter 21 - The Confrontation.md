## Chapter 21: The Confrontation

### Scene 1: The Breach

- **Key Event:** The Setting.
- **Detailed Description:** The front parlor of "Petal & Stem" is dim, filled with the scent of lilies and old dust. Joyce has shoved a heavy oak dresser in front of the door, but the wood splinters like balsa as the door explodes inward.
- **Key Event:** The Entrance.
- **Detailed Description:** Shards of glass and wood shower the room. Through the dust, **Kaelen Night** steps over the threshold. He is a silhouette against the rainy streetlights. The shadows in the room seem to detach from the corners and walls, slithering across the floor to join him, clinging to his armor like a living cloak.
- **Key Event:** The Defense.
- **Detailed Description:** **Hatcher**, crouched behind the counter, fires his scatter-gun. _BOOM._ The sound is deafening in the small space.
- **Key Event:** The Shield.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen doesn't duck. He casually raises his left hand. The buckshot hits a wall of sudden darkness a foot from his face. The pellets hang there, suspended in zero-gravity void, spinning harmlessly, before dropping to the floor with a metallic _clatter_.

- **Detailed Description:** He brushes ash from his coat.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Amateurs."
- **Key Event:** The Counter.

- **Key Event:** The Defeat.
- **Detailed Description:** **Zephyr** lunges from the side, swinging his mechanical hook. Kaelen catches the metal arm mid-swing, twists it with sickening torque, and sends Zephyr flying over the counter to crash onto the floor.
- **Key Event:** The Dominance.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen stands alone in the center of the room. He hasn't even drawn his sword. He looks bored.

### Scene 2: The Standoff

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. I choose death. I choose freedom."
- **Key Event:** The Shock.
