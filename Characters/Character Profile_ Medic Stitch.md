# Character Profile: Medic "Stitch"

**Archetype:** The Healer / The Protector of Flesh
**True Sin:** ENVY (He hates the magic that heals Angelica while he has to use needles and thread to keep his friends alive).
**Virtue Mask:** COMPASSION (He frames his insults as "Medical Advice").

## I. Role in the Story

Medic "Stitch" is the squad medic who patches Ria up after every fight. He represents the physical toll of the "Iron Vanguard's" life and the human cost of Angelica's commands.

- **The Friction:** He scolds Angelica for "working Ria too hard," treating her strategic requests as a form of abuse.
- **The Reminder:** He reminds everyone that Ria is "flesh and blood," not a machine or "clockwork like you," which reinforces the idea that Angelica is something other than human.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Resource Scarcity / Moral Failure. **Location: Book 4, Chapter 11 (The Tri-age).** During the Silt-fever outbreak and resource shortage, Stitch refuses to treat a dying enemy civilian to save the last antibiotics for Ria's rust infection. He prioritizes the Unit over humanity.
  **Quote:** _"The Vanguard comes first. Everyone else is just biology waiting to rot."_
- **Impact on Ria:** Ria backs Stitch’s decision, causing a permanent rift between her and Angelica. Angelica realizes that Ria's loyalty is to the "Unit," not to the "People," shattering the ideal of Ria as a savior.
- **Impact on Entourage:** Stitch becomes a figure of clinical coldness. He stops treating his patients as "boys" and starts seeing them as "inventory," turning the medical bay into a place of sterile, transactional survival.

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 3 | Chapter 09 | Detailed Description | The "Rusty Gear" bar is closed for the day, its windows shuttered against the toxic smog of the Silt. Inside, the air is thick with tension and the smell of cheap coffee. Angelica sits at the main table, a holographic map of the ship projected onto the scarred wood. Opposite her sits "Doc Stitch," a disgraced Zenith surgeon who runs a back-alley clinic, and Ria, the towering enforcer who once bullied her in the Academy. Around the perimeter, her core team stands guard: **Zephyr** counts the meager operation funds in the corner; **Hatcher** leans against the doorframe, his hand near his weapon, watching the street; **Kaelen Night** sharpens his sword in the shadows, a fallen noble seeking redemption; and **Lisbet**, the tech-savant, is already wiring the prototype jammers. Angelica is no longer the scared cadet; she is the Architect. She lays out her plan with mathematical precision. She doesn't ask for loyalty; she offers a job. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 09 | Key Event | Angelica recruits Doc Stitch to build frequency jammers. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 09 | Detailed Description | Stitch is skeptical. He wipes his glasses with a rag, his hands shaking slightly from withdrawal. He argues that Vane's sensors are military-grade, impossible to jam without alerting the grid. Angelica slides a schematic across the table. It’s a design for a "Noise-Bomb"—a device that floods the local spectrum with garbage data, mimicking a solar flare. Stitch looks at the design. His eyes widen. He sees the elegance of the code. He nods, a slow smile spreading across his face. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 09 | Detailed Description | Sector 4 is the kidney of the ship—a massive, humming complex of pipes and tanks where the wastewater of the Zenith is purified and recycled. The team moves silently through the shadows. Angelica, Silas, and Ria wear black stealth suits patched together from scavenged gear. They bypass the automated sentries using Stitch's jammers. The air is humid and smells of chlorine and rot. They reach the main distribution valve—a massive wheel controlling the flow to the Upper Decks. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Detailed Description | **Medic Stitch** sets up a triage station on a workbench. Ria is pale, her breath coming in shallow rasps. The impact broke ribs and likely ruptured her spleen. She is bleeding internally. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Key Event | Stitch makes an assessment. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Detailed Description | Stitch freezes. Ironwood limps over, the servos in his new legs whining. He looks at the tactical map, then at the two patients. He doesn't hesitate. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **General Ironwood:** "Stitch. Report." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **Medic Stitch:** "One stim. Two patients. The kid is critical. Ria is critical." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **General Ironwood:** "Finality is my job, Ward. Innocence doesn't hold a rifle. We need the Vanguard. Stitch, inject her. Now." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | *Internal Conflict | Stitch hates himself, but he obeys the chain of command. He chooses utility over morality. He chooses the soldier. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **Medic Stitch:** "Sorry, kid. Orders." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Key Event | Stitch administers the stim to Ria. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Key Event | Stitch drinks. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Detailed Description | Stitch finds a bottle of industrial ethanol in his kit. He drinks it straight. He sits by the door, gun in one hand, bottle in the other, staring at the wall. He refuses to look at the mother. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | *Internal Conflict | Stitch knows he will never sleep again without the bottle. He saved the body, but he killed the soul of the group. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Moment | **Medic Stitch** — His guilt is absolute, but he knows he would make the same choice again. He is a pragmatist in hell. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 11 | Dialog | **Medic Stitch:** "Shut up. Just... survive. That's the payment. You owe that kid a life. Make it count." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 12 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "Burn the fiction. Burn the philosophy. But save the science. Burn the medical texts last. We might need the diagrams to stitch us back together." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 12 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "Burn the fiction. Burn the philosophy. But save the science. Burn the medical texts last. We might need the diagrams to stitch us back together." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 28 | Dialog | **Joyce:** (Staring at the pulsing cables) "It's a weave. Look at the patterns. Arteries knit into fiber-optics. It's not distinct; it's a tapestry. A horrible, bloody tapestry. I've never seen stitch-work like this." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 40 | *Key Dialog | **Hatcher:** "She's back. Get the medic. And someone get her some water—real water, not that recycled garbage." |
| Book 5 | Chapter 40 | Detailed Description | While Angelica drifted in the Bulk, **Ria (The Iron Vanguard)** stood guard over her catatonic body on the bridge. For the entire duration of the crisis—what felt like hours—Ria has been positioned beside the pilot's chair, plasma torch in hand, ready to fight anyone or anything that tried to touch the Captain. When Angelica wakes screaming, Ria is the first to move, cutting her restraints and shouting for a medic. Her face is haggard, but her hands are steady. She has not slept since the drive failed. |
| Book 5 | Chapter 40 | Dialog | **Ria (to a nearby ensign):** "Medic! Now! Not in ten seconds—now! She's bleeding from the ears!" |
| Book 6 | Chapter 26 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "Get a medic! And get a backup seal on that valve! We are not losing this ship! Not after this! No more mistakes!" |
| Book 6 | Chapter 28 | Dialog | **Miner:** "Chief! You're hurt! We need a medic!" |
| Book 6 | Chapter 32 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "Medic! Get a medic up here!" |
| Book 6 | Chapter 43 | Dialog | **Angelica Ward:** "Hello, Kaelen. Looking young. Try not to get shot this time. I'm fresh out of bacta-patches and I don't have the patience to stitch you up." |
| Book 7 | Chapter 13 | *Internal Conflict | Ria feels a cold rage building in her chest. She is used to being the hammer, not the nail. She hates being pinned down. She hates the feeling of helplessness. She looks at her squad—Knuckles, Stitch, Ghost. They are scared. They are looking to her for a way out. She realizes that standard tactics won't work. You can't flank a line that has no width. You have to break it. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 19 | Detailed Description | The corridor leading to the Med Bay is choked with gurneys and walking wounded. The air smells of antiseptic, burnt flesh, and fear. The blast doors are sealed, but the Peacekeepers are setting up a breaching charge. Their leader, a chipped Lieutenant named Kovic, is shouting orders, his voice flat and synthesized. He demands entry to seize the "strategic assets"—morphine, bio-foam, and surgical drones. Inside, the medical staff are terrified. Dr. Stitch is trying to continue surgery on a patient while the door vibrates from the hammering outside. The lights flicker with every impact, casting long, jumping shadows across the sterile white walls. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 19 | Moment | **Lady Corinne** — She watches them retreat down the corridor. She waits until the heavy blast doors cycle shut and lock. She listens for the sound of their boots fading away. Then, and only then, does she allow her legs to give out. She collapses into a chair, shaking uncontrollably. Her hands are trembling so hard she can't clasp them together. Dr. Stitch runs over to catch her. |
| Book 7 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Dr. Stitch:** "Corinne! Are you hit? Did they hurt you?" |
| Book 7 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Corinne:** "No. Just... acting. It was all a performance, Stitch. Just smoke and mirrors." |
| Book 7 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Dr. Stitch:** "You saved us. That wasn't a trick." |
| Book 7 | Chapter 19 | Dialog | **Corinne:** "I think I need a drink, Stitch. A very large one. And maybe a sedative. I think I'm going to have a heart attack." |
| Book 7 | Chapter 33 | Detailed Description | Lisbet arrives just as the medics use the jaws of life to crack the warped canopy. Steam hisses out. The interior is covered in ice. Zephyr is still slumped in the seat. A medic presses a sensor to his neck. Silence. Lisbet stops breathing. Then, the medic nods. "Pulse. Weak, thready, but it's there. He's in cryo-shock. Get the thermal blankets!" |
