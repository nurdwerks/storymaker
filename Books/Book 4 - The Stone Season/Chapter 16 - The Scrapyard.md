# Chapter 16: The Scrapyard

---

### Scene 1: The Sanctuary

- **Key Event:** The group retreats to Hatcher's main fortified bunker, which is hidden inside a hollowed-out mechanical recycling plant—the true "Scrapyard."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — Reveals that the Scrapyard is more than just a home; it's a "Lifeboat" for residents of the Undercity who reject both the Emperor and Vane.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "The Spire is falling. The Foundation is rotting. This is the only place left where the air doesn't taste like ozone and lies."

### Scene 2: The Repairs

- **Key Event:** Using the Scrapyard’s superior tools, Lisbet and Zephyr work together to create a functional (though crude) armor set for Ria to replace her damaged plating.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Uses his one remaining hand and his "High-Deck" engineering knowledge to calibrate the new servos.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "It’s not gold plating, Ria. It’s heavy-duty industrial shielding. You’ll look like a tank, but you’ll move like a freight train."

- **Key Event:** **Tinker** attempts to fix a high-pressure primary conduit to keep the camp warm. The pipe bursts, and he loses his remaining arm in the explosion.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Tinker:** "I fixed it, Hatcher. The pressure is... stable."

### Scene 3: The Intel

- **Key Event:** Hatcher reveals the true nature of the "Nulls"—that they are humans whose brains have been replaced by a primitive silicon-circuitry interface to make them immune to the Pathogen.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "He removed the organic risk. He replaced biology with copper. It’s not evolution; it's masonry."

- **Key Event:** **Old Man Rust** is hit by a "memory-surge" from an ancient Zenith transmitter (the "Signal"). The shock of absolute recall causes a fatal heart attack.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Old Man Rust:** "The sky... it was blue! I remember the birds!"

### Scene 4: The Preparation

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes that the Foundation is not just a destination but the origin point of the Pathogen, and the group prepares for a final, one-way descent.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Distributes the last of their clean water and rations, acknowledging that they likely won’t return from the deepest levels.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Check your seals. Check your mags. This is the last stop. From here on, there are no maps."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Then we make our own path, Captain."
