### Chapter 6: The Horde

#### Scene 1: The Swarm

The security feed flickered, the signal degrading as the power reserves dipped lower. But the image was clear enough to send a chill through the marrow of everyone in the lab. The corridor outside the blast door was filling up.

It wasn't just Vermillion anymore. The high-pitched shriek he had released—the dinner bell of the Blighted—had done its job. They were pouring out of the shadows, crawling from the vents, and dropping from the shattered ceiling panels like rotting fruit. They moved with a disturbing, insectoid fluidity, their limbs snapping and reforming as they navigated the wreckage.

There were hundreds of them. Men and women in tattered Zenith finery, laborers in grey jumpsuits, even children. All of them moved with the same jerky, twitching speed. They crawled on the walls and the ceiling, defying gravity with fingers that had elongated into claws. Their eyes were black voids, reflecting the emergency lights like oil slicks.

"Look at them," Aris whispered, his face pressed close to the screen, his fear forgotten in the face of scientific fascination. "They don't jostle. They don't fight for space. They are a fluid dynamic. The Hive Mind is rudimentary, but efficient."

"They're not people," Ria said, checking the load in her shotgun. Her hands were steady, but her knuckles were white. "They're just targets."

"They are a hive," Aris corrected. "Vermillion was the beacon. Now they are the swarm. And we are the honey."

#### Scene 2: The Speed

*BANG.*

The first impact against the door was like a cannon shot. The heavy steel plate, designed to withstand a lab explosion, dented inward. A spiderweb of cracks appeared in the concrete frame, dust raining down.

"Barricade!" Angelica yelled, snapping out of her trance.

Ria was already moving. She grabbed a heavy steel workbench, her muscles bulging under her metal skin, and hurled it against the door. It crashed into place with a deafening clang. Zephyr and Kaelen grabbed crates of equipment, piling them up, their movements frantic.

*BANG. BANG. BANG.*

The pounding was rhythmic now. A hundred fists hitting the metal at the exact same second. The door groaned, the hinges screaming in protest.

"They're stronger than they look," Ria grunted, bracing her shoulder against the barricade. "That's three inches of steel! They're hitting it like a battering ram!"

"Adrenaline overload," Aris shouted over the noise, typing furiously on his console. "They bypass the brain's safety limiters. A human can lift a car if they don't care about tearing their muscles. These things will break their own arms to get through that door. They don't feel pain. They don't stop until the structural integrity fails! They will pulverize their own bones to get to us!"

As if to prove his point, a hand punched *through* the metal. It was a bloody, mangled ruin of a hand, fingers stripped to the bone, but it clawed blindly at the air, black blood spraying. It grasped for Ria, its nails scraping against her metal skin.

#### Scene 3: The Run

"We can't hold this," Kaelen said, his voice calm but his eyes wide. He drew his sword, the metal humming. "There are too many. If they breach, we're dead."

"Agreed," Aris said, grabbing a datapad. "Retreat is the only logical option."

He slammed his hand onto a red button on his desk. A hidden hatch in the floor hissed open, revealing a dark, rusty ladder descending into the bowels of the station.

"Maintenance tunnels," Aris explained. "They run parallel to the main shafts. Narrow. Defensible. They lead to the lower heating grid."

"Go!" Angelica ordered. "Lisbet, you first. Aris, get your data. We're leaving."

"Already downloaded," Aris said, tapping his temple. "Nautilus is the backup. Let's move."

They scrambled down the ladder. The noise above them was deafening now—the sound of metal tearing and hundreds of voices screaming in a hunger-frenzy. It sounded like the world was being eaten.

Angelica grabbed Zephyr by his collar. He was staring at the door, paralyzed. "Move, thief! Or you don't get paid!"

He stumbled after her, his face pale. Kaelen was the last one out. He stood at the top of the hatch, looking at the door as it finally buckled. The barricade collapsed. A wave of grey bodies poured into the room like water.

Kaelen raised his hand. He didn't use his sword. He used his blood. He bit his thumb, a quick, practiced motion, and flicked a drop of crimson into the air.

"**Umbra**," he whispered.

Shadows erupted from the corners of the room, solidifying into a wall of black spikes. It wouldn't stop them, but it would slow them down. He dropped down the hatch and sealed it just as the first Blighted threw itself at his face, its teeth snapping on empty air.

#### Scene 4: The Fall

They slid down a disposal chute, tumbling in the dark, hitting pipes and grates. It was a rough, bruising descent. They landed in a heap on a pile of refuse in a damp, echoing tunnel. The air smelled of mold and old oil.

Aris was the first up. He spun the wheel of the hatch, locking it tight. "That seal won't hold forever. We have maybe twenty minutes before they chew through the floor."

From the other side of the thick metal, the scratching started immediately. It was the sound of a thousand rats in the walls.

"What do they want?" Angelica asked, wiping slime from her face. She looked up at the hatch, shivering. "Why are they so... aggressive? It's not just hunger. It feels like hate."

"Hunger is hate," Aris said, adjusting his glasses. "The virus accelerates metabolism. They are starving to death every second of every day. If they stop eating, they die. They are in constant, agonizing pain."

He looked at the group, his red eyes gleaming in the dark.

"They don't want your brain, Miss Vance. They don't want your politics. They don't care about your titles. They want your calories. To them, we are just walking energy bars. We are the only meal on the menu."

### Chapter 7: Corinne's Fall

#### Scene 1: The Trap

The maintenance tunnels were a labyrinth of steam pipes, dripping water, and darkness. It was a place designed for machines, not people. In the chaos of the retreat, the group had been forced to scatter, pushed apart by falling debris and panicked sprints. The tunnels branched off in a thousand directions, a maze of rusted steel that smelled of neglect and decay.

**Lady Corinne** was alone.

She had taken a wrong turn at a junction, following a flickering light that she thought was the exit. Instead, it was a sparking fuse box, spitting blue fire into the gloom. Now, she was lost in a corridor that looked exactly like the last ten she had run through. The walls were weeping condensation, and the floor was slick with oil.

She leaned against a rusted pipe, panting, her breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps. Her dress, a masterpiece of Zenith couture made of spun starlight-silk, was torn at the hem. Mud stained the pristine white fabric, turning it grey. Her shoes—anti-grav heels designed for floating across marble floors—were dead weight. One of the repulsors had failed, making her limp with every step.

She checked her reflection in a puddle of oily water. Her makeup was smeared. A streak of dirt marred her cheek. Her hair, usually a perfect halo of light, was matted with sweat and grime. She looked like a broken doll.

"Unacceptable," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Absolutely unacceptable."

She reached into her purse for a compact, but her hand shook so badly she dropped it. It skittered across the metal floor, spinning like a top.

*Clatter.*

The sound echoed in the silence, amplified by the acoustics of the pipes. It was a bell ringing in a tomb. And then, it was answered.

*Hiss.*

#### Scene 2: The Command

A shadow detached itself from the ceiling pipes. It dropped to the floor with a wet thud, landing in a crouch.

It was a Blighted. This one had been a servant, still wearing the shredded remains of a grey uniform. Its face was a mask of black veins and hungry eyes. It crouched low, like a toad, muscles bunching for a spring. It dripped black ichor onto the floor.

Corinne straightened her spine. She ignored the mud, the cold, and the fear. She summoned the only weapon she had ever needed: her status. She had been trained since birth to command. She was a Lady of the Zenith, a descendant of House Silver, and she would not die in a sewer.

She raised her chin, channeling her **Voice Toll**. She projected authority, the kind that made grown men kneel in the court. It was a magic born of centuries of breeding.

"I am Lady Corinne of the High Court!" she announced, her voice booming with supernatural resonance. "I command you to stand down! Heel, you mongrel! Heel!"

The Blighted paused. It tilted its head. For a second, Corinne thought it worked. The social conditioning of the Zenith was deep. Even in death, the servant recognized the tone of a Master. The creature's muscles relaxed slightly. It blinked its black eyes.

Then, the creature screamed. It wasn't a scream of obedience. It was a scream of excitement. It didn't care about rank. It didn't care about the crest on her dress. It just saw meat that was making a noise. It saw food that was playing with it. The virus had rewritten the social contract. There were no masters here, only prey.

#### Scene 3: The Attack

It lunged.

Corinne shrieked, a sound of pure terror. She tried to summon **Spectra**, her light-construct. She threw her hands up, willing a flash-bang to blind the beast. She visualized the burning white light of a star.

*Fzzzt.*

A weak spark fizzled at her fingertips and died. She was exhausted. The stress of the fall and the cold had drained her caloric reserves. Her magic was gone. She was just a girl in a dress, facing a monster.

The Blighted hit her, knocking her back into the pipes. Its claws tore through her silk dress, raking her arm. Pain, sharp and hot, flared. The smell of her own blood filled the air. It was a metallic, sweet scent that drove the creature into a frenzy.

She fell, scrambling backward in the muck. Her hand closed around something cold and hard. A piece of rebar, rusted and jagged, broken off from the wall.

The monster was on top of her. Its jaw unhinged, revealing rows of translucent, needle-like teeth. Its breath smelled of copper and rot. It was going to eat her face.

#### Scene 4: The Kill

Corinne didn't think. She didn't plan. The "Silly Girl" mask dissolved, revealing the desperate animal underneath. The instinct to live, which she had buried under layers of etiquette and false helplessness, surged to the surface.

She thrust the rebar upward.

It wasn't a graceful strike. It wasn't a fencing move she had learned at the Academy. It was a panic-stab. But it went true. The jagged metal punched through the creature's eye socket and into the brain. There was a sickening crunch of bone.

The Blighted convulsed. It thrashed, its claws scratching at the floor, black blood spurting onto Corinne's face. It screeched, a dying, gurgling sound. Then, it went still, a heavy, dead weight on top of her.

Corinne lay there for a moment, gasping, staring up at the dark ceiling. She pushed the corpse off her, her arms shaking. She kicked it away, revulsion warring with relief.

She looked at her hands. They were covered in black slime. Her dress was ruined. She was alive.

She stood up, wiping her hands on her skirt. It was a futile gesture; the stain was permanent. The black blood had soaked into the silk, turning the white fabric into a map of her survival.

"The monsters don't check ID," she whispered to the silence.

She gripped the rebar tighter. It wasn't a fan. It wasn't a glass of wine. It was ugly. But it worked. She started walking into the dark, leaving the Lady behind. She was a killer now. And she was going to survive. She would make them all pay for ruining her dress.

### Chapter 8: The Hunger

#### Scene 1: The Rationing

Three days.

That was how long they had been trapped in the Boiler Room. It was a small, defensible space deep in the maintenance sector, warm thanks to the geothermal pipes running through the walls. But it was a prison. The air was thick with the smell of unwashed bodies and fear.

Outside, the scratching never stopped. The Horde was waiting. They could hear them sniffing at the cracks in the door, their claws testing the metal. Occasionally, a thud would shake the walls as a Blighted threw itself against the barrier, testing the hinges. The sound was a constant reminder of their mortality.

Inside, the enemy was quieter, but just as deadly.

They were out of food. The few nutrient bars they had scavenged were gone. Zephyr had licked the last wrapper clean yesterday, his stomach growling loudly in the silence. The hunger was a constant, gnawing presence. It made them sharp, irritable, and weak. It wasn't just a physical emptiness; it was a psychological weight, pulling them down.

Dr. Aris sat in the corner, guarding a small, silver case. Inside were six tubes of high-density military nutrient paste. He had found them in the Science Module and hidden them in his coat. He had been saving them for a "critical caloric deficit."

Ria watched him. Her eyes were sunken, her metal skin looking dull and grey without the oil and calories needed to maintain it. She looked like a rusted machine, her movements jerky and stiff. She could feel her joints locking up, the metal grinding against bone.

"Share," she said. It wasn't a request. It was a threat. She stood up, her shadow looming over him. Her hands, heavy and hard, clenched into fists.

#### Scene 2: The Division

Aris looked up. He calculated the variables. If he refused, Ria would kill him and take it all. She was desperate enough. Her logic centers were being overridden by survival instincts. If he shared, they all starved slower. But he needed his brain to function. He needed the glucose to keep Nautilus online.

"Fine," he said, sighing. "Rationing protocols initiate."

He opened the case. The smell of the paste—chemical, bland, and wonderful—filled the room. He squeezed a dollop of grey paste onto a piece of plastic for everyone. It wasn't enough. It was barely a mouthful. It smelled like chalk and chemicals.

But for himself and Ria, he squeezed a double portion.

"Hey!" Lisbet cried, her voice thin and cracking. She was curled up in a ball, hugging her knees. She looked smaller than usual, her oversized coat swallowing her whole. Her neon hair was dull, matted with grease. "That's not fair! You can't just take more!"

"Fair is a Zenith concept," Ria snapped, shoveling the paste into her mouth without tasting it. She swallowed it whole. "I do the fighting. I burn the most energy. If I starve, I lock up. If I lock up, the door opens, and we all get eaten. It's logic. Caloric distribution based on utility."

Lisbet looked at her tiny portion, tears welling in her eyes. She was small, and she was hungry in a way that hurt. She felt abandoned. The logic was sound, but it was cruel. It confirmed what she feared: she was the expendable one. She was just a glitch in the system.

#### Scene 3: The Weakness

Kaelen looked at his share. It was a tiny blob of grey sludge. He could feel his anemia pulling at him, a constant dizziness that made the room spin. He needed the iron. He needed the protein. His hands were shaking so bad he could barely hold the plastic. His vision was tunneling, grey spots dancing at the edges.

He looked at Angelica.

She was sitting by the door, listening to the scratching. She was shivering violently. Her heat regulation was failing. She looked frail, her skin almost transparent. The golden glow of her veins was dim, like a dying ember. She hadn't complained once. She was holding it together by sheer will, trying to be the leader they needed.

Kaelen didn't say a word. He made a decision that defied his upbringing, defied the selfishness of the Zenith. He slid his piece of plastic across the floor to her.

Angelica looked at it, then at him. Her eyes widened. "No. You need it. The blood bond... you're dying. I can see your aura fading. You're grey, Kaelen."

"I'm not hungry," Kaelen lied. His stomach growled loudly, betraying him. He ignored it. "My metabolism is slower. House Night training. We learn to fast. You're the Captain. You need to think. Eat it. That's an order."

#### Scene 4: The Reality

Angelica stared at the paste. Her body screamed for it. Her mouth watered. Every instinct told her to take it, to shovel it into her mouth and lick the plastic clean.

She wanted to be noble. She wanted to push it back. But the hunger was a physical pain, a claw in her gut twisting and turning.

She ate it. She ate it fast, licking the plastic. The taste was vile, but it felt like life. It felt like warmth spreading through her chest, waking up her frozen limbs.

She watched Kaelen turn away, his face pale, his hands trembling as he cleaned his sword. He was fading. And he was doing it for her. He was literally giving her his life force.

"Love isn't a poem," Angelica thought, feeling the small burst of energy from the food. "It isn't a sonnet or a dance at a ball. Love is giving someone your last protein bar. It's stupid. It's suicidal. But it's love."

She stood up, feeling a new weight on her shoulders. She owed him. She owed them all. She couldn't let them die in this hole.

"We're getting out of here," she announced, her voice stronger than it had been in days. "Tonight. We're not dying in a hole. We're fighting our way out. Ria, get the door. Zephyr, check the vents. We move in five."

### Chapter 9: Vane's Feast

#### Scene 1: The Shadow

Deep in the wreckage of the Spire, miles above where the survivors huddled, a monster was being born. The darkness here was absolute, a crushing weight that smothered sound and light. It was a place where hope went to die, buried under tons of twisted steel and shattered glass. The air was thick with the dust of a fallen civilization, clogging the lungs with the taste of history.

**Prelate Vane** had survived the fall. It was a miracle of engineering, not luck. He had cocooned himself in a swarm-shell, a hard carapace of nanites that absorbed the impact. But the shell had shattered, leaving him exposed.

He lay in the twisted remains of his laboratory, pinned under a steel beam that had sheared off the ceiling. His left leg was crushed, a mass of pulped flesh and shattered bone. He was alone in the dark. The silence was absolute, save for the dripping of coolant from a ruptured line and his own ragged breathing.

He was starving. Not the hunger of an empty stomach, but the hunger of a hollow soul. His reserves were gone. His magic was fading. The cold was seeping into his marrow, turning his blood to sludge. He could feel his heart slowing down, conserving energy. He was dying, and he found the inefficiency of it offensive. It was a waste of a superior intellect.

#### Scene 2: The Sacrifice

The sound of buzzing filled the small pocket of space. His **Legion**—the nano-swarm that lived in his blood—was agitated. They were hungry too. They needed organic matter to replicate, to repair his suit, to keep him alive. They were a hive mind, and the hive was starving. They crawled over his skin, a million tiny legs scratching for purchase.

"Patience, my children," Vane whispered, his voice dry as dust. He licked his cracked lips. "The meal is coming."

He scanned the area with his multi-spectral eyes. There were no rats. No bodies within reach. Just metal and glass and the endless dark. He was trapped in a coffin of his own making.

The swarm buzzed louder. They were starting to feed on *him*, nipping at his healthy cells. He felt the sting of a thousand tiny bites, a warning that his control was slipping. They would consume him from the inside out if he didn't find fuel. They didn't care about the host, only the biomass. They were loyal only to the algorithm of survival.

#### Scene 3: The Feeding

Vane looked at his crushed leg. It was dead weight. Necrotic. It was poisoning him. The gangrene would kill him before the hunger did. It was a variable that needed to be removed. It was a failure of biology.

"Useless tissue," he murmured. "Inefficient. Why carry dead weight when I can convert it?"

He made a decision that would have broken a lesser mind. He commanded the Legion.

*Eat.*

The swarm descended. A black cloud covered his trapped leg. They didn't heal it. They devoured it.

Vane watched with clinical detachment as a billion tiny machines stripped the flesh from his bone. He felt the pain—white-hot and blinding, a scream that tore through his nervous system—but he categorized it as data. He screamed, but it was a silent scream, trapped in his throat. He watched them convert his own meat into energy, feeding it back into his system. The rush of power was intoxicating. It tasted like survival. It tasted like victory. He felt the energy surge through his veins, replacing the cold with a burning fire. He was eating himself to live. It was the ultimate act of recycling. It was the ultimate act of self-love. It was the communion of the damned.

He watched as his own blood was broken down into its elemental components—iron, carbon, water. The nanites spun the raw materials into new forms, weaving fibers of polymer and steel. It was a gruesome, beautiful alchemy. The smell of his own flesh being processed filled the small space, a copper tang that made his mouth water.

#### Scene 4: The Logic

Minutes later, the beam fell to the floor with a clang. Vane pulled himself free.

Where his leg had been, there was now a construct. The swarm had used the iron from his blood and the carbon from his flesh to build a prosthetic limb of pure black nanites. It hummed with power. It was stronger than the original. It was perfect. It was evolution in real-time.

He stood up. He tested the weight. The new leg moved with a fluid grace that flesh could never match. It didn't feel pain. It didn't feel cold. It was a weapon.

He laughed, a dry, rattling sound in the dark that echoed off the ruined walls. The sound was devoid of mirth, a mechanical acknowledgment of success.

"I am my own livestock," Vane said, admiring the new limb. "The cycle is efficient. Why hunt when you can harvest yourself? Flesh is just raw material. I have transcended the need for external sustenance."

He began to climb, hunting for the survivors. He was lighter now. And he was very, very hungry. He needed more fuel. He needed more data. And he knew exactly where to find it. He could smell Angelica's blood, miles below. It called to him like a siren song. He would eat them all, and he would become a god. He would turn the world into a feast, and he would be the only guest. He would consume the future to feed his present. He was the apex predator of the apocalypse, and dinner was served. He pulled himself up through the twisted metal, his new leg gripping the steel like a claw. The hunt had begun, and he was the only one who knew the rules. He was the architect of his own salvation, and the destroyer of theirs. He would remake the world in his image, one bite at a time. The universe was hostile, but so was he.

### Chapter 10: The Drifter

#### Scene 1: The Ambush

The group moved through the steam tunnels, seeking a path to the lower levels where the geothermal vents might offer more heat. The air was thick with humidity, making it hard to breathe. The walls were slick with algae and condensation, dripping a steady rhythm that sounded like a countdown.

They were tired. They were sloppy. They stumbled over pipes and splashed through puddles, making too much noise. Their discipline had eroded with their calorie count. Every step was a battle against exhaustion, against the urge to just lie down and sleep.

They walked right into a nest.

It was a boiler room, warm and humid. And it was carpeted in them. Dozens of Blighted lay in heaps, sleeping in the warmth. They looked like piles of rags until they started to move. The smell was overpowering—rotting meat and sulfur, the scent of a charnel house.

Angelica stepped on a loose grate. *Clang.*

Every head snapped up at once. Fifty pairs of black void-eyes opened. They glowed with a malevolent hunger. The silence broke as fifty throats hissed in unison.

"Run!" Angelica screamed, turning back the way they came.

They tried to retreat, but the door behind them slammed shut—rusted gears failing at the worst moment. They were trapped. The trap had sprung, and they were the rats.

"I'm out of ammo," Ria shouted, clicking her empty shotgun. She reversed it, holding it like a club. "Get behind me! I'll break their skulls!" She stood like a titan of rust, defiant to the end.

"My arm is dead," Zephyr yelled, frantically tapping his wrist. "No charge! I can't pay the toll! I'm useless!" He looked terrified, the bravado stripped away. He was just a man with a heavy, dead piece of metal attached to his shoulder, a golden anchor dragging him down.

The Blighted surged forward, a wave of teeth and claws. They scrambled over each other, a tsunami of hunger. They didn't make a sound, just a collective hiss of anticipation. They were fast, unnatural, and endless.

#### Scene 2: The Shot

They braced for death. Kaelen raised his sword, his hand trembling. Angelica pulled her knife. It felt small and pathetic against the horde. This was it. The end of the line. They were going to die in a basement, eaten by monsters.

*ZAP.*

A beam of blue plasma cut through the dark. It was blindingly bright, hotter than the sun. It hit the lead Blighted in the chest, vaporizing it instantly. The smell of ozone and burnt meat filled the air, replacing the stench of rot.

*ZAP. ZAP.*

Two more shots. Precise. Rhythmic. Two more monsters fell, holes punched through their chests, cauterized instantly. The shots were coming from above, from the darkness of the catwalks.

The Blighted hesitated, confused by the light. They hissed, shielding their eyes, their momentum broken.

#### Scene 3: The Savior

A figure stepped out from the steam pipes on the catwalk above. He moved with a heavy, deliberate grace.

He looked like a ghost from another era. He wore a tattered trench coat that had once been beige but was now stained the color of the Undercity. A wide-brimmed fedora shadowed his face. He held a custom plasma-rifle with the ease of a man who had been holding a gun since he was born. The weapon hummed with power, the only clean thing on him.

It was **Hatcher**. The Drifter. The legend of the Undercity. The man who had walked away from the Zenith and survived the fall.

He looked sixty, with a face like a dried riverbed, lined with deep crevices of grief and hard living. But he moved with the fluid grace of a man half his age. His eyes were hard, flinty, seeing everything and feeling nothing. He chewed on an unlit matchstick, rolling it from one side of his mouth to the other.

"Clear the lane!" he barked, his voice gravel and smoke. It was a command, not a request.

He pulled a pin on a grenade and dropped it over the railing. It wasn't explosive. It was a **Cryo-Grenade**.

It detonated with a *woosh*, flash-freezing the floor. The Blighted slipped, crashing into each other, their limbs freezing and snapping like dry twigs. They howled in confusion as the ice encased them, turning the floor into a skating rink of death.

#### Scene 4: The Greeting

Hatcher slid down a ladder, landing between the group and the monsters. He fired three more shots, finishing off the ones that were still moving. He moved with brutal efficiency, wasting no movement. He was a machine of war, precise and deadly.

He spat on the frozen ground. He reached into his coat and pulled out a dented flask engraved with initials that were worn smooth.

"You kids are loud," he grumbled, taking a swig. The smell of cheap algae-whisky wafted from him. "I heard you three sectors away. You sound like a herd of elephants in a library."

Angelica stared at him, her heart still racing. "Who are you?"

Hatcher wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Someone who was enjoying the quiet until you showed up."

He reloaded his rifle, the mechanism clicking smoothly. He looked at the frozen carnage, then at the terrified group. He shook his head, his expression one of weary resignation.

"I was hoping to die alone," Hatcher said, sighing the sigh of a man who has seen too much. "You ruined my retirement. Now I have to babysit."

He jerked his head towards a hidden door behind a pile of pipes. "Move. Before they thaw out. And try to be quiet this time. I'm out of grenades, and I don't work for free. My hourly rate is silence, and you're already in debt." The group scrambled after him, leaving the frozen monsters behind in the dark. Hatcher took one last look at the frozen nest, tipped his hat, and followed them into the shadows. He was back in the game, whether he liked it or not. The Drifter had a job to do, and he never left a job unfinished. He was the shepherd of the lost, and his flock was growing. He checked his ammo counter. Not enough. It was never enough. But it would have to do. The Stone Season had begun, and he was the only one who knew how to survive the winter.
