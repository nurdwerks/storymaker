# Chapter 17: The Gear-Grinder

The wreckage of Squad Gold’s train lay twisted on the tracks a mile back, a smoking monument to entropy. Black smoke curled into the grey sky, marking the spot where Kaelen had derailed their arrogance with a single, well-placed singularity.

Angelica paused, looking back through the smog.

"They survived," Kaelen said, not stopping his march. "Do not assume otherwise. Vane has kinetic shielding of her own, and Aris has medical stims that can restart a stopped heart. We bought time. Nothing more."

"Time is a variable," Angelica muttered, adjusting the strap of her pack. "And we just spent a lot of it."

"We spent energy," Kaelen corrected. "We gained distance."

They were moving through the "Rust Belt," a transitional zone between the residential sectors and the industrial core of the Arena. It was a graveyard of old machines—hulks of rusted cranes, piles of discarded gears larger than houses, and silence that felt heavy.

Ria walked point, her massive frame sweeping left and right. She was still buzzing from the fight, her fists clenching and unclenching.

"I still think we should have finished them," she grumbled. "We had them pinned. I could have ripped that train open like a sardine can."

"And engaged a fortified position with zero cover while a sniper watched from the high ground?" Kaelen’s tone was clipped. "That is not strategy, Ria. That is suicide."

"It's fun," Ria countered.

"Fun is inefficient."

Angelica ignored them. She was scanning the debris field. Her eyes, trained in the Silt, didn't see junk. She saw components.

A rusted pipe? _Leverage bar._
A coil of copper wire? _Conductor._
A shattered glass pane? _Cutting tool._

"Hold," she said, raising a hand.

Ria stopped, looking back. "What is it, Runt? Your feet hurt?"

"No," Angelica pointed to a pile of scrap metal ten yards to their left. It looked random to the untrained eye. But to her, the pattern was wrong. The rust didn't match. "That pile. It's artificial."

"Everything here is artificial," Ria said.

"I mean it was placed," Angelica walked toward it, careful where she stepped. "The oxidation on these beams is fresh. Someone moved them recently."

She knelt by the pile. Underneath a sheet of corrugated iron, she saw the corner of a crate. It was Gunmetal Grey—standard issue, but high-grade.

"Supply cache," she whispered.

Ria’s eyes lit up. "Food? Water? Ammo?" She stepped forward, reaching for the iron sheet.

"Don't!" Angelica barked.

Ria froze, her hand inches from the metal. "Why?"

"Look at the ground," Angelica pointed. "The dust is disturbed in a radial pattern around the crate. It's a pressure trap. You lift that sheet, you trigger the release."

Ria pulled her hand back slowly. "Explosives?"

"Worse," Angelica traced a wire that was barely visible in the dirt. "Plasma disperser. It would vaporize anyone standing within five feet."

Kaelen moved up beside her. He looked at the wire. He looked at Angelica. "Can you disarm it?"

"It's a standard Imperial percussion trigger," Angelica said, her fingers already moving. She pulled her multi-tool from her belt. "Simple mechanism. But delicate. If my hand shakes... boom."

"Then do not shake," Kaelen said.

Angelica took a breath. She focused. The world narrowed down to the wire and the firing pin. This was her element. Not combat. Not politics. Mechanics. Cause and effect.

She clamped the wire. She inserted a probe into the pin housing.

_Click._

The tension released.

"Clear," she let out a breath she realized she'd been holding.

Ria kicked the iron sheet away. The crate was revealed. She ripped the lid off.

"Jackpot," Ria grinned.

Inside were ration bars, three canisters of purified water, and—most importantly—a Kinetic Battery.

"That's for me," Ria grabbed the battery. It was a heavy, glowing blue cylinder. She slotted it into the port on her armor. The servos hummed with renewed power. "At 40% efficiency. Now I'm at 90%."

Angelica grabbed a water canister. She took a long drink. The water was cool, metallic, but it was life. She passed it to Kaelen.

He took a sip, his eyes never leaving the horizon. "Good eyes, Mechanic. Most cadets would have walked right into that."

"Most cadets didn't grow up taking apart landmines for copper," Angelica said, pocketing a spare coil of wire from the trap mechanism. "Waste nothing."

"Indeed," Kaelen handed the water back. "We move. The Foundry is ahead."

They continued, the landscape changing as they approached Sector 9.

The twisted metal of the Rust Belt gave way to organized industry. The air grew hotter. The silence was replaced by a low, rhythmic thrumming that vibrated in the soles of their boots.

To reach the supply line Angelica had identified—Line 4, the water transport—they had to cross Sector 9.

The Foundry.

If the Outer Ring was the skin of the city, the Foundry was its guts. It was an industrial nightmare of moving parts, a cathedral of friction where the air itself seemed to vibrate with malice.

They stepped through a massive archway shaped like a gear tooth, and the temperature spiked immediately. It wasn't just warm; it was oppressive. The heat radiated from the floor, from the walls, from the open vents that plummeted down into the planet's geothermal core. It pressed against their skin like a physical weight, tasting of copper, carbon, and burnt oil.

"Hot," Ria grunted, wiping sweat from her forehead. Her grey jumpsuit was already dark with perspiration. "It smells like a dragon's armpit in here."

"Geothermal venting," Kaelen noted, his voice calm but his eyes scanning the shadows. "This sector powers the hydraulic systems for the entire city. Keep moving. The heat signature will mask us from sensors, but it will also mask any threats."

They moved onto a narrow suspension bridge that spanned a vast chasm of machinery.

Below them, eighty feet down, the darkness was punctuated by the orange glow of molten slag moving in open channels. Colossal pistons, the size of redwood trees, rose and fall in a rhythmic, deafening cadence. _KA-THOOM. KA-THOOM._ The sound rattled Angelica’s teeth.

"Don't look down," she whispered to herself.

"I heard that," Ria said over her shoulder. "Looking down is how you don't fall."

"Looking down is how you get vertigo," Angelica corrected. "Focus on the path. Vector forward."

The bridge was fifty meters long, a mesh walkway suspended by thick steel cables. It swayed slightly with the vibration of the pistons below. In the center, giant cogs—some fifty feet in diameter—rotated slowly, their teeth passing dangerously close to the handrails.

They were halfway across when the sound changed.

It wasn't a grind or a hiss. It was a mechanical groan, deeper than the ambient noise. It sounded like metal under torture.

Angelica stopped. She felt a vibration in her boots that didn't match the pistons.

"Stop," she said.

Kaelen froze instantly. Ria took one more step before halting.

"What?" Ria asked.

"Seismic vibration increasing," Angelica checked her datapad. The screen flickered, interfering with the magnetic field of the room. "But it's not random. It's... rhythmic. It's mechanical actuation."

_SNAP._

The sound was like a whip crack.

The suspension cables on the right side of the bridge went slack.

There was no time to run. There was no time to scream.

The entire metal platform, fifty meters of steel and mesh, tilted violently. It didn't fall; it rotated. It swung on a central axis, dropping the right side until the floor was angled at a steep forty-five degrees.

The change in orientation turned the walkway into a slide.

The friction-tape on the floor was worn smooth by decades of industrial grit. It offered no grip.

"Ria!" Angelica shouted as her feet went out from under her.

"Gotcha!" Ria lunged, but she was sliding too.

They were sliding sideways, down the slope of the mesh, directly toward the edge.

And past the edge, twenty feet away, was a massive furnace vent—a circular maw spewing white-hot exhaust gases.

"Boots!" Kaelen barked. "Mag-lock!"

Ria and Kaelen slammed their heels down.

_THUD._

The magnetic locks in their standard-issue boots clamped onto the metal mesh. They jerked to a halt, their bodies dangling at the precarious angle.

Angelica slammed her heels down. _Click._

Nothing happened.

"My coils!" she screamed, sliding past Kaelen. "They're fried!"

Kaelen reached out, his hand grasping for her, but she was out of range.

She was sliding fast now. The edge of the walkway was ten feet away. The furnace vent roared below, a hungry mouth of fire.

"Angelica!" Ria shouted.

Angelica scrambled, her fingernails tearing against the mesh. Useless.

She saw a shape protrude from the wall of the walkway—a service junction box. It was small, rusted, and bolted to the frame.

It was her only variable.

She flung her body sideways, kicking off a rivet head.

_WHAM._

She collided with the box hard. The impact knocked the wind out of her lungs, bruising her ribs, but she didn't let go. She jammed her left arm behind the box, hooking her elbow around the conduit pipes.

She shuddered to a halt.

She hung there, gasping, her legs dangling over the abyss. The heat from the furnace vent below blasted her boots, singing the rubber soles.

"Status!" Kaelen yelled. He was holding on, but the strain on his mag-boots was visible. The induction coils were whining—a high-pitched scream of protest.

"Holding!" Angelica wheezed. "But the layout... it's a trap. It's not a malfunction. It's a dump mechanism."

"Can you reset it?" Kaelen asked. His boot slipped an inch. Sparks flew. "My magnets are overheating. The ambient temperature is demagnetizing the coils. We have... maybe thirty seconds before we slide."

Angelica looked at the junction box she was clinging to. It wasn't just a support; it was a control unit.

She pulled herself up, wincing as her bruised ribs protested. She pried the cover off with her fingernails.

Inside was a complex array of brass gears and a spinning governor. A camshaft was rotating rapidly, driving the tilt mechanism.

"I see it!" she yelled. "It's a camshaft cycle!"

She reached for her multi-tool, but her pocket was empty. It had fallen out during the slide.

"Knife!" she shouted. "I need a lever!"

Up on the bridge, Kaelen didn't hesitate. He drew his combat knife and threw it.

It wasn't a weapon throw; it was a precision pass. The hilt struck Angelica's chest. She grabbed it.

She jammed the blade into the gears.

_SCREEEECH._

Sparks showered her face. The governor shrieked. The knife vibrated violently in her hand, the steel groaning. The tilting stopped for a second... then resumed.

The torque was too high. The knife began to bend.

"It's not stopping!" she screamed over the noise. "The torque is immense! It's going to snap!"

"Fix it!" Kaelen's voice was tight. He slipped another foot. Ria was digging her fingers into the mesh, her boots smoking.

"I can't!" Angelica realized the variable instantly. "It's a ten-ton hydraulic system. I can't fight the physics!"

The knife groaned.

But something else clicked.

From the maintenance hatches along the walls, red lights flickered on. The vibration in the wall Angelica was hugging changed pitch. It wasn't just the hum of the machine anymore. It was the skittering of legs.

"Obstruction detected," a synthesized voice boomed from the walls. "Initiating purge protocol."

"Purge?" Ria yelled, still dangling by one hand. "Does that mean what I think it means?"

"It means we are trash," Kaelen said, his voice tight. "And the janitors have arrived."

Three maintenance hatches popped open.

Out crawled the horrors of the Foundry. They were Arachnid-class maintenance drones—steel spiders the size of dogs, equipped with welding torches and buzz saws for cutting apart debris.

One crawled onto the junction box right above Angelica’s head. Its multi-faceted sensor eyes glowed a hostile crimson. It chittered, mandibles clicking together like scissors.

"Get away!" Angelica screamed, swinging her free leg up to kick at it.

Her boot connected with its faceplate. _CLANG._

The spider hissed. It reared back, a small welding torch extending from its thorax. A jet of blue flame shot out, missing Angelica’s face by inches. The heat singed her eyelashes.

"Kaelen!" she shrieked. "I'm a little busy here!"

"Suppressing," Kaelen grunted.

He couldn't let go of the rail, or he would fall. But he could aim.

He raised his free hand. A bolt of void-energy, blacker than the smoke, shot from his palm. It hit the spider squarely in the chest.

The machine didn't explode. It _imploded_. The metal chassis crumpled inward as if crushed by a giant invisible fist. The spider shrieked and fell from the wall, tumbling down into the abyss.

But two more were crawling toward Ria.

"I hate bugs!" Ria roared.

She didn't have a free hand to punch. So she used her legs.

As the first spider leaped at her, aiming for her exposed neck, she scissored her legs around its midsection.

"Crunch time!"

She squeezed. Her servo-assisted muscles bulged.

_CRUNCH._

The spider burst in a shower of sparks and hydraulic fluid. She unclamped her legs, letting the wreckage fall.

"One down!" she yelled. "Who's next?"

The third spider hesitated. It looked at Ria. It looked at the drop. It seemed to calculate the odds.

Then, it turned and scuttled toward the bridge supports. It wasn't attacking them. It was attacking the cables.

"It's cutting the line!" Angelica realized. "If it cuts the main cable, the whole bridge drops!"

"I cannot reach it!" Kaelen shouted. "Range is too extreme!"

"I can reach it!" Angelica looked at the knife still jammed in the gears. It was bending. It was about to snap.

"If I move, the governor spins!" she yelled.

"The bridge is going to fall anyway if that thing cuts the cable!" Kaelen countered. "Prioritize!"

_Choices,_ Angelica thought. _Variables._

If she let go of the knife mechanism, the tilt would increase to vertical immediately. They would fall.
If she didn't stop the spider, the bridge would collapse. They would fall.

"Physics," she muttered. "I need a projectile."

She looked at the junction box cover she had pried loose. It was heavy iron.

She grabbed it.

"Hey! Ugly!" she screamed at the spider.

The machine paused, its welding torch hovering over the steel cable.

Angelica didn't throw it like a ball. She spun it like a discus.

"Variable: Angular momentum."

She released it.

The heavy iron plate sailed through the smoky air. It wasn't a perfect shot, but it was heavy.

_CLANG._

It struck the spider on the side, knocking it off the cable. The machine flailed, its magnetic feet scrambling for purchase that wasn't there. It tumbled into the darkness.

"Nice shot!" Ria cheered.

Then, the knife snapped.

_PING._

The blade shattered. The governor spun up again. The walkway groaned, tilting further. Fifty degrees. Fifty-five.

"We're going to fall," Ria yelled. "Boss, do something void-y!"

"Gravity cannot lift a bridge this size!" Kaelen snapped.

Angelica looked down.

Through the heat haze and the smoke, her eyes—enhanced by her mechanic's focus—scanned the darkness below. It was a chaotic mess of death. The furnace vent. The grinding gears. The slag channels.

But there was a rhythm.

She saw it.

Eighty feet down, moving transversely to their position, was a conveyor belt. It was transporting raw ore—massive chunks of rock. It was moving fast. Forty miles per hour.

The gap between the furnace vent and the belt was narrow. Maybe ten feet.

If they fell straight down, the furnace would incinerate them.

If they jumped...

She ran the trajectory calculation.

_Wind resistance: Negligible. Terminal velocity at 80 feet: 50 mph. Belt speed: 40 mph relative. Vector intercept..._

The window for a successful landing was 0.4 seconds.

"The belt!" she screamed, pointing down. "We have to jump for the ore belt!"

"Are you insane?" Ria looked down. "That's a suicide drop!"

"It's the only variable where we don't equal ash!" Angelica shouted. "The math works! Physics doesn't lie!"

Kaelen looked down. He saw the belt. He saw the furnace.

"Probability?" he asked.

"Sixty percent," Angelica lied. It was thirty. "But staying is zero."

The bridge gave another lurch. Sixty degrees. Kaelen's boots were sparking violently now, the magnets failing.

"If we miss, we're ash," Ria said, her voice small.

"If we stay, we're toast," Angelica countered. "Jump on my mark! Timing is everything!"

She watched the governor spinning. She watched the belt moving below.

_Wait for the gap in the slag buckets... Wait for the flat ore slab..._

"Three!" she yelled.

She released her grip on the junction box.

"Two!"

She pushed off the wall.

"Jump!"

They released their holds simultaneously.

The sensation of freefall was immediate and stomach-turning. The heat from the furnace vent blasted them as they fell past it—a wall of thermal force that singes Angelica's eyebrows and curled the ends of her hair. The orange glow filled her vision, blinding, hot, and terrifying.

_Variables,_ she thought, her mind frantic. _Wind shear. Belt velocity. Impact absorption._

They plummeted through the smoke layer.

Below, the conveyor belt rushed by—a blur of grey rock and black rubber.

_Impact._

They hit the belt.

The relative speed difference was brutal. It was like hitting a moving wall.

Angelica hit the rubber, bounced, and rolled. The abrasive ore rocks tore at her uniform and skin. She tumbled uncontrollably, the world spinning in a blur of motion and pain.

Usage of kinetic shielding was impossible; she had no focus. Usage of gravity was impossible; Kaelen was focusing entirely on self-preservation.

Ria, heavier and armored, landed with a crash that cracked a slab of ore. She used her servo-strength to dig her fingers into the tough rubber of the belt, anchoring herself.

"Gotcha!" Ria roared.

She reached out and grabbed Kaelen, who had landed with cat-like grace but was sliding toward the edge.

Then she saw Angelica.

Angelica was tumbling fast, heading straight for the side of the belt. Below the edge, massive gears ground against each other, hungry for debris.

"Wiring-Rat!" Ria screamed.

She lunged.

Ria’s hand clamped around the back of Angelica’s vest. The fabric tore slightly, but the reinforced stitching held. Ria jerked her back, slamming her onto the rubber belt just inches from oblivion.

Angelica lay there, gasping, staring down into the darkness of the gears.

_Too close. Variables miscalculated. Friction coefficient lower than anticipated._

"Up!" Kaelen ordered, dragging them both further onto the center of the belt. "Look up!"

High above, the walkway they just vacated completed its rotation.

_WHAM._

It flipped upside down violently.

A massive fireball erupted from the vent, engulfing the space where they had been hanging seconds ago. The heat wash reached them even down here, a wave of pressure that felt like a slap.

"Too close," Ria breathed, her face pale under the grime.

But the ride wasn't over.

Angelica looked ahead. The belt wasn't heading for an exit. It was heading into a tunnel. A tunnel filled with noise.

_THUD. THUD. THUD._

"Problem," she said, her voice trembling slightly.

"What?" Ria shouted over the din.

"The ore," Angelica pointed at the rocks around them. "It's raw. It needs processing."

"So?"

"So we are riding into the Crusher."

Ahead, the tunnel opened up into a massive chamber. The ceiling was low, lined with rows of hydraulic pistons. Each piston ended in a flat steel plate the size of a car. They slammed down onto the belt in a staggered pattern, crushing the rocks into gravel.

_SMASH. SMASH. SMASH._

Dust plumes erupted with every impact.

"Movement pattern!" Kaelen barked. "Analyze!"

Angelica watched the pistons. It wasn't random. It was a wave.

"Sequence is three-two-one!" she yelled. "Left, Right, Center! We have to weave!"

"Weave?" Ria looked at the massive hammers. "We have to jump! Off the belt!"

"There is no off!" Angelica pointed to the sides. The belt was flanked by sheer walls of smooth steel. There were no walkways. "We ride it or we die!"

The first piston slammed down twenty feet ahead of them. _BOOM._ Rock shards peppered Angelica's face.

"Move!" Kaelen ordered.

They scrambled over the moving rocks.

"Left!" Angelica screamed.

They threw themselves to the left side of the belt. A piston slammed down on the right, pulverizing the boulder Angelica had been sitting on a second ago.

"Right!"

They rolled to the right. The center piston hammered the belt, shaking the rubber beneath them.

"Center!"

They dove for the middle. The left and right pistons slammed down simultaneously.

It was a dance of death. A rhythm game where the penalty for missing a beat was being flattened into paste.

"I hate this beat!" Ria yelled, diving over a pile of gravel as a piston clipped her heel.

"Keep moving!" Angelica shouted. "The frequency is increasing!"

The pistons were getting faster. The gap between impacts was shrinking.

"Integration error," Kaelen observed calmly, dodging a hammer with a minimal side-step. "The machine is accelerating."

"It's a variable load!" Angelica realized. "It detects our mass! It thinks we're a large blockage!"

A massive piston, larger than the others, loomed ahead. It spanned the entire width of the belt. It was the "Master Crusher."

It was rising slowly.

"It's going to drop!" Angelica screamed. "We can't dodge it!"

"Shield!" Kaelen ordered.

"I can't shield a ten-ton hammer!" Ria yelled. "I'm strong, but I'm not _Atlas_!"

"Focus the kinetic barrier!" Kaelen stepped behind her. He placed his hands on her armored shoulders. Violet light poured from his palms into her suit. "I will reinforce using Void-geometry. Brace!"

Ria slammed her boots into the rubber belt. She crossed her arms over her head. Her skin turned a deep, gunmetal grey. The violet energy crackled around her like lightning.

"Do it!" she roared.

Angelica dove behind them, curling into a ball.

The Master Crusher slammed down.

_BOOM._

The sound was absolute. The world turned white.

The steel plate hit Ria's arms.

She screamed. It wasn't a scream of fear; it was a scream of effort. Every servo in her suit whined at maximum output. Her bones groaned.

But the hammer stopped.

It hovered three feet above the belt, held up by a girl made of steel and a boy made of shadows.

"Move, Ward!" Ria hissed through gritted teeth. "I can't hold it... forever!"

Angelica scrambled forward, crawling under the massive steel plate. She reached the other side.

"Clear!" she yelled.

"Drop it!" Kaelen ordered.

He released his grip on Ria and flash-stepped forward, blurring through the gap.

Ria dropped her guard and rolled forward.

The hammer slammed down effectively instantly. _CLANG._ It hit the belt right where they had been standing.

They lay on the other side, gasping in the dust.

"That..." Ria wheezed, clutching her shoulder. "Was heavy."

"We are not finished," Kaelen said, pointing ahead.

The belt continued. The crushing was done. Now came the sorting.

Sonic emitters lined the walls. High-frequency speakers designed to shatter impurities in the ore.

A high-pitched whine began to build.

"Sonic Sorters!" Angelica covered her ears. "It uses resonance to shatter crystal! Cover your ears!"

The sound hit them like a physical blow. It wasn't just noise; it was pain. It vibrated in their skulls.

Angelica felt her nose start to bleed. Her vision blurred.

"It works on bone!" she realized. "It's going to shatter our teeth!"

"Nullify it!" Ria yelled, but her voice sounded tinny and far away.

"I cannot nullify sound!" Kaelen shouted. Even he looked in pain, his stoic mask cracking.

Angelica looked at the emitters. They were delicate glass tubes.

"Resonance!" she thought. _Fight sound with sound._

She grabbed a shard of crystal ore from the belt.

"Ria!" she pointed at the emitters. "Throw rocks! Break the tubes!"

Ria didn't need to hear the words. She saw the gesture.

She grabbed a handful of rocks.

"Pitcher!" she yelled.

She hurled a rock. It smashed into a glass tube. _CRASH._ The sound from that side wavered.

"It works!" Angelica grabbed a rock and threw it. She missed.

"Trajectory!" she corrected. "Variable: Vibration."

She threw again. _CRACK._ Another tube shattered.

They stood back-to-back on the moving belt, throwing rocks at the walls like vandals in a glass factory.

One by one, the emitters shattered. The crushing noise faded, replaced by the simple hum of the belt.

"Silence," Kaelen noted, wiping a trickle of blood from his ear. "I appreciate it."

"Nice arm," Ria told Angelica. "You hit... two. I hit twenty. But nice effort."

"Variables," Angelica panted. "I was calculating."

"Sure you were."

The belt finally began to incline, rising up out of the processing zone.

The conveyor belt carried them out of the Foundry, moving them away from the inferno and into a cooling sector. The air temperature dropped approaching a survivable range. The noise of the pistons faded to a dull thrum.

They rolled off the belt onto a stationary platform, groaning with bruises and exhaustion.

Angelica checked her equipment. Her datapad screen was cracked, but the display flickered with life. Her knife was gone, left jammed in the gear.

"My knife," she whispered. "I liked that knife."

Ria sat up, picking shards of rock out of her armor joints. She looked at Angelica. She looked at the scraped arm where Angelica bled sluggishly.

For the first time, there was no mockery in Ria's eyes. No "Runt." No "Liability."

She realized that the "weak" member of the squad just saved them from certain death using nothing but a knife and a math equation.

"You shorted the governor," Ria said, her voice quiet. "With a knife. You jammed a piece of steel into a ten-ton gear system."

"It was an analog bypass," Angelica said, wiping blood from her lip. "Digital was too slow. I had to introduce a physical friction coefficient."

"You imply that you jammed it," Kaelen said, standing up and brushing soot from his tunic. "You delayed it. A difference of seconds."

"Seconds are variables," Angelica said. "Variables determine outcomes."

Ria shook her head. She started to laugh. It was a low, rumble of a laugh.

"You're crazy," Ria decided. "You're absolutely, certified glitchy."

She reached out a hand to help Angelica up.

"Good eyes, Wiring-Rat."

Angelica took the hand. It engulfed hers.

The nickname hung in the air. Previously, Ria used "Rat" as a slur, a reminder of the Silt. Now, combined with "Wiring," it sounded like a title. A recognition of her ability to survive in the machinery.

Kaelen was watching them. He offered a slight, almost imperceptible nod to Angelica.

"Navigation confirmed," he said. "We proceed. Line 4 is ahead."

"Line 4," Angelica repeated. "Water transport."

"Cleaner," Ria said. "Let's go find some water. I'm parched."

Angelica looked back at the Foundry. She touched the spot where her knife used to be.

"Math saves lives," she whispered. "Ignorance burns. And I am done burning."

She winced as she shifted her weight. The scrape on her arm was deep, bleeding through the fabric of her jumpsuit. She reached for the bio-foam canister in her belt—the one she had salvaged from the trap earlier.

As she sprayed the foam onto the wound, it hissed, sealing the skin. It stung. A sharp, chemical burn.

Across the platform, Kaelen flinched.

He didn't make a sound, but his hand flew to his own arm, gripping the exact spot where Angelica was injured. His jaw tightened.

Angelica stopped spraying. She looked at him.

"You felt that," she said. It wasn't a question.

Kaelen lowered his hand. He looked at her with eyes that were dark, annoyed, and undeniably connected.

"The Pact," he said simply. "It is... resonant."

"I thought it only worked for major trauma," Angelica said, finishing the dressing. "Like dying."

"It seems," Kaelen stood up, flexing his arm, "that our bond is more sensitive than Cromwell advertised. Your pain is my distraction, Ward. Try not to get hit."

"My pain is your distraction?" Angelica stood up too, meeting his gaze. "Then what is your pain to me?"

Kaelen stepped closer. He towered over her, but for the first time, she didn't shrink back. The heat of the Foundry was fading, but the heat between them—the sheer, raw intensity of the bond—was rising.

"My pain," Kaelen whispered, "would shatter you. Do not seek to share it."

"I survived the drop," Angelica said softly. "I survived the trap. I survived the spiders. You might be surprised what I can handle, Kaelen."

He looked at her. Really looked at her. Not as a variable. not as a glitch. But as a partner.

"Perhaps," he said. And for a second, the darkness in his eyes cleared, revealing something human underneath. "Perhaps."

He turned away. "Rest cycle complete. We move."

---

High above, in the highest penthouse of the Zenith Spire, the air smelled of lavender, filtered ozone, and the faint, coppery tang of expensive vintage wine.

Lady Corinne Night reclined on a chaise lounge upholstered in white velvet, a glass of crystalline wine in her manicured hand. The room was a study in excess—floating light orbs, furniture carved from extinct wood, and a panoramic window offering a view of the smog-choked city below.

But the guests weren't looking out the window. They were looking at the floating holographic display hovering in the center of the room.

"It's barbaric," Lord Valerius said, picking a speck of lint from his silk tunic. "Using a hydraulic press on students? The Headmaster is losing his touch. It's too... messy."

"It's efficient," Corinne corrected him, her eyes not leaving the screen. "The Foundry tests resilience. If they can't survive a little pressure, they aren't worth the iron in their blood."

Around her, a dozen of the Academy's elite—patrons, sponsors, and alumni—watched the feed with a mix of boredom and sadism. They treated the Selection like a horse race, placing bets on holopads.

"I have five thousand credits on Squad Iron dying before they reach the Core," a woman in a shimmersilk dress laughed. "The Night boy is strong, but his team? A heavy-lifter and a gutter-rat? Please."

"Don't underestimate the rat," a smooth voice interjected.

Julian Argent stepped out of the shadows near the bar. He wasn't drinking. He was watching the screen with an intensity that made the others uncomfortable.

"Julian," Corinne smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "I didn't think you enjoyed blood sports."

"I enjoy strategy," Julian said, walking over to stand behind her chaise. "And I think you're all missing the most interesting variable in the equation."

He pointed at the screen.

On the display, Squad Iron was tumbling onto the conveyor belt. The feed zoomed in on Angelica Ward.

"That girl," Valerius scoffed. "The Mechanic? She looks like she's about to vomit."

"She just calculated a jump vector in 0.4 seconds," Julian noted. "While hanging from a collapsing bridge. And she hit the landing."

The guests watched as the "Processing Plant" sequence played out. They saw the crushers. They saw the sonic emitters.

When Angelica threw the rock to shatter the emitter, Valerius actually spilled his wine.

"Did she just..." he stammered. "Did she just throw a rock at the arena infrastructure?"

"Disabling the trap," Julian grinned. "Brilliant."

"It's vandalism," the woman in shimmersilk sniffed. "Disrespectful to the Machine Spirit."

"It's survival," Corinne murmured.

She watched the feed as Squad Iron rolled off the belt. She saw the interaction between the giant girl—Ria—and the mechanic. The way Ria helped her up. The lack of mockery.

Corinne’s perfect features remained composed—she was Highborn, after all; emotion was for the poor—but her fingers tightened on the stem of her glass.

"She is knitting them together," Corinne whispered, almost to herself.

"Who?" Julian asked.

"Ward," Corinne’s eyes narrowed. "Kaelen is a solitary weapon. He doesn't know how to lead. He only knows how to destroy. But the girl... she's creating cohesion. She's turning them into a unit."

"Is that a problem for you, cousin?" Julian asked softly. "I thought you wanted Kaelen to succeed. To restore the House name?"

"I want him to succeed," Corinne took a sip of wine. "But I don't want him to be... happy. Attachments make you weak, Julian. You of all people should know that."

"Perhaps," Julian said. "Or perhaps they give you something to fight for."

On the screen, Kaelen nodded to Angelica. The feed cut to a wide shot of the Foundry, showing the squad moving toward Line 4.

"Reeves," Corinne snapped her fingers.

Her aide stepped forward, a datapad in hand. "My Lady?"

"Update the odds," Corinne said loud enough for the room to hear. "Squad Iron to reach the Core. Move them from 50-to-1 to 10-to-1."

A gasp went through the room.

"You're betting on them?" Valerius looked shocked. "After that display? They barely survived!"

"They survived because of the 'gutter-rat'," Corinne said coldly. "And if she can dismantle a Class-4 trap with a rock and a knife, imagine what she can do to Squad Gold."

She looked at Julian. He raised his glass in a mock toast.

"To variables," he said.

"To variables," Corinne agreed, drinking.

She marked Angelica Ward in her mental ledger. Not as a pest. But as a player. A player who needed to be watched—and perhaps, eventually, broken.
