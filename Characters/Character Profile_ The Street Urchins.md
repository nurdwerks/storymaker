# Character Profile: The Street Urchins (Zephyr's Gang)

**Archetype:** The Scavengers / The Lost Innocence
**True Sin:** LUST (Hunger for credits, attention, and the "heroism" of the thief).
**Virtue Mask:** HONESTY (They say the cruel things the adults only think).

## I. Role in the Story

The Street Urchins are a gang of kids in the Neon District that Zephyr feeds and ruffles the hair of. They represent the "community" of the streets.

- **The Cruelty:** They stick their tongues out at Angelica and call her "Ugly lady!"
- **The Laughter:** Zephyr laughs with them and tosses them coins. That easy, uncomplicated laughter hurts Angelica more than any insult, as it highlights the "family" she can never be part of.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Forced Conscription. During a "cleansing" of the Silt sectors, the Street Urchins are rounded up by General Ironwood’s forces and conscripted into the "Juvenile Labor Corps" to work in the Mid-Level factories.
- **Impact on Zephyr:** Zephyr is haunted by his failure to protect the "pups." His lighthearted attitude vanishes, replaced by a cold, burning hatred for the Zenith’s industrial machine. He stops being a rogue and starts being a revolutionary.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Future" is stolen. Without the urchins to provide intel and distractions, the Smuggler’s Ring feels like a dying breed, as the members realize that the Zenith is literally taking the next generation of Silt-siders away from them.
