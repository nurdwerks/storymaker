## Chapter 34: The Sacrifice

### Scene 1: The Realization / The Reactor Antechamber

- **Key Event:** The door to the Reactor Core is sealed. The warning light is a steady, rhythmic crimson pulse.
- **Key Event:** Angelica pulls on the second lead glove. "I'm going in," she says. "Torin, I need you on the helm. Keep the gravity shear to a minimum."
- **Key Event:** Torin doesn't move. He stands in front of the door. His massive frame blocks the keypad.
- **Key Event:** "Move, Torin," Angelica warns.
- **Key Event:** "No," he says. His voice is calm. Too calm.
- **Key Event:** "We clearly discussed this," Angelica snaps. "I'm the Captain. I know the schematic."
- **Key Event:** "You're the Pilot," Torin corrects. "You're the only one who can fly this ship through the wormhole. If you fry your hands in there... who steers?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica freezes. She hadn't thought about the return trip. The radiation would nerve-damage her hands. She wouldn't be able to interface with the nav-computer.
- **Key Event:** "I'm a builder," Torin says. He smiles, a sad, crooked smile. "I make things stand up. You make them go. ... The future needs you more than it needs me."

### Scene 2: The Look / The Antechamber

- **Key Event:** "Torin, don't," Angelica whispers. Her voice cracks. The Captain's mask falls away. She is just a woman looking at the man she loves.
- **Key Event:** Torin takes the gloves from her hands. He puts them on. They are too small for him, but he forces them.
- **Key Event:** "I've been living on borrowed time since the crash," he says. "We both have. This is what I was built for."
- **Key Event:** Tears stream down Angelica's face. "I can't lose you. Not again."
- **Key Event:** Torin cups her face with his gloved hands. The lead is cold, but his touch is gentle.
- **Key Event:** "You won't lose me," he says. "You'll carry me. Every time you look at the stars... I'll be there. In the math. In the steel."
- **Key Event:** He leans in and kisses her forehead. It feels like a benediction.
- **Key Event:** **Internal POV (Torin):** He isn't afraid. He is at peace. He sees the shape of the timeline. He is the foundation stone. She is the spire. The stone has to be buried for the spire to rise.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Torin** — He displays absolute peace and certainty in his decision to sacrifice himself for the mission.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "You won't lose me. You'll carry me. Every time you look at the stars... I'll be there."

### Scene 3: The Choice / The Antechamber

- **Key Event:** The computer screams: **CRITICALITY IN 30 SECONDS.**
- **Key Event:** "Go," Torin says. He turns to the door. He punches in the code: _1-9-9-9_.
- **Key Event:** Angelica grabs his arm. "No! I won't do it! I won't let you!"
- **Key Event:** Torin doesn't look back. He shoves her. Hard.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stumbles back into the corridor. The blast door slams shut between them.
- **Key Event:** She throws herself against the glass porthole. "TORIN!"
- **Key Event:** Inside, the chamber is flooded with blinding white light—Cherenkov radiation.
- **Key Event:** Torin walks into the light. He walks toward the jammed servo. He doesn't run. He marches.
- **Key Event:** Through the speaker, his voice comes one last time. Static-filled. Calm.
- **Key Event:** "Clear the jam. Vent the drive. Fly safe, Angel."
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches as he grips the manual crank. She sees him turn it.
- **Key Event:** The engine hum changes. The scream dies. The thrum returns to a steady beat.
- **Key Event:** Then, the radiation scrubbers kick in, flooding the room with coolant.
- **Key Event:** The white light fades.
- **Key Event:** The room is empty.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. I won't do it. I won't let you."
