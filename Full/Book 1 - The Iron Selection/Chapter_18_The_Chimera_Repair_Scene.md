"We have a schedule to keep," Kaelen repeated, turning toward the exit.

"Yeah, about that," Ria took a step. Her leg seized. The servo in her knee whined—a high, piercing shriek—and locked. Since her suit was essentially an exoskeleton, when it stopped, she stopped.

She tipped over, catching herself on the railing.

"Diagnostic," Kaelen barked.

"Titan strain," Ria grunted, hitting the release on her thigh plate. It didn't budge. "The actuators are fused. I burned out the cooling loop when I went big. I'm a statue, boss."

Kaelen looked at the path ahead. The steam was thickening.

"We cannot carry you," he said. It wasn't cruelty; it was physics. Ria in her armor weighed nearly three hundred pounds.

"Leave me," Ria said. She tried to sound casual, but her eyes were tight. "I'll reboot. Catch up in ten."

"A lie," Kaelen said. "If the actuators are fused, a reboot will not clear the physical blockage. You are immobile."

He looked at Angelica.

"Options?"

Angelica was already moving. She was kneeling by the dead Chimera. She wasn't looking at it with fear anymore; she was looking at it with greed.

"It's a Class-4," she muttered, pulling a multitool from her belt. "High-end hydraulics. Poly-fluid cooling."

She looked back at Ria.

"Your suit uses standard Academy hydraulics, right? Series-9?"

"Series-8," Ria corrected. "Vintage."

"Close enough," Angelica jammed her pry-bar into the Chimera's exposed flank. "The Chimera uses a variable-pressure system for its tail. If I can salvage the pump and the primary lines... I can bypass your blown loop."

"You want to plug _that_ thing into me?" Ria looked at the dead, oil-leaking monster.

"It's either that or you stay here and rust," Angelica snapped. There was a weird energy in her now—the mania of a scavenger who just found a gold mine.

_CRACK._

She leveraged a plate of armor off the lion's side. Underneath, the machinery was dense and wet with oil.

"Hold the light," she ordered Kaelen.

Kaelen didn't argue. He activated a lumen-strip on his wrist and aimed it.

For the next twenty minutes, the Steam-Works wasn't a battlefield; it was a workshop.

Angelica worked with a speed that frightened Ria. She ripped the hydraulic pump—a fist-sized sphere of black chrome—from the beast's spine. She severed the lines with Kaelen's knife, cauterizing the ends with a flare-match to stop the leaking.

"Turn around," Angelica told Ria. "I need access to your lumbar port."

Ria gripped the railing. "Be gentle. It's my first transplant."

Angelica opened the maintenance hatch on Ria's back. Smoke drifted out—the acrid smell of burnt wiring.

"You cooked the motherboard too," Angelica noted. "Titan-form pulls too much voltage."

"It gets the job done," Ria grunted.

"It's inefficient," Angelica stripped the wires. She jammed the Chimera's pump into the cavity. It was too big. She forced it. Metal groaned.

"This is going to hurt," she warned.

"Hurt me," Ria said.

Angelica connected the lines.

_HISS._

The Chimera's black fluid cycled into Ria's suit.

Ria gasped, arching her back.

"Cold," she hissed. "It feels... oily. It feels like it's alive."

"It's just fluid," Angelica said, her hands flying over the connections. "Cycling pressure. 40%... 80%..."

The servos in Ria's legs twitched. They unlocked.

"We have green lights," Angelica closed the hatch. She slumped back, wiping oil and blood from her face. "You're mobile. But don't go Titan again. The Chimera pump pushes higher pressure. If you red-line it, you'll blow your seals."

Ria stood up. She bounced on her heels. The sound of her suit was different now—deeper, throattier. Like a purring cat.

"Thanks, Wiring-Rat," Ria said. She looked at the dead Chimera, then at Angelica.

"Hey," she said softly.

"Yeah?" Angelica was cleaning her tool.

"Before," Ria said. "When you did the... the rewind thing."

Angelica froze. "What about it?"

"I felt it," Ria said. Her voice was very quiet. "I felt the saw."

Kaelen looked up sharply.

"Clarify," he ordered.

Ria rubbed her chest. There was no mark there, but she touched it like a bruise.

"It got me," she whispered. "In the other... time. Whatever. The saw hit me. I felt it cut the armor. I felt the cold. I felt..."

She stopped. She looked at Angelica with wide, terrified eyes.

"I died, didn't I?"

The silence stretched. The steam hissed around them.

Angelica looked at her hands. They were stained with black oil and red blood.

"Yes," she said.

Ria swallowed. She nodded slowly.

"Okay," she said. "Okay."

She didn't thank her. You don't thank someone for un-killing you. It's too big un-killing.

"Let's move," Kaelen said. His voice was harsh, breaking the mood. "The timeline is corrected. The memory is a phantom. Do not dwell on ghosts, Cadet. Focus on the mission."

He walked past Angelica. As he passed, he leaned in.

"You are dangerous," he whispered. "To them. And to us."

"I saved her," Angelica whispered back.

"You broke reality to do it," Kaelen said. "Next time, ask the cost before you pay it."

He moved into the fog.

Ria followed, her new hydraulics purring.

Angelica stood alone for a second. She looked at the Chimera. It was a hollow shell now, harvested and discarded.

_Eat or be eaten,_ she thought. _Scavenge or rust._

She turned and followed her squad.
