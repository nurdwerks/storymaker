## Chapter 2: The Green World

### Scene 1: The Flora / The Crash Site Perimeter

- **Key Event:** Angelica stumbles away from the smoking wreckage of the escape pod.
- **Key Event:** She rips off her helmet. The air hits her.
- **Key Event:** It is thick. Wet. Heavy.
- **Key Event:** She takes a breath and immediately coughs. It’s too rich.
- **Key Event:** Oxygen toxicity. The mixture is different here. Prehistoric.
- **Key Event:** Colors seem to explode. The leaves aren't just green; they are emerald, neon, vibrating with life.
- **Key Event:** A fern the size of a house dominates her vision.
- **Key Event:** "Okay," she mutters, swaying. "Step one: Breathe. Step two: Don't hallucinate."
- **Key Event:** She touches a flower. It snaps shut. Teeth.
- **Key Event:** She recoils. "Aggressive flora. Note to self: Don't touch the salad."
- **Key Event:** The euphoria hits her. She feels invincible. Faster. Stronger.
- **Key Event:** It's a chemical lie, but she uses it. She needs the energy.

### Scene 2: The Fauna / The Clearing

- **Key Event:** The ground shakes. _Thump. Thump._
- **Key Event:** Angelica freezes. She hides behind a massive root system.
- **Key Event:** A creature steps into the clearing.
- **Key Event:** A Megatherium. A giant ground sloth.
- **Key Event:** It is twenty feet tall. Its fur is matted with moss. Its claws are the size of scythes.
- **Key Event:** It casually tears down a tree branch as thick as Angelica's torso and crunches it like celery.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stares. It's a monster. But it's also... majestic.
- **Key Event:** A shadow passes overhead.
- **Key Event:** She looks up. A leather-winged shape blocks out the sun.
- **Key Event:** Pterosaur.
- **Key Event:** "We're not in Kansas anymore," she whispers. "We're in the Cretaceous. Or the Pleistocene. The timeline is a mess."

### Scene 3: The Threat / The Jungle

- **Key Event:** A twig snaps. Not a heavy snap like the sloth. A calculated one.
- **Key Event:** Angelica spins around.
- **Key Event:** Nothing. Just ferns.
- **Key Event:** She knows that feeling. The feeling of eyes on her neck.
- **Key Event:** She backs away slowly.
- **Key Event:** Twin yellow eyes open in the gloom.
- **Key Event:** Low growl. Sub-sonic. It vibrates in her chest.
- **Key Event:** A Smilodon steps out.
- **Key Event:** It is sleek, muscle rippling under tawny fur. The sabers are long, ivory white, and stained at the tips.
- **Key Event:** It lowers its head. It is hunting. And she is the prey.
- **Key Event:** Angelica reaches for her sidearm. It's gone. Lost in the crash.
- **Key Event:** She checks her pockets. A multi-tool. A flare. A shard of titanium alloy she pulled from the wreckage.
- **Key Event:** Not enough.

### Scene 4: The Joke / The Standoff

- **Key Event:** The cat crouches, muscles bunching for the spring.
- **Key Event:** Angelica starts to laugh.
- **Key Event:** It bubbles up from her chest. Hysterical. Oxygen-drunk.
- **Key Event:** "Really?" she asks the cat. "I survived the Fall. I survived the Stone Season. I survived Vane. And this is how it ends? I'm cat food?"
- **Key Event:** The cat pauses, confused by the noise. Prey doesn't laugh. Prey runs.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stops laughing. Her face goes cold.
- **Key Event:** She grips the titanium shard. She wraps her jacket around her left arm—a makeshift shield.
- **Key Event:** She bares her teeth.
- **Key Event:** "You want me?" she snarls. "Come and get me."
- **Key Event:** She steps _toward_ the cat.
- **Key Event:** "The history books said this era was 'lush.' They meant 'deadly.' But I'm deadly too. Come on, kitty. Let's see who bites harder."
- **Key Event:** The cat hisses. It is unsure now. The prey is aggressive. The prey has titanium claws.
- **Key Event:** It backs away, snarling. Then it turns and vanishes into the brush.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands there, shaking.
- **Key Event:** She won. For now.
