# Character Profile: Bio-Engineer Kline

**Archetype:** The Perfectionist / The Sculptor of Flesh
**True Sin:** ENVY (He hates the "messy" natural biology of the protagonist and seeks to "correct" it).
**Virtue Mask:** INNOVATION (He frames his invasive experiments as "Advancing the Species").

## I. Role in the Story

Bio-Engineer Kline is responsible for the physical "upgrades" and genetic monitoring of Aris's subjects. He views the human body as a machine that is constantly breaking down.

- **The Interaction:** He discusses "optimizing" Angelica’s biology in front of her, treating her body as property of the Research Team.
- **The Threat:** His clinical obsession with "fixing" her represents the ultimate threat to Angelica’s identity and agency.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Biological Contamination / Maiming. During an experiment to "optimize" a new viral strain, Kline is accidentally infected. The very virus he helped create begins to systematically "fix" his own biology in a painful, non-consensual way.
- **Impact on Dr. Aris:** Aris views Kline not as a friend, but as a "new specimen." He continues the experiment on Kline, documenting his former engineer’s slow transformation with clinical fascination, shattering the remaining trust of his team.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Sculptor" becomes the "Exhibit." The team loses their technical leader and is forced to watch as Aris treats their former colleague like a lab animal, turning the research lab into a place of sterile, biological horror.

## Consistency Check
