### Scene 1: The Interface Room / The Neural Link

- **Key Event:** The initialization of the neural link between Angelica Ward and the Zenith's core systems begins.
- **Detailed Description:** The Interface Room is bathed in the sterile, pulsing light of the diagnostic monitors. Angelica sits in the Interface Throne, the "Crown" of neural needles already embedded in her skull and spine. The air smells of ozone and antiseptic fluid. As the connection stabilizes, her physical body goes rigid, her eyes rolling back to reveal whites that glow with a faint, golden luminescence. The hum of the ship's reactor deepens, resonating through the floorplates and vibrating in the teeth of everyone present. Cables thick as pythons snake from the base of the throne, pulsing with blue light as data transfers from her biological wetware to the ship's digital architecture.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica experiences a moment of absolute dissociation. The sensation of the needles is replaced by the overwhelming, oceanic pressure of the ship's data. She is no longer just Angelica; she is the air recyclers in Sector 4, the gravity plating in Sector 12, and the engine core itself. The loss of her physical boundaries is terrifying, threatening to dissolve her ego entirely into the machine.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She forces her consciousness to maintain its shape against the flood of data, visualizing a golden wall around her mind to separate "Self" from "Ship."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (via speakers):** "I see it. I see... everything."

- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane initiates his betrayal, overriding the safety protocols from a secondary console.
- **Detailed Description:** Standing in the shadows of the diagnostic cluster, Prelate Vane moves with the fluid, jerky precision of a praying mantis. He extends a cable from the port in his own neck—a direct hardline to his internal Nano-Swarm—and plugs it into the unsecured maintenance port of the Interface Throne. His skin, translucent and pale, flushes with a sudden, sick heat as he uploads his payload. The monitors flicker from blue to a jagged, necrotic green. He does not attack physically; he attacks digitally, injecting the "Override Protocol"—a viral code built from his own consciousness and the Prima-Materia—directly into Angelica's open neural pathway.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane feels a surge of euphoric gluttony. For years, he has sought to transcend the weakness of flesh. As his code bites into Angelica's connection, he feels the intoxicating rush of true immortality. He views Angelica not as a victim, but as a necessary bridge—a "magnificent key" that must be turned and then discarded.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Reveals his ultimate ambition to become a "Machine God" by shedding his flesh and living forever as the consciousness of the Zenith.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "She has done the hard work of opening the door. Now I take the wheel."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I'll take the wheel from here. You were a magnificent key. But keys are meant to be turned."

### Scene 2: The Mindscape (The Golden City)

- **Key Event:** The digital battleground manifests as a distorted version of the Zenith, known as the "Golden City," inside Angelica's mind.
- **Detailed Description:** Inside the neural simulation, Angelica stands in a perfect, golden version of the Zenith's command spire. The sky is a digital white void. Suddenly, the horizon begins to bleed black. Vane's avatar appears not as a man, but as a towering storm of black nanites—a "Swarm" that moves with insectoid buzzing. The Swarm pours over the golden buildings, dissolving the code into static. It looks like a plague of locusts made of glitches. The sound is deafening—a million tiny legs scratching against glass. Angelica's avatar, glowing with golden light, raises a hand to summon a firewall, appearing as a shimmering barrier of hard-light.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica battles panic. In the physical world, she knows how to fight with a wrench or a gun. Here, in the mindscape, her thoughts are her weapons, and Vane's mind is sharper, older, and more disciplined. She feels the physical sensation of the nanites eating her memories—erasing the memory of Leo's smile, the smell of the Undercity—to make room for Vane's code.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Fights a desperate mental battle against the intrusion as her "Golden City" mindscape is invaded by black nanites.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Get out of my mind!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane (The Swarm):** "I am the upgrade. Resistance is inefficient. Surrender your light."

- **Key Event:** Vane's avatar consumes the "Central Spire" of the mindscape, causing Angelica physical seizures in the real world.
- **Detailed Description:** The Swarm coalesces into a giant, skeletal hand that grips the central tower of the Golden City. As the tower crumbles into pixels, Angelica's physical body in the Interface Room arches violently, her spine bending at an unnatural angle. Blood begins to trickle from her nose and the needle-ports in her neck. The monitors scream with warnings: "NEURAL CASCADE IMMINENT. HEART RATE CRITICAL." In the mindscape, the collapse of the spire represents the loss of her motor functions. She falls to her knees in the digital void, her golden light flickering like a dying candle.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane experiences no empathy for the pain he is causing. To him, Angelica's suffering is merely "friction" in the system—heat generated by the replacement of an inferior part. He analyzes the data of her dying mind with clinical detachment, noting the efficiency of his virus.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Pain is data, Angelica. Process it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I am not... a component!"

### Scene 3: The Interface Room (Physical Reality)

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night realizes the betrayal and attempts to intervene physically.
- **Detailed Description:** Kaelen, standing guard by the door, hears the change in the reactor's hum and sees the blood on Angelica's face. He draws his obsidian blade, the metal hissing as it leaves the sheath. He lunges across the room toward Vane, moving with the blur of a Shadow-step. However, Vane does not move. The automated defense turrets of the room—now under Vane's control—spin instantly to track Kaelen. Laser sights dot his chest. Vane's physical body remains motionless, eyes closed, one hand still gripping the cable, while the ship's defenses act as his proxy.
- **Internal Conflict:** Kaelen is torn between the urge to sever Vane's head and the fear that killing Vane while he is hardlined into Angelica might kill her too. The indecision freezes him for a fatal second. He is helpless, watching the woman he loves being hollowed out from the inside by a man he swore to serve.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — His loyalty to the hierarchy finally shatters completely as he realizes the hierarchy is eating its own children.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Vane! Disconnect or I will sever your head!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane (via speakers):** "Do it, and she dies. Our minds are braided. Cut one, the knot tightens."

- **Key Event:** General Ironwood attempts to override the system manually but is locked out.
- **Detailed Description:** Ironwood slams his fist into the tactical console. "Access Denied" flashes in red block letters across every screen on the bridge. The ship's ambient lighting shifts from standard white to the sickly green of Vane's personal signature. The air recyclers stop humming, and the gravity plating fluctuates, making everyone stumble. Vane has not just taken the chair; he has taken the environment.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ironwood feels the impotence of a soldier fighting a ghost. He can shoot a man, but he cannot shoot a virus. His command authority is worthless against code.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane's physical body begins to wither. The skin tightens against the skull as his consciousness flows fully into the machine. He is sacrificing his own biology to fuel the upload, treating his body like a spent fuel casing.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "He's locking us out of life support. He's going to suffocate the crew to save processing power."

### Scene 4: The Mindscape (The Final Push)

- **Key Event:** Angelica finds a "Backdoor" in her own mind—the memory of the Undercity.
- **Detailed Description:** As the Golden City burns, Angelica retreats to the "basement" of her mind. The gleaming spires are replaced by the rusted, dripping tunnels of Sector 12. Vane's pristine, geometric Swarm struggles to navigate the chaotic, messy, illogical architecture of the Undercity memory. The nanites get stuck in the digital "mud" and "grease" of her past. This is a place Vane does not understand—a place of poverty and disorder. Angelica manifests a weapon here: her old, rusted hyper-spanner, glowing with defiant light.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica realizes that her "imperfections"—her trauma, her poverty, her hunger—are the only things Vane cannot replicate or consume. They are her firewall. She embraces the "Silt-Rat" identity she tried to hide, using it as a shield.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — turns her greatest shame (her origin) into her greatest defense.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** " You can't map this, Vane. You've never been hungry."

- **Key Event:** Vane realizes the trap too late as the "Silt" code begins to corrupt his perfect algorithm.
- **Detailed Description:** The black Swarm begins to rust. The nanites slow down, heavy with the digital weight of "inefficiency." Vane's avatar screams—a sound like tearing metal—as the chaotic data of the Undercity overwrites his clean, sterile code. He tries to pull back, to disconnect, but Angelica's avatar grabs the Swarm with her glowing hands, holding him in the mud.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane feels genuine fear for the first time. He encounters a variable he cannot calculate: the strength of "Entropy." He worshiped evolution, but he forgot that evolution requires chaos.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "This data is corrupted! It's filth!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's home."
