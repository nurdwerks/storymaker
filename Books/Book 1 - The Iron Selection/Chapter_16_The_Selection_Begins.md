## Chapter 16: The Selection Begins

### Scene 1: The Drop

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Headmaster Vane:** "The rest will be recycled."

- **Key Event:** The bay floor drops without warning. Fifty bodies plummet into the clouds.

- **Key Event:** Angelica sees the Arena: a Clockwork Metropolis the size of Manhattan—brass, copper, and grinding iron gears. The entire city is moving. She lands hard on a metal grate in Sector 7.

### Scene 2: The Landscape

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron regroups via comm-beads. Kaelen fires a shadow flare. They meet on a water tower.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Landed in Sector 7. Grid coordinates unstable."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "I landed... inside a clock tower? I think I'm on a giant minute hand."

### Scene 3: The First Blood

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I remove the other players."

- **Key Event:** They begin moving toward the Spire.
