# Chapter 2: The Interception

Angelica's hood snapped violently in the artificial draft as she ducked into the lee of a rusted ventilation housing. The journey back from the Sector 1 pharmacy had taken three hours—three hours of crawling through maintenance tunnels slick with condensation, of avoiding the sweep patterns of security drones, of clenching her jaw against the pain radiating from her bruised ribs where she'd slammed into a pipe junction during her escape. Every breath tasted of copper and regret.

She wiped a smudge of oily film from her modified welder's lenses, the sharp, high-contrast green of the HUD flickering as it struggled to lock onto the Hab-Block's thermal signature through the industrial haze. Her hands were shaking. Not from fear—she'd burned through that particular emotion hours ago—but from exhaustion. Her muscles were screaming, her fingers numb from gripping rusted ladders. She'd pushed herself past the point where her body politely suggested rest and into the territory where it was actively threatening mutiny.

But she had the medicine. The real medicine. The kind that came in sterile packaging with holographic authenticity seals. The kind that worked.

"Clear," Sparky chirped, the drone's voice modulator a thin whisper against the background roar of the sector's exhaust fans. The little medical drone had been monitoring her vitals for the past hour, occasionally chirping warnings about her elevated heart rate and declining blood sugar. She'd told it to shut up twice.

"Stay close," she murmured, her own voice tight. Her throat was raw from breathing the Silt's toxic air without her filter—she'd ditched it two sectors back when a patrol had gotten too close.

She reached for the maintenance ladder of the Hab-Block—a decaying monolith that seemed to weep condensation from every cracked pipe. The structure groaned in the wind, the metal skeleton creaking like the bones of a dying giant. Forty floors. She'd climbed it a thousand times. It never got easier.

The cold iron bit into her palms as she began the climb, the 40th floor feeling a thousand miles away. Her satchel, heavy with stolen pharmaceuticals, bumped against her hip with every rung. Each vial inside represented a small fortune on the black market. Each one represented another day Leo could breathe. She could feel their weight like a promise—or a debt.

Every vertical inch was a battle against the wet weight of the Silt's air and the rhythmic, grinding vibration of the city's foundations. The mega-structure was never quiet. Even at this hour—0300 by her cracked wrist-comp—the city breathed, churned, processed. Somewhere far below, the great recyclers were grinding yesterday's trash into tomorrow's building materials. The River flowed eternal.

Her muscles burned, but the adrenaline of the pharmacy heist was still a steady hum in her blood, keeping the exhaustion at bay. _Just get home. Just get to Leo. Just—_

She reached the blast door of Unit 404, her fingers trembling as she punched in the changing lock code—a new sequence every day, paranoia baked into routine. The door hissed open with a pneumatic sigh, and the relative silence of the room was immediately drowned out by the sound she feared most.

Leo's breathing.

It was a wet, desperate rasp—the sound of gears grinding without oil. Angelica dropped her bag, the vials of medication rattling as she rushed to the mattress in the corner.

"Leo," Angelica whispered, dropping her bag. She rushed to him.

He opened his eyes. They were glassy, fever-bright. "Angie?"

"I got it," she said, her hands shaking as she pulled a blister pack of _Respi-Clear_ from her pocket. She fumbled with the foil, popping a blue pill into her palm. "I got the good stuff. Open up."

Leo swallowed the pill dry. He coughed, a violent, hacking spasm that shook his thin frame. Angelica held him, rubbing his back, feeling the heat radiating off him. He was burning up.

She waited. She watched the timer on her retinal display. _Absorption time: 5 minutes._

Five minutes passed.

The rattling didn't stop.

She grabbed the _Nano-Scrub_ injector. "Okay, we try this. It's stronger."

She pressed the device to his neck. _Hiss._

Ten minutes.

Leo's breathing hitched. He gasped, a horrible, wet sound that clawed at something primal in Angelica's chest. His small body arched off the mattress, back bowing, hands scrabbling at his throat as if he could physically tear the obstruction away. He was fighting for air that wouldn't come, drowning in his own inflamed tissue.

"No," Angelica whispered. "No, no, no. Work. Damn you, work."

She activated her ocular implant, switching to diagnostic mode with a blink-sequence she'd practiced a thousand times. She focused on Leo's chest. The overlay flickered to life, a heads-up display of his vital signs projecting directly onto her retina. The thermal map of his lungs bloomed into view—a false-color nightmare of reds and angry oranges.

They weren't clearing. The blue zones—areas of healthy oxygen exchange—were shrinking with each labored breath, retreating like islands in a rising tide. The red zones—inflammation and particulate blockage—were spreading like a wildfire through dry brush, consuming the healthy tissue. The Silt wasn't just coating his lungs; it was _bonding_ to them at a molecular level, the microscopic metal fragments and toxic compounds creating a crystalline matrix that grew with every breath. The cheap pharmaceuticals, even the mid-tier stuff from the Sector 1 pharmacy, couldn't dissolve it. The beta-agonists were trying to force open airways that were being actively sealed shut. It was like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon. It was like trying to clean oil with water.

The numbers scrolling across her vision were damning. Oxygen saturation: 82%. Blood pressure: 140/95. Heart rate: 135 and climbing. His body was trying to compensate, pushing harder, burning itself out in a futile attempt to survive.

"It's not working," Leo wheezed, his small hand clutching hers with a grip that was weak—terrifyingly weak compared to even yesterday. "Angie... it's heavy. My chest... it's so heavy."

His voice was barely a whisper, each word costing him precious breath.

"Shh," she smoothed his hair back from his forehead. It was damp with sweat, plastered to his skull. His skin was fever-hot beneath her palm, burning with the immune system's futile war against an enemy it couldn't comprehend. "I know, sweetie. I know. It's just... it takes time. The medicine needs time to work."

She was lying. She knew she was lying. The implant's readout was clear: no improvement. Decline accelerating.

"It's not working," he repeated, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes, cutting tracks through the grime on his pale cheeks. "I can feel it. Inside. It's like... like concrete. Like someone poured concrete in my chest and it's getting harder."

Angelica stood up abruptly. She walked to the other side of the room, away from him, moving on autopilot. She needed distance. If she stayed there, kneeling beside him, watching him drown, she would break. And if she broke, who would save him?

She leaned against the cold metal wall, pressing her forehead against it, feeling the chill seep into her skull. Her hands were clenched into fists so tight her nails dug into her palms, the pain a small, sharp anchor in a sea of panic.

Panic, cold and sharp as a blade between the ribs, drove itself into her chest. She had risked everything. She had bypassed Guild security protocols designed by minds far sharper than hers. She had raided a protected pharmacy, nearly been caught by automated defenses. She had burned favors and luck and nearly her own life. And for what? For pills that were barely compressed sugar to a disease this aggressive. For medicine that was failing in real-time, powerless against the Silt's slow, patient murder.

"Sparky," she hissed. "Analysis."

The drone floated over, hovering by her shoulder. "Subject: Leo Ward. Condition: Critical. Acute Particulate Fibrosis, Stage 4. Standard beta-agonists are ineffective due to silicate bonding."

"Solution?"

"Medical recommendation: Hospice care. Palliative sedation."

"Don't give me the Zenith handbook answer!" Angelica snapped, keeping her voice low so Leo wouldn't hear the desperation bleeding through. "Give me a real solution. Something I can do. Something I can steal, build, or beg for."

The drone whirred, its processors cycling through medical databases, cross-referencing symptoms with treatments, probability matrices flickering through its logic cores. "Theoretical solution: Class A Steroidal Solvents with Nanite Suspension. Molecular-grade lung scrubbers. Regenerative tissue scaffolding. Combined treatment regimen shows 73% survival rate in Stage 4 Particulate Fibrosis cases."

"Where?" Angelica demanded.

"Only available in Sector 1 Medical Hubs or military stockpiles. Probability of successful acquisition given current resources and security parameters: 0.04%."

There it was. The number. The wall.

Sector 1. The Zenith. The pinnacle of the city, where the towers pierced the smog layer and touched clean sky.

Angelica closed her eyes, her mind already war-gaming the approach. It was a suicide mission. The Zenith wasn't just another sector—it was a different world. It was where the wealthy lived, kilometers above the Silt, breathing scrubbed air pumped through HEPA filters and drinking water so pure it had been distilled from clouds. The security there wasn't just guards with stun batons and bad attitudes; it was layered defense systems designed by military AI, thermal tracking grids that could spot a rat at two hundred meters, biometric scanners at every junction, and Wardens—the elite enforcers who served the Prelates directly. They were augmented, ruthless, and trained to kill.

Breaking into Sector 1 wasn't a heist. It was a declaration of war against the most powerful people in the city.

She had no plan. No allies. No leverage. Just desperation and a half-broken piece of scavenged tech strapped to her forearm.

But she looked back at Leo. He had closed his eyes again, his small body utterly still except for the hitching rise and fall of his chest. Each breath was a labor, a battle he was slowly losing. He was drowning on dry land, suffocating in millimeters, dying by degrees.

She thought about the numbers Sparky had quoted. Stage 4. Thirty percent lung capacity. Days, maybe a week at most. And then...

No.

"0.04%," she murmured, letting the number settle in her mind. Four chances in ten thousand. Impossible odds. But impossible wasn't zero. Four in ten thousand meant someone, somewhere, had beaten those odds. Someone had threaded that needle. "Better than zero."

She turned back to the room, her movements sharp and decisive now that the decision was made. She grabbed her satchel and upended it violently, dumping the useless _Respi-Clear_ pills onto the floor. They scattered like pale blue confetti, worthless. She began to pack the real gear, the tools of her trade. Her climbing harness—woven from scavenged optical cable. Her hyper-spanner—a sonic multi-tool she'd built from three broken models. Her datapad—cracked screen held together with electrical tape, but the processor was solid. And the glove—the Haptic Glove she had spent months building from scrap, the device that let her speak to machines in their own language.

"Angie?" Leo's voice was barely a whisper. "Where are you going?"

She knelt beside him. She kissed his forehead. "I have to go out for a bit, Leo. Just for a bit."

"Is it... dangerous?"

"No," she lied. "Just a supply run. I need... batteries. For the heater."

"Okay," he wheezed. "Come back."

"Always," she promised.

She stood up. "Sparky. Stay here. Monitor him. If his O2 drops below 80, cycle the room ventilation to max."

"My directives require me to assist you," the drone protested.

"New directive: Keep him alive until I get back," Angelica ordered. "If you fail, I will dismantle you into paperclips."

"Acknowledged," the drone said, sounding slightly offended.

Angelica pulled her mask up. She locked the door behind her.

She didn't look down at the Silt as she climbed the maintenance ladder to the roof of the hab-block. She looked up. Way up.

Past the smog layer. Past the neon signs of the mid-levels. Past the patrol drones.

To the pinpricks of light far above, where the air was clean and the people were cruel.

She began to climb. She didn't take the lifts; they were monitored. She took the skeleton of the city—the vent shafts, the cable risers, the exterior maintenance rungs. Mile after vertical mile. The air grew thinner, colder, and cleaner. The smell of rot faded, replaced by the sterile scent of ozone.

It took her four hours to reach the underbelly of Sector 1. Her fingers were bleeding. Her muscles were screaming. But she didn't stop.

She found a maintenance hatch near the thermal exhaust of the Medical Hub. She bypassed the lock—old tech, barely worth a yawn—and slipped inside.

The silence of Sector 1 hit her first. It was a physical weight, pressing against her ears.

It was a lie.

To the unrefined ear—the ear of a tourist, a mid-level bureaucrat, or one of the soft, pampered citizens who lived their entire lives under the artificial sun lamps—the Medical Hub was quiet. The sound dampeners hidden within the pristine, pearl-white walls swallowed echoes before they could be born. The floors, carpeted in a friction-absorbent synthetic weave that cost more per square foot than a year's rent in the Silt, were cushioned to mute the sharp click of boots. Even the air recyclers hummed at a specific, engineered frequency—432 Hertz—chosen by Zenith psychologists to induce a subconscious state of calm and compliance in the biological brain. It was a cathedral of hush, a sanctuary of stillness suspended high above the grinding, screaming, mechanical chaos of the Undercity.

But to Angelica Ward, hanging suspended upside down sixty feet above the polished white tiles, the room was screaming.

She closed her eyes for a heartbeat, forcing her breathing to slow, fighting the vertigo that wasn't about the height, but about the _cleanliness_. The air up here didn't taste right. It lacked the metallic tang of copper, the heavy, wet weight of the Silt, and the underlying scent of old regrets. It smelled of lavender, ionized ozone, and money. It smelled like a world where things didn't break. It smelled like indifference.

She hated it. It made her skin itch. It made her feel like a bacteria on a sterile slide.

She retuned her senses, ignoring the obvious inputs—the distant, rhythmic _thump-hiss_ of the hydration pumps three floors down, the soft, insect-like whir of the cleaning drones scrubbing the grout of the lobby. She pushed her awareness deeper, reaching for the invisible layer of the world that she lived in.

The grid.

It was a cacophony. A storm of invisible noise that battered against her skull. To her, the sensors lining the maintenance catwalk she was suspended from were violently loud, vibrating with a low-voltage hum, a B-flat tone that drilled into her molars. The motion detectors sweeping the floor below were clicking in a staccato rhythm—_sweep, click, sweep, click_—like a metronome set to a chaotic, shifting tempo. And underneath it all was the heavy, oceanic roar of the data-stream, the sheer volume of information flowing through the optical cables embedded in the walls: patient records, inventory logs, security protocols, temperature gauges, biomass readings.

It wasn't a wall. It was a symphony. A chaotic, discordant, beautiful symphony of code. And she had to play the counter-melody.

"Okay," she whispered, the sound barely escaping her lips, a ghost of a word in the vast, empty space. "Let's make some jazz."

Angelica adjusted her harness. It was a piece of art, really—braided optical cable she’d scavenged from a defunct server farm in Sector 9. The fibers possessed a tensile strength that could hold a small car, yet were flexible enough to wrap around her waist like a second skin. It was light, silent, and invisible to thermal scans—unlike the standard-issue climbing gear used by the Guild breakers, which radiated heat like a beacon. She had spent three weeks weaving it herself, sitting in the dark of her workshop, her fingers blistered and raw.

She was suspended from a structural beam in the high ceiling, hidden in the deep, geometric shadows between the luminescent light arrays. Below her, the Medical Hub stretched out like a sterile canyon. White desks. White chairs. White walls. It was blindingly bright, even with the "Night Mode" engaged, a stark contrast to the eternal twilight of the Silt. It felt like being inside the belly of a great white shark.

Sixty feet down.

If she fell, the impact would liquidate her. If she slipped, the motion sensors would paint her with enough target-lock lasers to give her a tan before the automated security turrets dropped from the ceiling panels and vaporized her.

She lowered herself inch by inch. The auto-winch on her hip, modified with sound-dampening foam and lubricated with high-grade synthetic oil, fed the line out smoothly. _Zip... zip... zip..._

Her target was the ventilation grate of Storage Locker 4-Alpha.

It was located twenty feet up the north wall, a small, unobtrusive square of mesh that supposedly led to the clean-air return. In reality, as Angelica had discovered after three weeks of analyzing leaked architectural schematics and cross-referencing them with energy consumption patterns, it was a direct line into the pediatric storage vault.

She had studied the blueprints until they were burned into her retinas. She had hacked the repair drone to map the patrol routes. She knew the shift changes of the guards down to the second. But blueprints didn't tell you the atmosphere. They didn't tell you that the lights hummed in a way that made your teeth ache. They didn't capture the crushing weight of the silence.

She reached the level of the grate. She stopped, hanging in the void, rotating slowly. Note to self: steal better bearings for the swivel next time.

She pulled her Haptic Glove from her belt.

It was a monstrosity. To a Zenith engineer, it would look like garbage—something to be thrown in an incinerator without a second thought. It was a standard-issue industrial lifting glove, the kind used by dock workers, but she had stripped the armor plating and replaced it with a web of exposed, tangled circuitry. Wires, stripped from old comm-units and duct-taped to the knuckles, ran to a bank of stolen processors strapped to her forearm. It looked like a bomb. It looked like a mess.

But to Angelica, it was a conductor's baton. It was a skeleton key for the digital age.

She reached out. Her fingers hovered over the biometric keypad next to the grate. The keypad was a sleek, black square of obsidian glass, pulsing with a faint red standby light. It looked inert, but she knew better. It was waiting to bite.

"Don't wake up," she murmured to the lock, her voice a soothing lullaby. "Just sleep. Dream of open doors. Dream of being a welcome mat."

She touched the panel.

Instant resistance.

The keypad didn't just read fingerprints; it read bio-impedance, pulse rate, skin conductivity, and capillary flow patterns. It was running a "Watchdog" protocol, standard Zenith military-grade encryption.

It felt like sticking her hand into a beehive.

The code swarmed her, aggressive and stinging. It wasn't just checking her ID; it was interrogating her. It probed the sensors in her glove, looking for a match, looking for an authorized user, looking for a flaw. It was angry code, sharp and jagged, written by someone paranoid.

_Who are you? Identify. AUTH_FAIL. Querying database. Isolate subject. Deploy Counter-Measures._

Angelica didn't fight it. You didn't fight a Watchdog; it was faster than you. It could cycle a million queries in the time it took her to blink. If she tried to brute-force it, it would lock down the building and summon the death-squads before she could type "Run."

You didn't fight the river. You swam with it. You confused the current. You made the water doubt which way was down.

She flexed her fingers. The processors on her arm spiked hot, the heat radiating through her flight suit. She flooded the keypad's input buffer with noise—white noise, random data, thousands of false bio-signals per second.

_I am Dr. Aris. No, I am Nurse Crane. No, I am a maintenance droid. No, I am a gust of wind. I am a bird hitting the sensor. I am a ghost. I am nothing._

The Watchdog hesitated. It was built to stop a breach, but it wasn't built to handle an identity crisis. The code faltered, the aggressive swarm slowing as it tried to parse the flood of contradictory data. It spun its wheels, trying to verify a thousand ghosts at once.

_That's it,_ Angelica thought, a savage grin tugging at the corner of her mouth behind her mask. _Get confused. Get dizzy. Chase your tail, you stupid, expensive piece of glass._

She isolated the lock's solenoid command—the physical "open" signal. It was buried under layers of encryption, hidden behind the bio-scan, wrapped in a logic puzzle. But with the Watchdog distracted, chasing phantom doctors and digital birds, the path was clear. It was a narrow gap in the armor, a single beat of silence in the noise, a crack in the wall.

She tapped her pinky finger against the sensor plate. A single, distinct pulse of code. A precisely aimed dagger.

_Open._

The light on the panel flickered. Red. Amber.

Green.

_Click._

The sound was loud in the silence, like a gunshot. Angelica froze, her heart hammering against her ribs, sounding like a war drum in her own ears. She waited. Five seconds. Ten.

No alarm. No sirens. No red strobe lights washing the room in panic. The symphony of the room continued uninterrupted, the B-flat hum of the sensors unchanged.

She exhaled, a long, shuddering breath. "Too easy," she whispered, her confidence returning. "You people are so arrogant you don't even lock your windows. You think your height protects you. You think your money protects you. You forgot about gravity. Gravity brings everything down eventually."

She grabbed the edge of the grate and pulled. It swung open on well-oiled hinges, silent as a whisper.

The shaft beyond was dark, smelling of cold metal and filtered air. It was a narrow throat leading into the belly of the beast. Angelica swung her legs forward, catching the lip of the opening with her boots. She detached her primary line, automatically anchoring a safety tether to the grate frame, and slipped inside.

She was in.

Storage Locker 4-Alpha was less a room and more of a vault. The temperature was near freezing to preserve the volatile compounds, the cold biting through her jacket instantly. Rows of stainless steel shelves lined the walls, floor to ceiling, filled with canisters, vials, and boxes. They were organized with obsessive precision, labeled with holographic tags that shimmered in the low light.

Angelica tapped her temple. Her ocular implant—a scavenged piece of tech she’d installed herself with a mirror, a scalpel, and a bottle of whiskey because she refused to pay a back-alley butcher—flashed a low-light overlay. The room turned a ghostly monochrome green.

She scanned the labels, her eyes darting across the inventory.

_Adrenaline. Morphine. Synth-Blood. Neuro-Blockers._

Useful. Valuable. In the markets of Sector 12, a vial of pure morphine could buy a week of safety. A box of Synth-Blood could buy a new identity.

But that wasn't why she was here. She wasn't here for profit. She was here for survival.

She moved deeper into the vault, her boots silent on the metal grating.

_Crate 815... 817... 819._

She stopped.

_Crate 819: Pediatric Steroid Inhalers. Class A. Long-Acting Beta-Agonists with Nanite Suspension._

Jackpot.

She stared at the crate. It wasn't just medicine. This was a month of clean breathing. This was Leo sleeping through the night without waking up gasping, clutching his chest, his eyes wide with the terror of drowning in dry air. This was hearing him laugh without it turning into a coughing fit. This was life.

She reached for the crate. It was mag-locked, of course. A simple magnetic seal.

"Open up," she whispered, placing her glove on the latch. This lock was simpler, a basic inventory tag reader, not a Watchdog. She spoofed the signal in three seconds, broadcasting the ID of a restocking bot.

The lid hissed open.

Inside, resting in foam cutouts like precious jewels, were rows of silver inhalers. They gleamed in the low light, pristine and perfect.

Angelica felt a lump in her throat. It was so much. There were fifty units here. In the Silt, one of these would trade for a working hover-bike. A box? A box was a ticket out. A box was a king's ransom.

She grabbed a handful, stuffing them into her satchel. She grabbed another. The cold metal of the canisters felt good against her fingers. Solid. Real.

Then she saw the crate next to it. _Cellular Scrubbers._

The expensive stuff. The stuff that repaired the lung tissue, not just opened the airways. The stuff that could actually reverse the scarring for a while.

"Greedy," she scolded herself in her head. "Don't be greedy. Greedy gets you caught. You have what you need."

She reached for it anyway. Just one canister. Just one for the bad days.

The hum stopped.

It wasn't a fade-out. It was a cut.

The ambient noise of the ventilation fans, the distant thrum of the building's power grid, the recycling pumps—it all vanished instantly. The constant background roar of data she felt in her teeth... gone.

The air pressure in the room dropped. Her ears popped painfully.

The silence was sudden, absolute, and unnatural. It was heavier than the noise. It pressed against her eardrums. It was physical.

Angelica froze, her hand halfway to the second crate.

In the Silt, silence meant one thing: The predator had stopped moving. The predator was watching.

This wasn't a malfunction. A malfunction would be noisy—alarms, grinding gears, backup generators kicking in, emergency lights flashing. This was a command. Someone had killed the room. Someone had reached into the heart of the building and squeezed.

Then the lights went out.

Pitch black. Not just dim—absolute darkness. The emergency strips didn't kick in. The equipment LEDs died. It was as if the universe had just been turned off.

Angelica dropped into a crouch instantly, her hand flying to her belt, drawing her hyper-spanner. She activated her ocular implant’s night vision.

Nothing.

Static.

"What..." she hissed. Her implant wasn't broken; it was jammed. A powerful electromagnetic blanket had just been thrown over the room, blinding her sensors.

She was blind. She was deaf to the grid. She was alone with the cold.

"System diagnostic," she whispered.

_Error. Signal Jammed. External interference detected._

She backed up slowly until her back hit the shelving unit. She needed a wall. She needed cover.

Then, a sound.

_Click._

A single light flickered on at the far end of the vault. It wasn't an emergency light. It was a spotlight, focusing on a single, empty point in the aisle.

_Click._

Another light, ten feet closer.

_Click._

Another.

The lights were marching towards her. Someone was controlling them manually, stepping them closer, hunting her with illumination.

Angelica scrambled to the side, rolling under a workbench, making herself small. She held her breath.

The lights stopped ten feet away from her hiding spot.

Then, the voice came.

"You compensate well for sensory deprivation," it said.

The voice was everywhere. It came from the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It was un-amplified, yet it filled the room. It was smooth, calm, and terrifyingly amused.

"Your heart rate spiked to 140 beats per minute when the lights failed," the voice observed. "But it dropped to 95 within three seconds. You didn't panic. You assessed. Commendable."

"Who's there?" Angelica shouted, her voice echoing in the dark. "Show yourself!"

"I am showing you," the voice replied. "I am showing you the fragility of your control. You rely on your eyes. You rely on your implant. You rely on the grid singing to you. What are you when the song stops, Miss Ward?"

The spotlight moved. It swung directly onto her hiding spot.

The light was blinding. Angelica shielded her eyes, squinting against the glare.

"I asked you a question," the voice said, closer now. "improvisation is your gift. Let's see you improvise."

The shelf above her groaned.

Angelica didn't think. She rolled.

_CRASH._

The heavy steel shelving unit she had been hiding under collapsed, the bolts sheared clean off. Canisters exploded, spraying chemical foam everywhere.

Angelica scrambled to her feet, backing away into the dark. It wasn't an accident. Someone had cut the bolts.

"Reflexes: Above average," the voice noted. "But your situational awareness is lagging. You are looking at the threat, not the environment."

"Come out!" Angelica screamed, waving her spanner. "Stop playing games!"

"Games?" the voice sounded insulted. "This is not a game. This is a stress test."

_Tap. Tap. Tap._

The sound came from behind her. From above.

It was distinct. Metallic. Deliberate. A rhythmic tapping on the railing of the maintenance catwalk she had just descended from.

_Tap. Tap. Tap._

It was the sound of a patience that had run out.

Angelica’s blood turned to ice. A cold shiver ran down her spine, sharper than the chill of the locker. She slowly, very slowly, turned around.

She looked up at the vent she had entered through.

Standing on the catwalk, framed by the stark white light of the corridor beyond, was a figure.

He was tall, impossibly tall, his silhouette elongated by the flowing, pristine white robes of the High Ministry. The fabric didn't hang; it draped, moving with a fluid grace that suggested it was woven from spider silk and smoke. A high collar framed a face that was severe, gaunt, and terrifyingly serene.

It was a face she knew. Every child in the Undercity knew it. It was the face that looked down from the massive holo-projections on the Day of Atonement, when the Prelates delivered their annual sermon about duty and sacrifice and the necessity of the gears turning. The Minister of Charity and Distribution. The administrator of the food credits. The man who decided who ate and who starved.

The Glutton.

Prelate Vane.

He wasn't looking at the vent. He was looking _through_ it. Through the darkness, through the smoke, through the metal grating. He was looking directly at her, pinning her in place with a gaze that felt like it could peel back her skull and read the thoughts underneath.

His eyes were not human. Where there should have been sclera and iris and the wet, vulnerable biology of sight, there was only solid glowing blue light—two perfect circles of luminescence set in his gaunt face like gems in a skull. Multi-Spectral Oculars. Military-grade cybernetic replacements that could see in infrared, ultraviolet, and electromagnetic spectrums. Eyes that could watch her heartbeat through her chest wall, count the beads of sweat on her forehead, read the micro-expressions of fear she couldn't completely suppress.

He tilted his head slightly, studying her the way a collector might study a particularly interesting insect before pinning it to the board.

He was alone. No guards flanking him in formation. No drones circling in protective patterns. No Wardens in tactical gear. Just him, standing on the catwalk in his flowing white robes, utterly unafraid. That confidence was more terrifying than an army. It meant he didn't need backup. It meant he was the weapon.

"You missed a semi-colon on line 400," Vane said.

His voice was like the room—smooth, expensive, carefully modulated. But there was something underneath the cultured tones, something that suggested a furnace carefully banked. Utterly cold on the surface. Infinitely hot beneath.

"In your bypass script," he clarified, as if they were colleagues discussing a code review over tea. "The Watchdog algorithm. Your spoofing routine was elegant—genuinely impressive for someone with no formal training—but you left a syntax error on line 400. Sloppy."

He smiled. It didn't reach his glowing eyes.

"Sloppy syntax for a virtuoso," he continued, stepping closer to the railing with movements that were too fluid, too precise. Enhanced musculature. Augmented reflexes. He wasn't just watching her through inhuman eyes; he was moving with inhuman grace.

Angelica didn't wait for him to finish.

She didn't try to hack. She didn't try to negotiate. Those were tools for people who had leverage. She had none.

She threw the Haptic Glove.

She ripped the heavy, modified gauntlet from her arm and hurled it with every ounce of strength she had. It wasn't aimed at Vane. It was aimed at the shelving unit next to him—the one holding the Class-4 Flammables.

Vane didn't flinch. He simply watched the glove sail through the air.

_CRASH._

The glove hit a canister of _Ether-Kerosene_. Sparks from the exposed wiring ignited the fumes instantly.

_BOOM._

A fireball erupted, filling the upper catwalk with orange fury. The shockwave rattled the teeth in Angelica's skull. Smoke, thick and black, billowed instantly, blinding the sensors, confusing the grid.

"Disappointing," she heard Vane's voice calmly cut through the roar of the fire. "Crude."

But she was already moving.

She sprinted for the waste chute. It was a gamble—a suicide run. The chute led to the incinerator, but there was a service hatch on the sub-level 4 junction. If she could hit the catch while falling...

She dove.

She slid into the dark, oily throat of the chute just as the fire suppression foam cannons exploded from the ceiling.

She fell.

Darkness. Wind. The smell of rot.

She counted. _One. Two. Thr—_

She slammed her boots against the sides of the chute, friction burning through her soles. She grabbed the maintenance rung as she flashed past.

_Wrench._

Her shoulder popped. Pain blinded her for a second. But she held on.

She swung herself into the service hatch, tumbling out onto a rusted grating in the Undercity ventilation network.

She was out.

She lay there for a minute, gasping, clutching her satchel. She checked the pockets.

The inhalers were there. The Class A steroid shots.
