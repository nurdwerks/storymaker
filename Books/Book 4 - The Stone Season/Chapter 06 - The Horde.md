# Chapter 6: The Horde

---

### Scene 1: The Alarm

- **Key Event:** The group reaches the "Sector 12 Ventilation Hub," only to find the thermal dampeners have failed, causing a massive heat spike that alerts the local Blighted.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Obsessively monitors his sensors, prioritizing the collection of "baseline acoustic data" of the screams over the group's safety.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Listen to the frequency. It's not a scream; it's a handshake. They're triangulating our position based on the heater's output."

### Scene 2: The Wave

- **Key Event:** A massive wave of Blighted (the "Horde") surges from the ventilation shafts, moving with unexpected coordination.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "That's not a crowd. That's a tide. And tides don't stop for brass."

### Scene 3: The Stand

- **Key Event:** Ria holds the choke point at the hub entrance, using a scavenged heavy-industrial welder as a field-expedient weapon to incinerate the lead Blighted.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Displays no fear, viewing the battle as a purely mechanical problem of "flow control."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Too many variables. I need to thin the herd. Cover the left vent."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ria! They're flanking us!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Let them. I have more fuel than they have skin."

### Scene 4: The Escape

- **Key Event:** The group escapes into a secondary maintenance tunnel, sealing the hub behind them, though they hear the Blighted beginning to tear through the steel door.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Forces the group to leave behind a crate of medical supplies to move faster, choosing survival over comfort.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Drop the meds. We can't use them if we're dead. Move!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "We might need those."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need speed more. That's a command."
