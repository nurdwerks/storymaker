# Chapter 14: The Winter Ball

The summons arrived with the morning nutrient paste.

The Academy cafeteria was a cavernous, utilitarian space that smelled perpetually of boiled starch and recycled air. It was a place of grey noise—the clatter of metal trays, the drone of the ventilation fans, and the low, anxious murmur of three hundred cadets trying to eat fast enough to make it to their 0800 tactical simulations.

Outside the reinforced transparisteel viewports, the Spire was wrapped in the eternal twilight of the Silt fog. At this altitude, the smog thinned just enough to reveal the bruised purple bruise of the sky, where the sun tried and failed to pierce the chemical haze. Occasional flashes of lightning from the storms in the lower atmosphere illuminated the distant skeletal frames of the sector towers, ghostly monuments to a city that had forgotten how to build anything new.

Inside, the air was regulated, sterile, and cold. The temperature was kept intentionally low—another subtle reminder that comfort was a privilege, not a right.

Angelica sat at the end of a long durasteel table, flanked by Ria and Jax. She was staring at her breakfast—a grey, gelatinous cube that wobbled when she poked it with her spork. Condensation from the cooling units dripped rhythmically from the ceiling pipes, marking time like a slow, torturous metronome. _Drip. Check. Drip. Check._

"It's protein," Jax said helpfully, shoveling a massive spoonful into his mouth. "Just close your eyes and pretend it's steak."

"I've never had steak," Angelica muttered. "So I'm pretending it's rat-skewer. And it's still disappointing."

Ria didn't eat. She was dissecting her cube with surgical precision, separating the edible gel from the gritty filler. She looked tired. Her eyes were rimmed with red, and she kept rubbing her left wrist, where the neural-cuff had chafed her skin during yesterday's interrogation resistance training.

"Something's coming," Ria said suddenly, her head snapping up.

"What?" Jax asked, pausing mid-chew.

"Listen."

Angelica strained her ears. At first, she heard nothing but the usual cafeteria din—the scrape of cheap metal on plastic, the hiss of the beverage dispensers. Then, she heard it. A low, harmonic hum. Like a swarm of angry bees.

The noise grew louder. Conversations died out. Heads turned toward the high, vaulted ceiling.

Then they appeared.

Drones. Dozens of them. But these weren't the clunky, rust-bucket surveillance drones that patrolled the Silt. These were sleek, chrome spheres that moved with fluid, anti-gravitic grace. They shimmered under the harsh halogen lights, their polished surfaces reflecting the upturned faces of the cadets below.

"Courier Drones," Ria whispered. "Zenith Class."

The swarm descended. They didn't land randomly. They had targets.

One hovered over the table of the Gold Squad. It dropped a heavy, cream-colored envelope onto the tray of a tall, blonde boy who looked like he had been bred in a laboratory for aesthetic perfection. He smiled, as if he had been expecting it.

Another drone drifted toward the Silver tables, delivering an envelope to a girl with cybernetic eyes.

The room erupted in whispers.

"The Winter Ball," Jax said, his voice hushed. "The Invitations."

"It's a summons," Ria corrected, her voice dripping with venom. "The Highborns are going shopping. They want to inspect the livestock before they buy."

Angelica watched as a drone broke formation. It didn't go to the Gold table. It didn't go to the Silver table.

It drifted toward the Iron section.

It hovered over their table. The hum was deafening now, a focused vibration that rattled Angelica's teeth. The drone's single, blue optic lens dilated as it scanned them.

It ignored Jax. It ignored Ria.

It locked onto Angelica.

"No," Angelica whispered.

The drone chimed—a pleasant, melodic sound that felt completely out of place in the grim cafeteria. A slot opened in its underside.

A heavy cream envelope fell.

It landed in the center of Angelica's tray, right on top of her protein cube.

The drone spun and zipped away, rejoining the swarm near the ceiling.

Silence. Absolute, terrifying silence. Every eye in the cafeteria was fixed on Angelica. She could feel the weight of their stares—confusion, jealousy, pity, and from the Gold table, open hostility.

Angelica stared at the envelope. It was real paper. Thick, textured, and expensive. It was sealed with red wax, stamped with the crest of the Zenith Council—a gear wreathed in laurels.

"Don't touch it," Ria warned. "It's poison."

Angelica's hand trembled as she reached out. She picked it up. It was heavy. It smelled of vanilla and old money.

She broke the seal. The wax cracked with a sharp snap.

She pulled out the card. The calligraphy was elegant, hand-written in gold ink.

_Cadet Angelica Ward,_

_Your presence is mandated at the Annual Winter Solstice Gala._

_Assessment of Social Suitability and lineage compatibility is required._

_Formal Attire Mandatory._

_Do not fail to attend._

_- The Office of Prelate Vane_

"Mandatory," Angelica read, her voice hollow.

"He's playing with you," Ria said. "Vane. He's throwing you into the shark tank to see if you bleed."

"I don't have formal attire," Angelica said, panic rising in her chest. "I have a jumpsuit. I have a mechanic's coveralls. I have... rags."

"You don't need a dress, Angel," Ria said, her dark eyes narrowing as she looked at the Gold table, where the Highborns were laughing. "You don't need silk. You need armor. These people smile while they stab you. They toast to your health while they poison your wine."

Jax looked at the invitation, then at Angelica. "You can't go. It's a trap."

"It says 'Do not fail to attend'," Angelica said, flipping the card over. "That's not an invitation, Jax. That's an order. If I don't go, I get demerits. Enough demerits and I wash out. If I wash out..."

"Back to the Silt," Jax finished grimly.

Angelica gripped the card until the heavy paper creased.

"I'm not going back," she said. It was her mantra. Her prayer. "I'll go. I'll wear a sheet if I have to. But I'm not going back."

---

The Academy Supply Depot was located in the sub-basement, a sprawling warehouse of crates and automated dispensers. Usually, it was quiet, smelling of dust and packaging foam.

Today, it was a war zone.

The "Formal Wear" section—a dusty aisle near the back usually ignored by cadets—was being raided. The Highborn girls from Squad Gold and Silver had descended upon it like locusts. They were pulling silk gowns and velvet jackets from the racks, shrieking with delight or disdain.

Angelica stood at the end of the aisle, feeling small and dirty in her grease-stained jumpsuit.

She stepped forward.

"Out of the way, Silt," a voice drawled.

Angelica froze.

Standing by a rack of shimmering blue gowns was Corinne. Lady Corinne of House Aurum. She was beautiful in the way a knife is beautiful—sharp, cold, and dangerous. Her golden hair was pulled back in a severe braid, and her eyes were the color of polished coins.

She held a dress against her body—a cascade of liquid silver nano-fabric that rippled like water.

_It fits,_ she thought, admiring her reflection in the polished metal rack. _Silver on Gold. A challenge to house Argent. Let them see who really shines._

"This section is for people with a future," Corinne said, not even looking at Angelica. "The janitorial supplies are in Aisle 4."

"I got an invitation," Angelica said, her voice steady despite the hammering of her heart.

Corinne paused. She turned slowly, looking Angelica up and down with an expression of mild nausea.

_Look at her,_ Corinne thought, disgust curling in her stomach. _Grease. Sweat. She stands like a dog waiting to be kicked. How can Vane allow this? It's not just an insult; it's a hygiene violation._

"An invitation," Corinne repeated. She laughed. It was a light, tinkling sound, like breaking glass. "Oh, you poor thing. You think that means you're _invited_? It means you're the entertainment. Prelate Vane needs a clown for the circus."

She stepped closer. The air around her seemed to get heavier.

_Break her,_ a voice whispered in Corinne's head. _If you don't break her, they'll think she belongs._

"You don't belong here, Ward," Corinne whispered. "You smell like rust. You smell like the bottom of the world."

She flicked her wrist. A small, subtle gesture.

_Just a nudge,_ she told herself. _Just to remind her of gravity._

Angelica felt it. A wave of force. A Gravity Push.

It wasn't enough to hurt, but it was enough to unbalanced her. Angelica stumbled backward. Her boots caught on a floor grate. She fell, crashing into a large bin marked _DISCARDS / RECYCLING_.

The bin was full of old, moth-eaten clothes. Angelica landed in a pile of musty wool and torn lace.

Laughter erupted from the other girls.

"Oops," Corinne said, smiling. "Clumsy. Go wear a trash bag, Ward. It suits your lineage. Leave the silk for the people who matter."

She turned her back, dismissing Angelica as if she were nothing more than a spilled drink.

Angelica lay in the bin, her face burning. Shame, hot and prickly, washed over her. She wanted to cry. She wanted to run.

She grabbed a handful of fabric to pull herself up.

Her hand closed around something heavy. Stiff.

She paused.

It wasn't wool. It wasn't lace. It felt like canvas. Like synthetic weave.

She pulled it out.

It was a dress. But barely.

It was a military dress uniform from the Pre-Collapse era. It was made of heavy, matte fabric in a color that wasn't quite black and wasn't quite grey. It was the color of storm clouds. The color of iron filings.

_Dissident Grey._

She knew the color. Her father had told her stories about it. Before the Spire, before the Iron Law, there had been a rebellion. The Engineers. The Artificers. They had worn this color as a symbol of their refusal to paint over the truth. They believed that function was beauty. That the machine should be naked.

The dress was severe. High collar. Long sleeves. A structured bodice with brass buttons that had tarnished to black. The skirt was long and straight, slit up the side for movement, not for display.

It was moth-eaten. The hem was frayed. There was a stain on the shoulder that looked suspiciously like old blood.

Corinne would call it trash.

Angelica looked at it. She ran her thumb over the rough fabric.

She didn't see trash. She saw a chassis. She saw a foundation.

She saw a weapon.

Why was she trying to look like them? Why was she trying to wrap herself in silk and pretend she wasn't from the Silt? That was their game. And she would always lose their game, because they made the rules.

So she wouldn't play their game.

She would change the board.

She gripped the heavy uniform.

"Iron," she whispered to herself. not gold. "Iron."

She climbed out of the bin, clutching the grey uniform to her chest like a shield. She didn't look at Corinne. She didn't look at the silk gowns. She walked past them, head high, carrying her history in her arms.

---

The Machine Shop was empty at 0200 hours.

It was Angelica's sanctuary. The smell of oil and ozone calmed her. The hum of the fabricators was a lullaby.

She wasn't in the sewing room. She didn't have a needle and thread. She had a soldering iron, a spool of kinetic-dampening wire, and a stolen micro-battery from a defunct servo-droid.

The grey dress lay on the workbench, dissected.

She wasn't tailoring it. She was engineering it.

"Aeon," Angelica called out softly. "Status?"

The Gryphon's voice resonated in her mind, clear and sharp in the quiet workshop. _ACTIVE. SYSTEMS NOMINAL. QUERY: WHY ARE WE INTERFACING WITH TEXTILES? MY DATABASE INDICATES WARFARE PROTOCOLS ARE PRIORITIZED._

"This is warfare," Angelica muttered, sliding her magnification goggles over her eyes. "Social warfare. I need armor."

_SCANNING TARGET OBJECT..._

A beam of green light shot from the drone module on her workbench, sweeping over the tattered dress.

_OBJECT IDENTIFIED: DISSIDENT OFFICER UNIFORM. MARK IV. MANUFACTURER: THE FREE GUILD OF ENGINEERS. ERA: PRE-UNIFICATION._

"Is it salvageable?"

_STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY: 42%. FABRIC TENSILE STRENGTH: COMPROMISED. RECOMMENDATION: REINFORCE WITH KINETIC WEAVE._

"Way ahead of you," Angelica said.

She picked up the spool of kinetic-dampening wire. It was thin, silver, and incredibly strong.

"I need to line the bodice," she explained, more to herself than to Aeon. "If I weave this in a hex-pattern, it should act like a Faraday cage. It'll ground any electrical discharge."

_LOGICAL,_ Aeon agreed. _HOUSE SILVER IS KNOWN FOR ELECTRO-KINETIC WEAPONRY. PROBABILITY OF ARCS IN A SOCIAL SETTING: 23%. PROBABILITY OF 'ACCIDENTAL' DISCHARGE: 89%._

"Exactly."

She began to work. She didn't sew so much as fuse. She used the soldering iron to melt the wire into the synthetic fabric of the dress, creating a hidden lattice of silver veins.

"Tell me about them," Angelica said as she worked. "The Dissidents. The ones who wore this."

_DATABASE ACCESSING... THE DISSIDENTS WERE A FACTION OF TECHNOCRATS WHO OPPOSED THE GOLDEN LAW. THEY BELIEVED THAT MAGIC WAS JUST UNQUANTIFIED SCIENCE. THEY REFUSED TO WORSHIP THE EMPEROR AS A GOD. THEY WORSHIPPED THE MACHINE._

"Did they win?"

_NEGATIVE. THEY WERE PURGED. REASON FOR FAILURE: THEY LACKED UNIFICATION. THEY FOUGHT ALONE._

Angelica paused. Her hand hovered over a tarnished button.

"They fought alone," she repeated.

She looked at the dress. It was a relic of a failed revolution. A symbol of people who had stood up and been crushed.

"We won't make that mistake," she whispered.

_QUERY: WE HAVE ALLIES?_

"We have each other," Angelica said. "And we have a dress that's going to scare the hell out of them."

She moved to the skirt.

"Silhouette," she said, picking up a sheet of heat-resistant Mylar she had scavenged from the recycling chutes. "It's too flowy. I need it rigid. Sharp. Like a blade."

She cut the Mylar into long, tapering strips. She inserted them into the lining of the skirt. When she applied heat, the Mylar shrank and hardened, giving the skirt a rigid, architectural shape. It didn't flow. It didn't swish. It held its lines like the hull of a ship.

Finally, the aesthetics.

She looked at the tarnished brass buttons. They were boring. Passive.

She drilled a micro-hole through the center of each button. She threaded fiber-optic cable through the collar and down the front placket, connecting each button to the micro-battery she had sewn into the hem.

She connected the leads.

_Click._

The dress hummed. A low, barely audible vibration.

The buttons didn't glow with the warm, inviting yellow of a candle. They pulsed with a cold, electric blue light. _Cherenkov radiation blue._ The color of a reactor core going critical.

It was a warning light. _Danger. High Voltage._

_AESTHETIC ANALYSIS COMPLETING..._ Aeon chimed. _INTIMIDATION FACTOR: HIGH. STYLE: UTILITARIAN CHIC. YOU LOOK LIKE A WARSHIP._

"Good," Angelica said.

She picked up the dress. It was heavy now. It weighed ten pounds.

She stripped off her jumpsuit and stepped into it.

It was cold against her skin. It was tight. It forced her to stand straight, pulling her shoulders back, lifting her chin. It restricted her breathing just enough to make her conscious of every breath.

She walked to the polished metal sheet she used as a mirror.

She gasped.

The girl in the reflection wasn't a Silt-Rat. She wasn't a mechanic. She wasn't a victim.

She looked like a general of a dead army.

The grey fabric absorbed the light, making her look like a shadow cut from the air. The blue lights pulsed in time with her heartbeat—a slow, steady, terrifying rhythm. The rigid skirt moved with her, not around her.

She looked severe. She looked cold.

She looked unbreakable.

"Function is beauty," she whispered, touching the cold blue light at her throat.

She reached into her tool belt and pulled out two handfuls of steel ball bearings. She verified the hidden pockets she had sewn into the sleeves—gravity-assisted release chutes. With a flick of her wrist, she could drop a bearing into her hand. A simple, kinetic projectile.

Just in case.

She took a deep breath. Possibility filled her lungs.

"Let's go to the ball."

---

Ria was waiting for her in the dorms.

The room was cramped, smelling of stale air and cleaner fluid. Riot sat on the edge of her bunk, filing a jagged piece of scrap metal into a shim. When Angelica walked in, wearing the finished dress, Ria dropped the file.

"Holy shit," Ria whispered.

"Too much?" Angelica asked, turning slowly. The dress moved with her, the Mylar panels shifting like tectonic plates. The blue lights pulsed in the dim room.

"It's not a dress," Ria said, standing up. "It's a declaration of war. You look... dangerous."

"I need to be," Angelica said. "But there's a problem."

"What?"

"I don't know how to dance," Angelica admitted, sinking onto her own bunk. The stiff skirt crunched against the mattress. "It's a ball, Ria. I can look like a warship, but if I trip over my own feet, Corinne wins."

Ria laughed. It wasn't a mocking sound; it was a genuine, dusty chuckle.

"You think they're going to dance?" Ria asked. "They're going to circle each other like sharks. But... you're right. Protocol matters."

Ria walked over to the center of the small room. She kicked a pile of laundry under her bed to clear a space.

"Get up," Ria ordered.

"You know how to dance?" Angelica asked, skeptical.

"I know how to move," Ria corrected. "Combat footwork and waltz steps aren't that different. It's all about weight distribution and predicting your opponent's momentum. In combat, you step in to strike. In a waltz, you step in to turn. Same principle."

She held out her hands.

"Left hand on my shoulder," Ria instructed. "Right hand in mine. Back straight. Chin up. Look at me, not your feet. If you look at your feet, you look weak."

Angelica stood up. She placed her hand on Ria's shoulder. The contact was grounding.

"Now," Ria said. "The basic box step. Forward, side, together. Back, side, together. One, two, three. One, two, three."

Ria moved.

She was surprisingly graceful. For someone who fought like a brawler, she moved with a fluid, liquid economy. She guided Angelica through the steps.

"One, two, three. One, two, three."

Angelica stumbled. Her heavy combat boots—hidden under the dress but still clunky—caught on the floor.

"Don't fight the floor," Ria said. "Own it. Plant your foot. Assert dominance over the tile."

"It's dancing, not wrestling," Angelica grumbled, resetting her stance.

"It is wrestling," Ria countered. "It's wrestling in 3/4 time. You are negotiating space. You are saying 'I am here, move for me'. If you hesitate, they will walk all over you."

They tried again.

"One, two, three."

"Better," Ria said. "Now, the turn. Pivot on the ball of your foot. Use your hip."

They spun. The rigid skirt of Angelica's dress flared out, the Mylar panels catching the light.

"Imagine Corinne is watching," Ria said, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Imagine she's waiting for you to fall. Every step is a punch in her perfect face. Every turn is a dodge."

Angelica closed her eyes. She imagined the ballroom. The music. The gold. The judgment.

She stepped forward. _One._

She moved her leg. _Two._

She brought her feet together. _Three._

She wasn't dancing. She was marching. But she was marching to a rhythm that only she could hear.

"Good," Ria whispered. "Again."

They danced in the cramped dorm room for an hour, the only music the hum of the ventilation system and the rhythmic _thud-thud-thud_ of Angelica's boots.

By the time they stopped, Angelica was sweating, but she wasn't stumbling.

"You're ready," Ria said, stepping back. "You step like a soldier."

"Is that a compliment?"

"In that room?" Ria grinned. "It's the highest compliment there is. Now go. And if anyone tries to cut in... break their toes."

---

The Grand Ballroom was a sensory assault.

It was located at the very apex of the Spire, under a geodesic dome of transparent duraglass. The night sky was the ceiling. The stars looked close enough to touch, cold and indifferent diamonds scattered on black velvet.

The room itself was massive. The floor was polished marble, veined with gold. Floating drift-lights, suspended in anti-grav fields, cast a warm, golden glow over the crowd.

The smell hit Angelica first. Expensive gardenia perfume, roasted game birds, and the metallic tang of ozone from the atmospheric scrubbers. It was the smell of wealth.

The sound was a wall of noise. A live orchestra—real people playing real instruments, a luxury unheard of in the lower levels—was playing a waltz. The strings swelled and dipped, masking the polite laughter and the clinking of crystal glasses.

Standing at the top of the grand staircase, Angelica paused.

Below her, the Highborns swirled. It was a sea of color. The girls wore gowns of shifting light, silk, and velvet in every hue of the rainbow. The boys wore formal military dress uniforms in white and gold, their chests adorned with medals they hadn't earned.

They looked like peacocks. Preening, strutting, desperate to be seen.

Dominating the center of the room was a massive hologram. It was twenty feet tall, translucent and shimmering.

**The Emperor.**

He sat on his Golden Throne, his face hidden behind a gold mask, his armor intricate and terrifying. He didn't move. He just watched. His holographic eyes seemed to follow everyone in the room. The Highborns bowed slightly every time they passed beneath him, a reflex of fear and reverence.

"Name?" the Doorman asked. He was a synthetic, his face a blank metal mask.

"Cadet Ward," Angelica said.

The Doorman paused. His optical sensors whirred as he scanned her attire. If a robot could look confused, he did.

"Affiliation?"

"None," Angelica said.

The Doorman hesitated, then turned to the room. He amplified his voice.

"Cadet Angelica Ward. Unaffiliated."

The music didn't stop, but the conversation near the stairs did. Heads turned.

Angelica took the first step.

She didn't float. She didn't glide.

_THUD._

Her combat boot, hidden beneath the grey hem, hit the marble with a heavy, deliberate sound.

_THUD._

She took another step.

The sound was jarring in the delicate atmosphere. It was the sound of industry. The sound of work.

She descended the stairs. She didn't smile. She didn't look down. She looked straight ahead, her face a mask of calm.

The grey dress seemed to drink the light. In a room full of shimmering peacocks, she was a void. A black hole. The only light on her was the cold, radioactive pulse of the blue LEDs at her throat and waist.

_Thrum-thrum... Thrum-thrum..._

The crowd parted. They didn't mean to, but they instinctively moved away from her. She looked dangerous. She looked like she might explode.

Corinne was standing near the chocolate fountain, holding court with a group of Aurum cadets. She turned, a glass of champagne in her hand, ready to mock.

The glass slipped from her fingers.

_SMASH._

The crystal shattered on the marble. Champagne pooled around her silk slippers.

Corinne stared. Her mouth opened slightly, then closed. She looked for a flaw. She looked for a stain. She looked for something to laugh at.

She found nothing.

Then, a slight smirk of approval touched her painted lips.

_Well done,_ she thought. _Well played._

Angelica walked past her. She didn't stop. She didn't look at Corinne. She just kept walking, the heavy _thud-thud-thud_ of her boots marking her passage.

She reached the bottom of the stairs and stood in a circle of empty space.

"Charming entrance," a voice purred from her left.

Angelica turned.

A boy stood there. He was tall, thin, and pale, with hair the color of spun sugar. He wore the blue and silver of House Argent. His eyes were like chips of ice. Julian Argent. He held a glass of clear, bubbling liquid, his little finger extended in an affectation of elegance that looked more like a claw.

"Julian Argent," he said, bowing with exaggerated flourishing. "I must say, I admire the... courage. Or is it audacity? It's a fine line."

"It's practical," Angelica said, her voice flat. She kept her hands near her sides, ready to trigger the sleeve mechanisms.

"Practical?" Julian laughed softly. It was a wet sound. "My dear, nothing here is practical. This is a display. This is theater. And you... you are displaying something very specific."

He stepped closer, invading her personal space. He smelled of mint and cold metal, a sterile scent that reminded her of the medical bay.

"You're displaying a threat," he whispered, his voice dripping with false concern. "That uniform. My grandfather spit on men wearing that uniform before he had them executed. It's a ghost story. A bad memory."

"Ghosts are only scary if you have a guilty conscience," Angelica replied, meeting his gaze.

Julian's smile faltered for a fraction of a second. His eyes narrowed.

"Clever," he said. "Projecting confidence. But we both know it's a façade. You don't know the steps, Ward. You don't know the music. You are just making noise."

"The music is just vibration," Angelica said. "The steps are just geometry. Everything is a machine, Julian. Even this party."

Julian sneered. "A mechanic's philosophy. Reduce everything to nuts and bolts because you can't understand the soul. You think you can engineer your way into society? You think because you put lights on a rag, it becomes a gown?"

He leaned in, his voice dropping to a hiss.

"You are Silt, Ward. You effectively have mud in your veins. And do you know what we do with mud in the Spire?"

"You walk on it," Angelica said.

"We pave over it," Julian corrected. "We seal it away so it doesn't stain our boots. You are a glitch. A mistake in the algorithm. And do you know what we do with glitches?"

He reached out, his hand hovering near her waist. His fingertips sparked with a faint, silver light—electro-kinesis. A subtle shock. Just enough to make her flinch, to make her spill a drink, to make a scene.

"We delete them."

Just as his hand moved to touch her—aiming for the gap in her armor—Angelica reacted. She didn't flinch. She triggered the sleeve mechanism.

_Click._

A steel ball bearing dropped into her hand.

She caught it and squeezed.

"I wouldn't," she said softly.

She held her hand up, letting the ball bearing roll between her fingers. It was heavy, cold, and undeniably a weapon. A simple, brutal piece of steel.

Julian froze. He looked at the steel ball, then at her eyes. He saw the calculation there. The willingness to escalate. He felt the hum of the Faraday cage she had woven into the bodice. He realized his shock would ground out harmlessly.

"How crude," he sneered, but he pulled his hand back, the sparks dying on his fingertips.

"Practical," Angelica repeated. "It's not about the soul, Julian. It's about leverage."

She dropped the bearing back into her pocket with a heavy _clack_.

"Excuse me," she said. "I believe there's a punch bowl. And I find the air here suddenly...stale."

She walked away, leaving Julian staring after her, his face pale with a mixture of rage and confusion. He had brought a rapier to a gunfight, and he knew it.

She made her way to the refreshment table, feeling the eyes of the room on her back like physical weights. The judgment was heavy. She could feel it pressing against her mind—a thousand petty thoughts, a thousand sneers. _Trash. Rat. Ugly. Poor._

She closed her eyes for a second.

_Push back._

She didn't use her hands. She used her mind. She found that knot of pressure in her gut—the same one she had used in the locker room—and she untied it.

She didn't blast them. She just... projected.

She broadcast a thought on an open frequency. It was raw. It was loud. It was a mental shout that cut through the polite psychic chatter of the room like a siren.

_Stare all you want._

The telepaths in the room winced, clutching their temples. Several people stumbled. The music seemed to waver for a second.

_I am the wrench in your gears. Deal with it._

She opened her eyes. Her pupils were dilated, rimmed with a faint violet light that matched the blue of her dress.

The circle around her widened. Fear. She tasted it. It was distinct from the disgust she had felt earlier. It was sharper. Cleaner.

"Impressive," a dark voice said.

Angelica turned.

Leaning against a marble pillar, half in shadow, was Kaelen Night.

He was wearing House Night formal wear—black on black, high collar, no medals. The fabric seemed to absorb the light around him, much like her own dress. He held a glass of dark red wine, but he wasn't drinking.

He looked at her with an expression she had never seen on him before. It wasn't hatred. It wasn't indifference.

It was respect.

"You cleared the floor," Kaelen said, pushing off the pillar and walking toward her, his movements silent and predatory. "Not even I can do that without drawing a blade. You have a talent for crowd control, Mechanic."

"I didn't mean to," Angelica lied, though her heart was hammering against the reinforced bodice.

"Yes, you did," Kaelen corrected smoothly. "You projected. A broad-spectrum telepathic shove. Very sloppy. Very loud. It was like shouting in a library. But effective."

He stood in front of her. He was taller than her, and even in formal wear, he radiated a sense of violence. He wasn't attacking, but he was assessing. Reading her like a schematic.

He looked at her dress.

"Dissident Grey," he murmured. "A bold choice. My father killed the last man who wore that color in this hall. It was forty years ago. The 'Engineer's Revolt'. They tried to storm the dais."

"What happened to them?" Angelica asked, refusing to look away.

"They were dismantled," Kaelen said. "Literally. My father believes that if a machine malfunctions, you take it apart."

"People aren't machines," Angelica said.

Kaelen tilted his head, his black eyes narrowing. "Aren't we? We have input. We have output. We have programming—House, Lineage, Duty. What are we if not biological machines executing a script written by dead men?"

He gestured to the room, to the swirling dancers.

"Look at them," he said. "They are running a program. 'The Winter Ball Protocol'. Smile. Bow. Flatter. Betray. It is a loop. An infinite, decaying loop."

"And you?" Angelica asked. "Are you just running a program?"

Kaelen froze. The question seemed to catch him off guard. He looked at his wine glass, watching the dark liquid swirl.

"I am... debugging," he said softly. "I am looking for the error in the code. The anomaly."

He looked back at her.

"You are an anomaly, Ward. You don't fit the pattern. You wear the uniform of a dead rebellion, but you fight with the desperation of the living. You project telepathic noise, but your mind is..."

He tapped his temple.

"Blocked. Shielded."

"Barricaded," Angelica corrected.

"Barricaded," Kaelen repeated, tasting the word. "Yes. I saw your barricades. Crude. Rusty. But effective."

He took a step closer. The air between them crackled with tension. It wasn't romantic; it was magnetic. Two poles pushing against each other.

"Julian was right, you know," Kaelen whispered. "You are a glitch. But Julian is a fool. He thinks glitches should be deleted."

"And what do you think?"

Kaelen turned his gaze to the holographic Emperor spinning above them. The golden mask stared down, unblinking.

"I think glitches are the only thing that proves the system is still running," he said. "If the machine was perfect, it would be dead. Static. Entropy requires disorder. You... you are chaos, Ward. And chaos is the only thing that moves forward."

He turned back to her, his expression intense.

"The Spire is stagnating, Angelica. We are rotting from the inside out. We have perfected our cage. We need someone to rattle the bars."

"Is that why you didn't report me?" Angelica asked. "In the study? Why you kept my file?"

"I kept your file because you are interesting," Kaelen said. "And because I am bored. Boredom is a dangerous thing for a man like me. It makes me... experimental."

He raised his glass in a mock toast.

"Don't let them break you, mechanic," he whispered. "They will try. Corinne will try. Vane will try. Even I might try, if the mood strikes me."

"I don't break," Angelica said. "I bend."

Kaelen smiled. It was a genuine smile this time, sharp and terrifying.

"We shall see."

He drained his glass.

"But it would be a shame to break something so... functional."

He turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows of the mezzanine like a ghost returning to the haunt.

Angelica stood alone by the punch bowl. Her heart was racing. Her skin tingled where the air had touched him.

She looked at her reflection in the polished surface of the silver punch bowl. The blue lights of her dress pulsed. Her eyes were still glowing faintly violet.

She wasn't just a survivor anymore. She wasn't just a scavenger hiding in the mud.

She was a player. She had walked into the lion's den, worn the skin of their enemy, and stared down the prince of darkness.

She took a crystal cup and filled it with punch. She took a sip.

It was sweet.

But it tasted like victory.
