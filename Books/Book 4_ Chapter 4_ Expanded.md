### Chapter 4: The Pathogen

#### Scene 1: The Vial

Morning—or what passed for it in the eternal twilight of the crash site—brought no sunlight, only a dimming of the fires outside. The air inside the module was recycled, stale but warm, a stark contrast to the freezing void just beyond the walls. Angelica woke to the sound of glass clicking against glass, a rhythmic, almost musical sound that cut through the silence.

Dr. Aris was standing over a workstation, holding a vial up to the light. The liquid inside was hypnotic. It was black, viscous, and moved with a life of its own. It climbed the walls of the glass container, defying gravity, forming spikes and tendrils that reached for the heat of Aris’s hand. It looked like **Ferro-Fluid**, but it moved with intent, pulsing rhythmically like a secondary heart.

"Is that...?" Angelica asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She felt stiff, her muscles aching from the fall, her skin feeling too tight.

"Prima-Materia?" Aris finished for her, not turning around. He shook his head. "No. Prima-Materia is the engine. This... this is the exhaust. Or perhaps the driver."

He placed the vial in a centrifuge. "Vane called it the 'Cure'. He believed it would rewrite the human genome to survive the Void. He thought he could engineer a species that didn't need oxygen, didn't need sleep, didn't need love. He wanted to strip us down to our most efficient parts."

"And?" Angelica sat up, wrapping her arms around her knees.

"And he was right," Aris smiled, a gruesome baring of teeth that showed too much gum. "But he forgot that survival does not imply humanity. This is the disease."

#### Scene 2: The Explanation

The others were waking up now, roused by the conversation. Ria was checking her weapons, disassembling her shotgun with practiced ease, oiling the mechanism with a drop of scavenged fluid. Zephyr was trying to eat a nutrient bar with one hand, grimacing at the taste which likely resembled cardboard and vitamins. Kaelen sat apart, polishing his gorget, trying to look dignified despite the dirt on his coat and the tremor in his hands.

"Vane's experiments," Aris explained, his voice taking on the lecture tone of a professor addressing a dim class. "He wanted to evolve us. He used the Captain's blood—your blood, Miss Vance—as a base. But he diluted it. He mixed it with synthetic polymers and ancient viral strains found on the hull."

He brought up a holographic diagram. It showed a DNA helix being torn apart and stitched back together with black threads. The diagram was violent, red warning lights flashing at every junction where the new code forced itself onto the old.

"The result wasn't Ascension," Aris said, tapping the hologram. "It was simplification. The virus strips away higher brain functions. Empathy, logic, language, memory, art, regret—all expensive, calorically speaking. It deletes them to save energy. It streamlines the processor."

"So it makes them stupid?" Zephyr asked, mouth full.

"It makes them focused," Aris corrected. "What is left when you remove the soul? The Lizard Brain. The basal ganglia. Hunger. Rage. Speed. The imperatives of a predator. It turns a man into a perfect survival machine. It removes the hesitation of morality."

"It removes the person," Kaelen said, his voice quiet but sharp. "It's murder."

"It's evolution," Aris countered. "Just... aggressive evolution."

#### Scene 3: The Failure

"Show them," Aris commanded Nautilus.

The construct projected a video log onto the wall. It was grainy security footage, time-stamped three months ago. The room on the screen was white, sterile, much like the one they were in. A man, labeled "Subject 104," was strapped to a chair. He looked terrified, sweating through his hospital gown. A robotic arm descended and injected him with the black serum.

The transformation was instant and horrifying. The man didn't glow gold like Angelica. He turned grey. His veins bulged, turning black as the virus surged through his system. He screamed, but the scream shifted, dropping an octave into a guttural roar that didn't sound human. It was the sound of vocal cords tearing and reforming.

His muscles spasmed, tearing his restraints. Bones audibly snapped and reformed, the sound amplifying through the speakers. His shoulders broadened, his fingers lengthened into claws.

"Watch the eyes," Aris whispered, leaning forward.

On the screen, the subject's eyes rolled back, then vanished. The sclera turned pitch black. The iris dissolved.

"He doesn't recognize the scientists anymore," Aris narrated. "He doesn't recognize himself. He only sees heat sources. Meat. He sees caloric potential."

The subject on the screen lunged at the camera, jaw unhinging slightly. A scientist in a hazmat suit tried to intervene with a taser. The subject didn't even flinch. He grabbed the scientist's arm and ripped it off with the casual ease of a child pulling a wing off a fly. The feed cut to static.

The room was silent. The only sound was the hum of the generator and Zephyr's shallow breathing.

"That was three months ago," Aris said. "Vane made thousands of doses. He stockpiled them in the lower levels, waiting for the right moment to 'uplift' the population. And when the Spire fell... the containment units cracked."

#### Scene 4: The Warning

*Scritch. Scritch.*

The sound came from the blast door again. It was louder this time, more insistent. It wasn't the wind. It was the sound of bone scraping against metal.

"I call them 'The Blighted'," Aris said casually, loading a syringe into a pneumatic dart gun. "They are attracted to heat. We are currently generating 98.6 degrees of thermal energy each, plus the generator. To them, we are a bonfire in the dark. We are the only warm thing in a cold world."

He looked at the door. The heavy steel was beginning to bulge slightly, a dent appearing in the center as if something incredibly strong was pushing against it.

"They are not zombies," Aris warned, turning to Ria. "Do not aim for the head. The brain is redundant. You have to sever the spine or burn the heart. They run on adrenaline overload. They will tear their own muscles to reach you. They don't feel pain. They don't feel fear. They only feel hunger."

"How many?" Ria asked, leveling her shotgun at the door. Her face was grim, her metal skin catching the orange light. She racked the slide.

Aris checked a sensor readout. "In this building? One. Outside? All of them. The fall woke them up."

He tapped the vial of black fluid, tucking it into his pocket.

"I tried to make gods," Aris said, his voice devoid of regret, only scientific curiosity. "I made ghouls. And I believe they are hungry."

*BOOM.*

Something slammed against the blast door with the force of a battering ram. The metal groaned. Dust fell from the ceiling. The hinges screamed in protest.

"Class is dismissed," Aris said, stepping back behind his console. "Prepare for field testing."
