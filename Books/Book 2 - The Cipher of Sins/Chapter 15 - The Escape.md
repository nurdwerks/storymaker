## Chapter 15: The Escape

### Scene 1: The Shot / Gallery, Museum of Pre-History

- **Key Event:** Hatcher acts as a sniper from a ventilation shaft, shooting the anti-gravity stabilizer of a massive chandelier directly above Prelate Vane.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — He demonstrates tactical wisdom by targeting a structural weakness to bypass Vane’s advanced nano-defenses rather than attempting a direct kill.

### Scene 2: The Crash / Gallery

- **Key Event:** The six-ton chandelier crashes, forcing Vane’s nano-swarm to focus on his personal defense and releasing Angelica; she hauls a dazed Zephyr toward the exit despite her own numerous injuries.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Amidst the chaos of a collapsing building and high-intensity combat, she remains focused on the mission and her team's survival over her own pain.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "Wake up, Zephyr, damn you! We're dead if we stay!"

### Scene 3: The Burn / Security Room

- **Key Event:** Lisbet channels a massive electrical current through her own neural link to fry the museum’s security grid and force the blast doors open.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She risks permanent neural damage and severe physical injury by acting as a living circuit to ensure the team's escape path is clear.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "GO! GO NOW!"

### Scene 4: The Run / Museum Bridge - Exit

- **Key Event:** Hatcher crashes his hover-car onto the museum's bridge to extract the team; as they escape, Vane watches them leave without pursuit, which Angelica recognizes as a sign of his calculated confidence.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes that Vane’s psychological victory is as dangerous as his physical one, as he now has her blood and knows her ultimate goals.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "He's already won the first round. And he wants us to know it."
