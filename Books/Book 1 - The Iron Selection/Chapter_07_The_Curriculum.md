## Chapter 7: The Curriculum

### Scene 1: The Lecture

- **Key Event:** In Lecture Hall 1, Professor Halloway (paper-thin skin, milky eyes, gold-threaded High Archivist robes) teaches the official history of the Great Ascension.

- **Key Event:** A hologram displays the "Founders" as divine beings chosen by Star-Gods, with Resonance as proof of divinity.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Professor Halloway:** "Resonance is their gift. It flows through the blood of the righteous. It is the proof of our divinity."

---

### Scene 2: The Correction

- **Key Event:** Angelica takes notes on logic errors: if Resonance is purity, why does it kill 40% during puberty? If it's a gift, why charge a blood price?

- **Key Event:** Angelica raises her hand and challenges the official story, citing that the "Founders" were actually flight crew with highest exposure to drive plume radiation.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's not divine selection, Professor. It's genetic compatibility with the focused radiation of the ship's engine core."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We aren't gods, Professor. We're just mutants with good PR."

### Scene 3: The Silence

- **Key Event:** Halloway calls it "Heresy." Squad Gold gasps; they view this as insulting God.

- **Key Event:** Kaelen Night watches with intense focus from two seats away. He knows she's right—House Night keeps secrets the Zenith forgets—but says nothing.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — Watches her burn, wondering if she'll turn to ash. Silence is safer.

---

### Scene 4: The Detention

- **Key Event:** Angelica is sent to the Hall of Penance—a soundproof room with padded walls—where she must hold a 20lb weighted iron rod at shoulder height until she admits she's wrong.

- **Key Event:** For three hours, Angelica endures burning muscles, spasms, and agony, but refuses to recant. Her Pride is harder than the iron.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Retreats into her mind, solving quadratic equations to distract from pain. Will not admit the lie.

- **Key Event:** When Halloway returns, the rod hasn't moved. He looks afraid, seeing unbreaking will in a "Silt-Rat."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen waits in the hallway afterward.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Was it worth the pain?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The truth implies that your gods are just batteries. I can see why you prefer the lie. It's much deeper. It's much safer."
