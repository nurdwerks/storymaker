## Chapter 26: The Engine

### Scene 1: The Install / The Gantry

- **Key Event:** The day has arrived.
- **Key Event:** The "Star-Tear Drive." The heart of the ship.
- **Key Event:** It hangs from the main crane, suspended by fifty chains.
- **Key Event:** It is ugly. A cylinder of patched titanium, wrapped in copper coils, glowing with the internal light of Vane's crystal.
- **Key Event:** It hums. A low, thrumming vibration that makes teeth ache.
- **Key Event:** "Steady!" Angelica yells into her megaphone. "Lower it slow! Millimeters!"
- **Key Event:** "It's heavy!" a winch-man shouts. "The gears are stripping!"
- **Key Event:** "Hold it!" Angelica screams. "If you drop it, you crack the planet! That core contains a singularity's worth of anger!"

### Scene 2: The Danger / The Shaft

- **Key Event:** _PING._
- **Key Event:** A chain snaps. The rust was too deep.
- **Key Event:** The engine swings. Five tons of unstable physics swinging like a pendulum.
- **Key Event:** It smashes into the scaffolding. Wood splinters. Men scream.
- **Key Event:** It swings back toward the delicate mounting bracket.
- **Key Event:** "Stop it!" Angelica yells.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar is there. He grabs a long iron pole.
- **Key Event:** He jams it between the engine and the wall.
- **Key Event:** He leans into it. His muscles bulge. Veins pop in his neck.
- **Key Event:** He is fighting gravity. He is fighting momentum.
- **Key Event:** "Guide it!" he roars.
- **Key Event:** The engine slows. It aligns with the bracket.
- **Key Event:** "Drop it now!" Ragnar bellows.
- **Key Event:** The winch-men release the brake.
- **Key Event:** _CLANG._
- **Key Event:** The engine settles into its mount. The ship shudders.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar drops the bent pole. He collapses, gasping.

### Scene 3: The Heat / The Engine Room

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Torin run into the engine room.
- **Key Event:** It is already hot. The air smells of ozone and hot metal.
- **Key Event:** The drive is pulsating.
- **Key Event:** Torin puts his hand near the casing. He pulls it back. "Hot."
- **Key Event:** "It feels like a sleeping dragon," he whispers.
- **Key Event:** Angelica checks the gauges. Needles are dancing in the red.
- **Key Event:** "It is," she says. "And we just woke it up."
- **Key Event:** She taps the glass. "Magnetic containment is at 98%. It's holding."

### Scene 4: The Heart / The Engine Room

- **Key Event:** She puts her ear to the hull.
- **Key Event:** She can hear it. _Thump-thump. Thump-thump._
- **Key Event:** "The heart is beating," she says.
- **Key Event:** She looks at Torin.
- **Key Event:** "We have an engine. But an engine is useless without gas."
- **Key Event:** "The fuel," Torin nods.
- **Key Event:** "We need the Magma," Angelica says. "We need to tap the volcano. That's the next step. Feeding the beast."

### Scene 5: The Melt / The Valve Junction

- **Key Event:** Suddenly, a hiss.
- **Key Event:** "Pressure spike!" Rylan, the Chief Engineer, shouts.
- **Key Event:** A valve seal blows. Superheated steam blasts out.
- **Key Event:** It's blocking the manual override.
- **Key Event:** "We're losing containment!" Angelica yells. "If pressure drops, the core implodes!"
- **Key Event:** Rylan doesn't hesitate.
- **Key Event:** He runs into the steam.
- **Key Event:** His skin blisters instantly. He screams.
- **Key Event:** But he grabs the wheel. He turns it.
- **Key Event:** _Creak. Creak._
- **Key Event:** The steam cuts off.
- **Key Event:** Rylan falls back. His legs are boiled red.
- **Key Event:** Angelica rushes to him.
- **Key Event:** "Rylan!"
- **Key Event:** He looks up at her. His eyes are glassy with shock.
- **Key Event:** "She... she held," he gasps. "Don't let... the pressure drop."
- **Key Event:** He passes out.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the valve. It is closed.
- **Key Event:** "Get a medic!" she screams. "And get a backup seal! We are not losing this ship! Not after this!"
