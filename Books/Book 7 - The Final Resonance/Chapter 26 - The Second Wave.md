## Chapter 26: The Second Wave

### Scene 1: The Sky Falls

- **Key Event:** The Entropy Fleet, a massive array of geometric black ships, launches its "Second Wave." These are not scouts or probes; they are "Erasers"—massive monoliths designed to wipe out the *Aeterna*'s hull integrity.
- **Detailed Description:** The viewscreen on the bridge is a wall of static and warnings. The Erasers descend like falling tombstones. They are rectangular prisms of absolute black, hundreds of meters long, rotating silently in the void. They do not fire lasers. They emit pulses of gravitational distortion that twist the ship's superstructure. The *Aeterna* shudders violently under the first volley. The sound is not an explosion; it is the screaming of metal being tortured. Bulkheads buckle. Air screams out of micro-fractures. The artificial gravity fluctuates, throwing the crew against the walls. The lights flicker and die, replaced by the strobing red of emergency power. The Erasers move with a terrifying, mathematical precision, positioning themselves to "delete" the ship sector by sector.
- **Internal Conflict:** On the bridge, Angelica watches the destruction with a calm that terrifies her. She realizes they have no shields left. No weapons that can hurt these things. They are fighting math with sticks. She looks at the tactical map, watching the red zones spread like an infection. She knows she has to ask someone to die. She knows who it has to be.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She turns to Zephyr. She doesn't give an order. She just looks at him. It is the hardest thing she has ever done. She is sending the rogue, the thief, the man who only cares about money, to his death. And she is doing it because she trusts him more than anyone else.

### Scene 2: The Suit Up

- **Key Event:** Zephyr heads to the launch bay. He suits up in the "Colossus" Mining Rig—a massive, industrial mech designed to crack asteroids, now repurposed for war.
- **Detailed Description:** The launch bay is a cavern of shadows and sparks. The Colossus stands in its cradle, a hulk of yellow industrial plating scarred by centuries of mining work. It smells of grease and old sweat. Zephyr climbs into the pilot's cage. He doesn't wear a sleek flight suit; he wears his worn leather duster over a pressurized under-suit. He checks his gear: his heavy blaster (useless against a ship, but comforting), his lucky coin, and his datapad. He connects his cybernetic arm to the mech's interface. The connection is raw and painful. The mech's systems flood his mind—reactor heat, hydraulic pressure, fuel levels. He becomes the machine. He flexes the mech's massive claw, and the hydraulics hiss in sympathy.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr's hands are shaking. He hides it by busying himself with the startup sequence. He is terrified. He has spent his whole life running away from fights he couldn't win. He has spent his whole life calculating the odds. The odds here are zero. But he keeps flipping the switches. He realizes that for the first time, the "profit" isn't money. It's the fact that Lisbet is still breathing. It's the fact that Angelica is still looking at him with that desperate hope.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — He looks at his reflection in the dark glass of the console. He sees an old man. A tired man. But not a poor man. He realizes he has enough "credit" in his soul to pay for this one last ride.

### Scene 3: The Farewell

- **Key Event:** Lisbet runs into the bay. She is carrying a heavy drive-stack—the override codes for the mech's safety limiters.
- **Detailed Description:** Lisbet looks small next to the massive landing gear of the mech. Her blue hair is matted with sweat. Her eyes are wide behind her goggles. She scrambles up the ladder to the cockpit. She doesn't look at Zephyr; she looks at the console, her fingers flying across the keys as she uploads the code. "I bypassed the governor," she says, her voice trembling. "It'll let you run the reactor at 300%. It... it will melt the core in ten minutes, but you'll have the speed." She finishes typing and finally looks at him. Tears are cutting tracks through the grease on her face.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet knows he isn't coming back. She can see it in his eyes. He has the "look"—the calm of a man who has already settled his tab. She wants to beg him to stay. She wants to hack the door so it won't open. But she knows that if he stays, they all die. She has to let her brother go so he can save her life.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a deck of holographic cards—Zephyr's lucky deck. She presses it into his hand. Her hands are sparking with static, but she doesn't care. She touches his organic hand, shocking him slightly, but neither of them flinches.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "You owe me, Scrap. You owe me big for this hack. Don't you dare die without paying me back."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Put it on my tab, Sparky. I'm good for it."

- **Key Event:** They share a moment of silence. It is a goodbye without the word. Lisbet jumps down from the cockpit. Zephyr watches her run to the blast shelter. He closes the canopy. The silence of the sealed cockpit is absolute.

### Scene 4: The Launch

- **Key Event:** The bay doors open. The vacuum of space rushes in, silent and cold.
- **Detailed Description:** The atmosphere vents in a cloud of crystals. The warning lights spin. The magnetic clamps release the mech with a heavy *thud*. Zephyr revs the fusion drill. The sound vibrates through the hull, a deep, angry growl. He pushes the throttle forward. The mech steps out into the void. It doesn't fly gracefully like a fighter; it charges like a bull. The thrusters flare blue-white.
- **Internal Conflict:** As he leaves the ship, Zephyr feels a strange sense of freedom. He is weightless. He is alone. The *Aeterna* is behind him, a fragile metal egg. The Erasers are ahead of him, black walls of death. He isn't a smuggler anymore. He isn't a thief. He is the wall between the monsters and his family.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Alright, Midas. Let's go make a withdrawal. One last job."
