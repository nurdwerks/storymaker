## Chapter 27: The Broadcast

### Scene 1: The Tower / Emergency Broadcast Station, Sector 4

- **Key Event:** The tower is a dinosaur. A relic from the pre-Zenith days.
- **Key Event:** It rises out of the smog like a rusted needle.
- **Key Event:** They kick down the door. Dust motes dance in the light.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet runs to the console. It’s covered in dials and switches. No touchscreens. No holograms.
- **Key Event:** "This thing runs on _vacuum tubes_," she whispers, running her fingers over the warm glass bulbs. "It's beautiful."
- **Key Event:** "Can you make it talk?" Angelica asks.
- **Key Event:** "I can make it scream," Lisbet says. "Give me five minutes."

### Scene 2: The Counter / Tower Control Room

- **Key Event:** Zephyr leans against the wall. He checks his wrist unit.
- **Key Event:** The debt counter. It’s been counting down with every mission. Every credit earned.
- **Key Event:** It beeps. **0.**
- **Key Event:** He stares at it. He’s free. He could walk away.
- **Key Event:** He unclasps the unit. He tosses it into a trash can.
- **Key Event:** "Counter's done," he says. "Debt's paid."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at him. "So you're leaving?"
- **Key Event:** Zephyr lights a match on his hook. He grins.
- **Key Event:** "Nah," he says. "Consider this overtime. Besides, I want to see Vane's face when you light the fuse."

### Scene 3: The Speech / Broadcast Tower

- **Key Event:** "We're live," Lisbet says. "Frequency open. All sectors. Even the Palace."
- **Key Event:** Angelica steps up to the microphone. It smells like old copper.
- **Key Event:** She takes a breath. She doesn't have a script. She has the truth.
- **Key Event:** "Citizens of the Zenith," she begins. Her voice crackles over every speaker on the ship. In the markets. In the barracks. In the throne room.
- **Key Event:** "They told you the Resonance was a gift. It's a leak. They told you the Stone Season was a trial. It was an eclipse. They told you we were chosen. We were cargo."
- **Key Event:** She pauses.
- **Key Event:** "Every lie they told is crumbling. The walls are falling down. And I'm the one with the sledgehammer."
- **Key Event:** "Wake up. Look up. The sky is real. And it belongs to you."

### Scene 4: The Payment / Tower Control Room

- **Key Event:** The transmission cuts.
- **Key Event:** The room is silent.
- **Key Event:** Angelica reaches into her pocket. She pulls out the golden cylinder casing she stole from the Archives.
- **Key Event:** She tosses it to Zephyr.
- **Key Event:** He catches it. He weighs it. Pure gold.
- **Key Event:** "Gold? Really?" he asks.
- **Key Event:** "It's all I have," Angelica says. "For the overtime."
- **Key Event:** Zephyr looks at the gold. Then he slips it into his pocket.
- **Key Event:** "It's enough," he says. "Let's get out of here before the Wardens trace the signal."

### Scene 5: The Response / Across the Zenith

- **Key Event:** In the Palace, a glass shatters.
- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane stands in front of the screen. His face is pale.
- **Key Event:** His perfect calm is gone. He is shaking.
- **Key Event:** "Find her," he whispers.
- **Key Event:** He turns to the High Command. "Burn Sector 4. Block by block. Silence that frequency."
- **Key Event:** "Sir?" a General asks. "That's civilian territory."
- **Key Event:** "There are no civilians," Vane screams. "Only believers and heretics! And she is the Greatest Heretic in History!"
- **Key Event:** He composes himself. He smooths his robes.
- **Key Event:** "Heresy, children, is the greatest sin of all. Cleanse it."
