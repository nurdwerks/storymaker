- **The Service:** He fetches Ironwood’s coffee and anticipates his orders with religious fervor, defending the General's reputation at any cost.
- **The Hostility:** He treats Angelica with open aggression, viewing her "magic" as a threat to the General’s command structure and a corruption of the military's purity.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 26: The Forging of Wrath](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2050-2070)
- **Defining Quote:** "Sensors show they are evacuating... Someone warned them." (Spoken in confusion, reveals flaw: ENVY/BLIND OBEDIENCE)
