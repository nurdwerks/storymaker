## Chapter 18: Aris's Experiment

### Scene 1: The Captive / Sector 4 Camp

- **Key Event:** The camp is quiet. Too quiet. Angelica is cleaning her rifle by the fire.
- **Key Event:** Then, a noise. A wet, rattling growl.
- **Key Event:** Ria draws her pistol. "Perimeter breach!"
- **Key Event:** Dr. Aris emerges from his tent. He is dragging a sled. On the sled is a cage made of scavenged laser-bars.
- **Key Event:** Inside the cage is a Blighted. It is humanoid, but twisted. Its skin is grey and translucent, revealing black veins. It snaps its jaws at the bars, drooling black ichor.
- **Key Event:** "Aris!" Angelica shouts, standing up. "What the hell is that?"
- **Key Event:** "Subject 4," Aris says, adjusting his glasses. "I captured it near the ventilation distinct. A former maintenance worker, judging by the uniform scraps."
- **Key Event:** Ria aims at the creature's head. "You brought a monster into our camp? Are you trying to get us killed, Doctor?"
- **Key Event:** "I am trying to learn!" Aris snaps. "We know nothing about their physiology. How do they track us? Do they sleep? Do they feel pain?"
- **Key Event:** He pokes the creature with an electrified prod. It shrieks.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You brought a monster into our camp? Are you trying to get us killed, Doctor?"

### Scene 2: The Observation / The Camp

- **Key Event:** Aris ignores them. He pulls out a frequency emitter.
- **Key Event:** He twists the dial. A low hum fills the air.
- **Key Event:** The Blighted stops thrashing. It freezes. It cocks its head, listening.
- **Key Event:** "Fascinating," Aris mutters into his recorder. "It reacts to 40 Hertz. The same frequency as the ship's main power conduit. They aren't hunting us by smell. They're hunting by _resonance_."
- **Key Event:** The creature's muscles bunch. It grabs the laser bars. Its skin sizzles and pops, but it doesn't let go.
- **Key Event:** "Doctor," Hatcher says, stepping forward. "It's getting agitated."
- **Key Event:** "Just a moment," Aris says, face pressed to the bars. "I need to measure the tensile strength output. The muscle density must be..."
- **Key Event:** _SNAP._
- **Key Event:** The laser-bar shorts out. The creature bends the metal.
- **Key Event:** "Oh," Aris says. "The bars broke."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Displays an unsettling clinical detachment, ignoring the creature's pain to measure its pulse.

### Scene 3: The Tragedy / The Camp

- **Key Event:** The creature lunges. Not at Aris. At the movement behind him.
- **Key Event:** **Pip**, a seven-year-old orphan who follows Lisbet around, had crept closer to see.
- **Key Event:** "Pip! Run!" Lisbet screams.
- **Key Event:** The creature is a blur of grey motion. It hits the boy.
- **Key Event:** There is no fight. Just a sickening crunch. The boy goes limp.
- **Key Event:** A gunshot rings out. Hatcher puts a slug through the creature's eye. It drops, twitching.
- **Key Event:** Silence falls. Lisbet runs to the boy. She wails.
- **Key Event:** Aris walks over. He checks the creature's corpse. Then he looks at the boy.
- **Key Event:** He opens his notebook. "Unfortunate variable. But the data confirms the muscle density is 300% of human norm. The child was... collateral damage to the experiment."
- **Key Event:** Angelica walks up to him. Her face is white with rage.
- **Key Event:** _SMACK._
- **Key Event:** She slaps the notebook out of his hand. It skids into the mud.
- **Key Event:** "You killed a child," she whispers. "You let it out. You played god and a boy is dead."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Unfortunate variable. But the data confirms the muscle density is 300% of human norm. The child was... collateral."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You killed a child. You let it out. You played god and a boy is dead."

### Scene 4: The Threat / The Camp

- **Key Event:** Ria marches forward. She puts her pistol to Aris's forehead. "Give me one reason not to paint the tent with your brains, Doc."
- **Key Event:** Aris doesn't flinch. He looks at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** "I know the codes," he says softly. "The Foundation Blast Doors. You can't open them without me. If I die, you all die in the dark."
- **Key Event:** Ria cocks the hammer. "I'll take my chances."
- **Key Event:** "Ria. Stand down," Angelica says.
- **Key Event:** "He killed the kid!" Ria shouts.
- **Key Event:** "I know," Angelica says. Her voice is dead. "But he's right. We need his brain."
- **Key Event:** She looks at Aris. "But if you ever—_ever_—endanger this crew again... I will give you to the Blighted myself. Piece by piece."
- **Key Event:** Aris picks up his notebook. He wipes the mud off. "A death is a tragedy, Miss Ward. Data is eternal. Which one saves the human race? Do the math."
- **Key Event:** He turns and walks back to his tent.
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches him go. She hates him. And she hates herself for letting him live.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Makes the pragmatic, "Vane-like" decision to value a monster’s utility over justice for a child.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Put him down, Ria. We need his brain."
