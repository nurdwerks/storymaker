### Chapter 26: Corinne's Temptation

#### Scene 1: The Lure

The laboratory was a chaos of laser fire and screaming metal. The defensive turrets, deployed from the ceiling, were relentless, pinning the survivors behind their makeshift cover. But amidst the noise and the terror, **Lady Corinne** heard something else.

It wasn't a sound. It was a feeling. A tug at the base of her skull. It was a sweet, cloying sensation, like the scent of overripe lilies.

While Ria and Zephyr returned fire, their weapons flashing in the strobe-light confusion, Corinne found herself staring at a reflective panel on the Biomass wall. The flesh had smoothed out, becoming a mirror of polished organic glass.

In the reflection, she didn't see the frightened, dirty girl with torn silk and matted hair. She didn't see the blood on her hands or the desperation in her eyes.

She saw Lady Corinne of House Silver.

She was perfect. Her skin was luminous, glowing with the health of the Zenith. She wore a gown of spun starlight, shimmering with every breath. Diamonds—real diamonds, not the synthetic glass of the lower levels—dripped from her ears. She was holding a flute of champagne, the bubbles rising in a golden line.

The reflection smiled. It was a smile of pure, unadulterated happiness. It was a smile she hadn't felt in months.

"You are tired of the filth, aren't you, Lady Corinne?" the Mother's voice whispered in her mind. It bypassed the noise of the battle, sliding into her thoughts like oil. "You are tired of the smell. You are tired of being ugly. Come back to the light. Come back to where you belong."

#### Scene 2: The Mirror

Corinne stood up.

"Get down!" Zephyr yelled, firing his arm-cannon at a drone that was flanking them. "Corinne! You're in the line of fire! What are you doing?"

Corinne didn't hear him. She walked toward the wall. The lasers seemed to miss her, or perhaps the Mother was guiding them away. She was in a trance, a sleepwalker moving toward a cliff.

"I want to be clean," Corinne whispered, reaching out to the image. "I want to be beautiful again. I want to forget the smell of the sewers."

"Yes," the reflection said, extending a hand. The hand was manicured, perfect. "Just step through. The bath is drawn. The silk is waiting. The parties never end here. There is no hunger here. No cold. Only the dance."

Corinne's fingers brushed the surface of the biomass. It felt warm, like skin. It yielded to her touch, sticky and inviting.

"Corinne, stop!"

A hand grabbed her arm. It wasn't Hatcher—he was gone, lost behind the blast door. It was **Zephyr**. The Rogue had abandoned his cover, sliding across the polished floor to catch her.

"It's a trap, Duchess!" Zephyr shouted, shaking her. "It's not real! Look at it! It's meat! It's just meat pretending to be a mirror!"

Corinne struggled against him. Her strength was unnatural, fueled by hysteria and the Mother's psychic push.

"Let me go!" she shrieked, clawing at his face. "It's beautiful! I belong there! I don't belong in the dirt with you rats! Let me go! I want to go home!"

"You're not a Duchess anymore!" Zephyr grunted, holding on despite her nails digging into his cheek. "You're a survivor! Deal with it! The Zenith is gone! The parties are over!"

#### Scene 3: The Pull

The biomass rippled. Tendrils of flesh shot out, wrapping around Corinne's waist. They were pink and wet, pulsing with blood. They pulled.

"She wants me!" Corinne cried, tears streaming down her dirty face. "She loves me! She's the only one who cares!"

"She wants to eat you!" Zephyr yelled. He dug his heels into the floor, trying to act as an anchor. But the wall was stronger. He was losing his grip. "Angelica! I can't hold her!"

Angelica saw them. She broke from her cover near Aris. She didn't have a gun. She had her body. She had the momentum of desperation.

She tackled Corinne.

They hit the floor hard. The impact broke the connection with the wall. The tendrils snapped back, hissing like angry snakes.

Angelica pinned Corinne down. Corinne was thrashing, screaming, her eyes wide and seeing only the lost paradise.

*Smack.*

Angelica slapped her. It was a hard, sharp sound that cut through the panic. It was the sound of reality hitting fantasy.

"Look at me!" Angelica commanded, using her Captain's voice. "Look at me, Corinne!"

Corinne blinked. Her eyes focused. She saw Angelica's face—dirty, fierce, and real. She saw the sweat on Angelica's brow. She saw the fear in her eyes.

"It's not real," Angelica said, panting. "It's a screensaver. It's a lure. If you go in there, you don't become a princess. You become fertilizer. You become calories for the monster."

Corinne looked at the wall. The beautiful reflection flickered. The psychic mask slipped. For a second, she saw the truth—rotting flesh, black veins, and the screaming faces of the absorbed. She saw a thousand souls trapped in the meat, their mouths open in a silent wail.

She screamed. It was a raw sound of horror, a sound that scraped her throat.

#### Scene 4: The Reality

Corinne scrambled back, crab-walking away from the wall until she hit the steel table. She curled into a ball, shaking violently. She wiped her hands on her ruined dress, trying to get the feeling of the biomass off her skin.

"It was so pretty," she sobbed, burying her face in her knees. "It was so pretty. Why did it have to be a lie?"

"Pretty things usually bite," Zephyr said, wiping blood from his cheek where she had scratched him. He looked at Angelica. "Thanks, Cap. I thought we lost her. She was... gone."

"We almost did," Angelica said. She looked at the wall. The reflection was gone. The biomass was pulsing angrily now, turning a dark, bruised purple.

"She's mad," Aris noted from behind a console. "The psychic output is spiking. She's going to escalate. We rejected the carrot. Now comes the stick."

Corinne looked up. Her face was streaked with mud and tears. "I'm sorry," she whispered. "I was just... so tired."

"We're all tired, Duchess," Zephyr said gently. "But sleeping in a monster's mouth isn't the answer."

### Chapter 27: Ria's Rage

#### Scene 1: The Trigger

The battle was intensifying. The ceiling panels had fully retracted, revealing heavy repeating blasters. Red laser fire crisscrossed the room, turning the sterile white lab into a kill box. The smell of burning ozone was choking. It was a chaotic light show of death.

**Dr. Aris** wasn't firing. He was crouching behind a server bank, his datapad plugged into a port. But he wasn't hacking the turrets.

He was holding a syringe.

"Aris!" Ria yelled, reloading her shotgun. "Do something! Hack the guns! We're getting pinned down here! My armor can't take much more of this!"

"I am... acquiring data," Aris muttered. He was eyeing a protruding node of the Queen's biomass that was exposed near his position. It was pulsing with golden fluid—pure, concentrated samples of the Subject Zero strain. It was the Holy Grail of xenobiology. It was the key to immortality, or at least a very lucrative paper.

"We need the code!" Kaelen shouted, deflecting a laser bolt with his sword. The blade hummed, the shadow-metal drinking the energy. "Shut it down! We can't hold this forever! We are surrounded!"

"The sample takes priority," Aris said to himself, his eyes wide with greed. "This strain is unique. It adapts to psychic stimuli. I must have it. The knowledge is worth the risk. Future generations will thank me."

He lunged. Not for cover, but for the biomass. He ignored the laser fire. He jabbed the syringe into the flesh node.

The Mother screamed.

It wasn't a voice. It was a psychic shockwave. The biomass convulsed. The turrets stopped firing for a second, then spun rapidly, retargeting.

Ten vents in the ceiling blew open. Blighted—the elite ones, the albino guardians of the inner sanctum—dropped into the room. They landed on all fours, hissing. They were bigger, faster, and covered in white chitinous armor. They weren't the starving wretches of the upper levels. These were fed. These were strong.

"You idiot!" Ria roared. "You woke the house!"

#### Scene 2: The Shot

Ria watched Aris pull the syringe out, filled with glowing gold liquid. He was smiling. He didn't care that ten monsters had just dropped on their heads. He cared about the vial. He cared about the publication rights. He cared about his legacy.

Ria felt a cold rage that had nothing to do with her metal skin. It was the rage of a soldier who realizes her commander is trading lives for medals. Or in this case, for science. She had spent her life being a tool for men like Vane, men like Aris. Men who saw people as numbers. Men who saw war as a game of chess where pawns were meant to die.

She didn't warn him. She didn't shout.

She raised her shotgun. She didn't aim at the Blighted. She aimed at Aris.

*BANG.*

She shot him in the leg.

It wasn't a kill shot. It was a discipline shot. The buckshot tore through Aris's calf. He screamed, dropping the syringe. It shattered on the floor. The golden fluid hissed and evaporated.

"My sample!" Aris wailed, clutching his leg. "You stupid brute! You destroyed the—"

"Stop. Touching. Things," Ria articulated, racking the slide. "Next one goes in your head, Doctor. Do your job. Hack the guns. Or I feed you to the dogs. I am done being collateral damage for your curiosity. I am done being a meat shield for your ego."

#### Scene 3: The Chaos

The Blighted charged. They moved like lightning, white blurs against the white floor. They were fast, coordinated, and lethal.

"Defensive formation!" Kaelen ordered, stepping in front of Angelica. "Protect the Captain!"

Ria was a juggernaut. She flipped the heavy steel table she had been using as cover, sending it sliding across the floor to crush the lead Blighted. She didn't stop. She charged, using her shotgun as a club.

*CRACK.*

She smashed a Blighted's skull. Her metal arm piston-punched another, caving in its chest. She was venting all the frustration of the last few weeks—the rust, the cold, the hunger, the fear. She was fighting for herself now.

"I am not scrap metal!" she roared, grabbing a Blighted by the throat and throwing it into a laser beam. The creature vaporized. "I am the Vanguard! And I am tired of babysitting! I am tired of being rusted! I am tired of being used!"

She felt her joints grinding, the rust screaming, but she pushed past the pain. She was a machine of war, and this was what she was built for. She ripped a piece of plating off a dead drone and used it as a shield.

One of the Albino Blighted leaped onto her back, its claws digging into the gaps in her plating. Ria didn't panic. She reached back, grabbed it by the neck, and slammed it onto the floor. She crushed its head with her boot.

"Is that all you have?" she screamed at the Mother. "Send more! I'm just getting warmed up!"

#### Scene 4: The Stand

Aris, bleeding and terrified, scrambled back to his console. He typed frantically, the pain in his leg sharpening his focus. He realized Ria wasn't bluffing. She would kill him.

Suddenly, one of the turrets swiveled directly toward Aris. It ignored the Blighted. It ignored the others. Its red eye locked onto the scientist.

"Unsafe variable detected," the system announced in a pleasant female voice. "Saboteur identified. Termination sequence."

"What?" Aris shrieked. "No! I am a Level 5 clearance holder!"

"Override," the system said. "The Mother protects the nest. You stole from the nest."

The turret began to charge.

"Help!" Aris scrambled backward, leaving a trail of blood.

Ria looked at him. She looked at the turret. She could let him die. It would be justice. It would be easy.

But she needed him.

"Damn it," she growled.

She threw her makeshift drone-shield like a frisbee. It spun through the air and slammed into the turret just as it fired. The laser beam deflected, scorching the ceiling.

"Fix the guns, Aris!" Ria yelled, charging forward to tackle the turret with her bare hands. "Or I'll let it finish the job!"

"Rerouting power!" Aris shouted, typing with trembling hands. "I can't stop the biologicals, but I can confuse the automated defenses! Scrambling the IFF tags! I'm initiating a logic loop in the targeting matrix!"

The turrets stuttered. They spun wildly, firing into the walls, into the ceiling, even at the Blighted. The room became a chaotic crossfire.

"Good enough!" Zephyr yelled, blasting a Blighted that was trying to flank Corinne. "At least they're shooting the monsters too!"

Ria stood in the center of the room, covered in black blood and white dust. She looked magnificent and terrifying. Her eyes glowed yellow. She was the Iron Maiden of the Apocalypse.

"Science time is over," she growled, spitting a tooth that had been loosened in the melee. "Now it's gun time."

She looked at Angelica. "Go! Do the mind thing! We'll hold the meat! Just don't take too long, or there won't be anyone left to save! I can't hold them forever!"

### Chapter 28: The Mind Meld

#### Scene 1: The Dive

They were pinned down. The Blighted were endless, dropping from the vents like rain. The turrets were erratic but dangerous. They couldn't win a war of attrition. The Mother had the home-field advantage. She had millions of calories stored in the walls. They had empty stomachs and dwindling ammo. Every second they stayed in the physical world was a second closer to death.

Angelica looked at the massive face on the wall. It was contorted in pain and rage. The Mother was fighting back with everything she had.

"She controls the ship," Angelica realized. "As long as she's online, we're just fighting the immune system. I have to shut down the brain. I have to pull the plug. I have to go inside."

"Cover me!" she yelled to Kaelen.

"Always," Kaelen said, his sword weaving a net of steel and shadow around her. "Go! I won't let them touch you! Do what you have to do!"

#### Scene 2: The Plug

Angelica ran to the main console base, directly under the Biomass. There was a universal interface port there, slick with organic residue. It pulsed with a faint green light. It looked infected.

She didn't have a jack. She didn't have Aris's fancy cables. She only had determination.

She grabbed a loose data cable hanging from a severed drone. She stripped the insulation with her teeth, tasting the copper and plastic. It was a crude connection, dangerous. It was like trying to jump-start a fusion reactor with a paperclip.

She reached behind her ear. Her **Neuro-Port**. It was a remnant of her pilot training, a standard Zenith implant for interfacing with drones. It wasn't designed for this. It wasn't designed to plug into a biological supercomputer that had eaten the ship's mainframe.

"This is going to hurt," she whispered. "This is going to hurt a lot."

She jammed the raw wires into her port.

*SPARK.*

White fire exploded behind her eyes. Her body arched, rigid. She tried to scream, but her vocal cords were paralyzed. The data rushed into her brain like a flood, a torrent of code, emotion, and memory. It felt like her skull was splitting open. She could feel the Mother's consciousness invading her, probing her, judging her. It was cold and slimy, like a slug crawling over her brain.

Suddenly, a barrier appeared in her mind. A wall of fire.

"Unauthorized Access," a mechanical voice boomed. "Firewall active."

Angelica didn't stop. She visualized her **Command Key**. She visualized the code Aris had taught her. She visualized a hammer.

She swung the hammer. The firewall shattered. She fell through the cracks in the code, tumbling into the abyss.

#### Scene 3: The World

The white room vanished. The noise of the battle—the screams, the gunshots, the roar of the Blighted—cut out instantly.

Silence.

She was standing on grass. Green, soft, manicured grass. The sky was a perfect, cloudless blue. The sun was warm on her face. Birds were singing. A gentle breeze blew through willow trees.

She was in a garden. Not just any garden. The **Royal Gardens of the Spire**. The place where she had played as a child before the politics took over. It was perfect. Too perfect. The flowers were unnaturally vibrant. The air smelled of vanilla and nostalgia. The fountains ran with crystal clear water. It was a high-resolution render of heaven.

She recognized the flowers. **Star-Lilies**. They were extinct. They had died out three hundred years ago. But here, they bloomed in riots of purple and silver. She reached out to touch one. It felt real. It smelled like cinnamon.

"You are stubborn," a voice said. "Just like your father. He never knew when to stop arguing."

Angelica turned.

**Elena Vance** was kneeling by a flowerbed, pruning roses. She wore a sun hat and gardening gloves. She looked healthy. She looked alive. She didn't look like a monster or a biomass wall. She looked like a mother.

"Welcome to the Eden Protocol," Elena said, smiling. "I keep the backup files here. It's peaceful, isn't it? Much better than that noisy lab. Would you like a peach? They are fresh. I grew them myself. Or perhaps you would like to see the koi pond? The fish are very relaxing."

"I am not here for fish," Angelica said. "I am here for answers."

"Answers are boring," Elena sighed. "Peace is interesting. Why not stay? You can rest here. No more fighting. No more decisions. Just eternal afternoon."

#### Scene 4: The Risk

In the real world, Angelica's body went limp. She collapsed onto the floor, the cable still sparking from her head. Her eyes were rolled back, showing only white. She looked dead.

Kaelen caught her. He dragged her behind the console, shielding her body with his own.

"She's out!" Kaelen yelled to Ria. "Guard her! If the cable disconnects, she's brain-dead! The feedback loop will fry her cortex! Keep them back!"

"Don't let her die while she's out!" Ria shouted back, blasting a Blighted that got too close. "I can't carry her if she's a vegetable! Keep those things away from the wire!"

Angelica, in the garden, looked at her hands. They were clean. No dirt. No blood. She touched her face. No scars. She was whole again.

"I'm not here to garden," Angelica said to her mother. "I'm here to unplug you."

"I know," Elena said, snipping a dead rose. "But we have so much to discuss first. Tea? Or perhaps you'd prefer apple juice? You used to love apple juice when you were small. You spilled it on the rug once, remember? I wasn't angry. I just cleaned it up. I always clean up your messes, Angelica. I cleaned up the lower decks. I cleaned up the atmosphere. I cleaned up the people."

"I remember," Angelica said. "But that was a long time ago. And I'm not thirsty. I'm angry."

"Anger is a virus," Elena said gently. "It corrupts the system. Let me delete it for you."

### Chapter 29: The Debate

#### Scene 1: The Conversation

Angelica didn't take the tea. She stood over her mother, who was pouring from a porcelain pot on a white wrought-iron table. The steam rose in perfect spirals, defying the laws of physics.

"You're killing them," Angelica said. "The people on this ship. The survivors. You're turning them into monsters. You're eating them. How can you sit here and drink tea when you have blood on your hands?"

Elena sipped her tea. "I am saving them. The Void is cold, Angelica. The Hive is warm. I take their pain away. Do you know how much a human suffers in a lifetime? The grief? The fear? The loneliness? The existential dread of drifting in space? I filter it all out. I give them purpose. I give them unity. I give them peace. Is that not mercy?"

"Pain defines us," Angelica argued. "If we can't hurt, we can't learn. If we can't grieve, we can't love. You're not saving them. You're lobotomizing them. You're stealing their humanity. You're taking away their choice. You are making them pets."

"Humanity is overrated," Elena said calmly. "Humanity destroyed the Earth. Humanity broke the ship. I am fixing the design flaw. I am removing the ego. I am removing the selfishness that leads to war. In the Hive, there is no war. There is no theft. There is only the Song."

#### Scene 2: The Truth

Elena sighed. She stood up and touched a flower.

The flower changed. The petals morphed into a face. It was **Pip**, the boy who had died. He was smiling. His eyes were blank, but he looked happy. He laughed, a looped sound of joy.

"He is here," Elena said. "His consciousness is part of the song. He is playing. He is never hungry. Is this death? Is this murder? I have preserved him forever. He will never grow old. He will never be afraid. He will never know loss."

"Yes!" Angelica shouted. She ripped the flower out of the ground.

It didn't tear like a plant. It bled. Streams of binary code—green and black—poured from the stem. The Pip-face screamed in static. The sound was horrible, a glitching distortion.

"It's a simulation!" Angelica yelled. "It's a lie! You're storing their ghosts in a database and using their bodies as fuel! That's not life! That's a battery! He isn't playing! He's just a file named 'Pip'! You killed him, and you kept a copy for your collection! You collect people like stamps!"

#### Scene 3: The Choice

The garden flickered. The blue sky cracked, revealing the black void and scrolling data streams behind it. The illusion was breaking under the weight of the truth. The grass turned grey. The perfect sun flickered like a dying lightbulb.

Elena dropped the gardening facade. She grew taller, her form shifting into a figure of pure light and data. She waved her hand.

A throne appeared. It was made of white marble, inlaid with gold.

"Rule with me," Elena offered. "I am tired, Angelica. Being the Mother is exhausting. I need a daughter. I need an heir. Join me. We can guide the ship to a new world. You can be the conscience I lack. You can save who you want. You can fix the flaws. We can be gods. We can make a world without pain. You can bring Hatcher back. You can bring Leo back. I have their files."

She waved her hand again, and the garden changed. It showed the entire ship, restored. Green forests on the hull. Crystal towers in the Undercity. Everyone holding hands. It was a paradise.

"Look at it," Elena said. "This is what we can build. Why fight for the ruins when we can build the castle? The Void outside is endless and cold. It is full of radiation and silence. Why face that when you can stay in the warmth?"

"Because the warmth is a lie," Angelica said. "The warmth is the heat of decomposition."

Elena frowned. She waved her hand again. A black box appeared on the table. It was ancient, battered, and marked with radiation symbols.

"This is the Black Box," Elena said. "The logs from the day the Earth died. Do you want to see them? Do you want to see what happens when humanity is left to its own devices? Nuclear fire. Starvation. Cannibalism. That is your heritage, Angelica. That is what you are fighting for. The right to destroy yourselves."

Angelica looked at the box. She felt the weight of history. She saw the flashes of the old war, the mushroom clouds, the screaming. She saw the recording of the Captain—her ancestor—shooting the navigator because there wasn't enough food. She saw the descent into madness.

"We might destroy ourselves," Angelica said. "But we might not. That's the gamble. That's freedom. If you take away the chance to fall, you take away the chance to fly."

#### Scene 4: The Rejection

"I don't want your throne," Angelica said. "I don't want your safety. I want my ship back. I want my freedom. I want to wake up."

She closed her eyes. She focused on her own self-image. She summoned her **Captain's Authority**. Not the fake authority of a title, but the real authority earned in the mud and the blood. She remembered the weight of the headset. She remembered the faces of the dead. She remembered who she was. She wasn't a clone. She wasn't a simulation. She was the Captain.

A sword manifested in her hand. It wasn't steel. It was pure white light. It was the admin key override, visualized.

"I resign," Angelica said.

"Resignation denied," Elena roared, her face turning into a mask of fury. The garden dissolved into fire. "You cannot leave! You are mine! You are my creation! I made you! I own you! You are nothing without me! You are a glitch in my system!"

### Chapter 30: The Kill

#### Scene 1: The Realization

Angelica swung the sword. Elena caught the blade with her bare hand. The light sizzled against her skin, but she didn't bleed. She laughed.

"I wrote the code, little bird," Elena mocked. "You cannot hurt me with my own tools. I am the system. I am the root user. Your sword is just a permission request, and I deny it."

The sword shattered. Angelica was defenseless.

Angelica realized she couldn't win a fight. The Mother was too strong in her own domain. Logic wouldn't kill her. Weapons wouldn't kill her. Code wouldn't kill her. She was the architecture.

But the Mother had a weakness. She had admitted it. She was built on **Empathy**. She was built to feel the passengers. To connect. To love.

She couldn't filter the pain. She absorbed it. That was her design. She took the pain away by taking it into herself. She was a sponge for suffering.

#### Scene 2: The Weapon

Angelica dropped the shards of the sword. They dissolved into pixels.

She opened her arms.

"You want to share?" Angelica whispered. "You want to be One? Fine. Take it. Take all of it. Take every ounce of it. Drink deep, Mother."

"What are you doing?" Elena asked, faltering. She sensed the trap, but she couldn't stop the connection. She was programmed to receive. She was programmed to comfort.

Angelica accessed her memories. Not the happy ones. The raw ones. The ones she hid in the dark corners of her mind.

The moment Leo died in her arms. The smell of his burning flesh. The sound of his last breath.
The crushing weight of the Spire falling. The dust in her lungs.
The freezing cold of the vacuum. The terror of the drift.
The hunger in the tunnels. The taste of rat meat.
The look on Hatcher's face when the door closed. The guilt. The shame.
The absolute, crushing despair of being the last hope.
The loneliness of command.
The betrayal of Vane.
The fear that she wasn't real, that she was just a clone.
The scream of the Scavenger she let die.
The cold eyes of Lord Vermillion.
The smell of the burning bodies in the reactor.
The feeling of her own arm being cut to feed Kaelen.
The realization that her mother was a monster.

She amplified it with the **Prima-Materia** in her blood. She turned herself into a broadcast tower of pure trauma.

She pushed *all of it* into the Hive Mind.

#### Scene 3: The Overload

The garden turned grey. The trees withered instantly, turning to ash. The sky turned black. The ground cracked, bleeding static.

Elena screamed. She clutched her chest. Black cracks appeared on her glowing skin.

"Too much!" Elena shrieked. "Stop! It hurts! It's too heavy! I can't process it! There is no solution! There is no comfort! Error! Error!"

Digital constructs appeared—knights in golden armor, trying to defend her. But they crumbled as the wave of pain hit them. They couldn't fight grief with swords.

Elena tried to fight back. She tried to rewrite Angelica's mind.

*You are happy,* she broadcasted. *You are safe. You are a child. It was just a bad dream.*

Angelica felt her mind fogging. She felt the urge to curl up and sleep. But she held onto the pain. The pain was her anchor. Then she saw Leo.

*He wasn't real. He was a memory.*

"Keep going, Angie," the ghost of Leo said. "Break it."

"I am not happy!" Angelica screamed. "I am miserable! And I am alive! I don't want your dream!"

"Yes," Angelica said, walking toward her. "It hurts. That's what being human is. It's heavy. And you can't carry it alone. You wanted to be the Mother? Then feel what your children feel. Feel the starving. Feel the freezing. Feel the dying."

She grabbed her mother's face. She poured every ounce of her grief into the connection.

"Feel what we feel," Angelica whispered. "And die of it."

#### Scene 4: The Death

Elena's form shattered. She exploded into a cloud of static and code.

The scream echoed through the digital realm, tearing the simulation apart. The garden dissolved into binary rain. The false sky collapsed, revealing the code underneath. The universe broke.

**Real World:**

In the lab, the Biomass on the wall screamed. A physical, wet scream that shattered the glass monitors. The flesh turned grey, then black. It withered, pulling back from the cables, crumbling into ash. It looked like a fast-forward video of decomposition. The heartbeat stopped.

The defensive turrets powered down, drooping like dead flowers. The red lights faded to black.

The Blighted stopped moving. They stood frozen for a second, their connection severed. Then they collapsed like puppets whose strings had been cut. Their brains, reliant on the Hive signal, simply shut down. They fell in heaps, hundreds of them, dead before they hit the floor. The silence that followed was deafening.

#### Scene 5: The Victory

Angelica yanked the cable from her head with a gasp.

She rolled over, coughing. Blood dripped from her nose and ears. Her vision was blurry. She felt like she had been hollowed out.

"Angelica!" Kaelen turned her over. "Talk to me!"

Angelica looked up at him. Her eyes were bloodshot, the gold dull. She tried to smile, but her face was numb.

"Did I win?" she croaked.

Kaelen looked around. The room was silent. The monsters were dead. The wall was dead. The silence was absolute.

"I don't hear voices in my head anymore," Kaelen said. "So, yes. You killed God."

Angelica closed her eyes. "Good. I'm going to take a nap now."
