# Character Profile: "Little" Timmy

**Archetype:** The Protector / The Unthinking Wall
**True Sin:** WRATH (His protection is unthinking and absolute, easily turned into physical aggression).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (He frames his blocking and intimidation as "Respect for Elders").

## I. Role in the Story

"Little" Timmy is a massive, simple-minded orderly at the retirement home who adores Joyce and acts as her "unofficial" bodyguard.

- **The Barrier:** He physically blocks Angelica’s path, crossing his arms and saying, "Miss Joyce is resting. Go away."
- **The Devotion:** His unthinking loyalty to the "harmless grandmother" version of Joyce makes Angelica feel like a villain for even trying to speak to her own grandmother.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Honorable Sacrifice / Maiming. During an assassination attempt on Joyce, Timmy takes a bullet (or energy blast) meant for her. He survives, but he is permanently paralyzed, losing the physical strength that was his only defining trait.
- **Impact on Joyce:** Joyce feels a deep, agonizing guilt. She realizes that her "secret" life has destroyed the life of a simple, innocent man who only wanted to protect her. She becomes more ruthless in her pursuit of the Zenith, viewing it as "justice" for Timmy.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Wall" is broken. The retirement home no longer feels safe. The other residents lose their protector and become increasingly dependent on "Nurse" Ratched's clinical authority for their safety.

## III. Book 4 Integration

- **Location:** Book 4, Chapter 22
- **Scene:** "The Sacrifice" (Paralyzed protecting Joyce)
- **Role:** The Unbreakable Wall
- **Quote:** "Legs... don't work. Did I stop them, Miss Joyce?"

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "...She's gone. Timmy! Secure the hallway!" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Key Event | The mob breaches the facility. "Little" Timmy defends Joyce. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | The hallway becomes a kill zone. Scavengers pour in, smashing furniture and looting. Timmy, the massive orderly, stands in front of Joyce like a shield. He uses a heavy oak table as a weapon, sweeping attackers aside. But he is overwhelmed. A scavenger with a laser cutter slices through his leg. Timmy falls but refuses to move, covering Joyce with his body. He takes blow after blow, his eyes locked on Joyce, waiting for her command. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Detailed Description | Joyce snaps. The "Grandmother" persona evaporates completely. She pulls the knitting needles from her hair. **Needle**, her Phase-Viper bond, manifests around her arm. She moves into the mob. It is not a fight; it is a slaughter. She moves faster than the eye can follow, her needles phasing through armor and bone. She strikes with surgical precision—carotid, femoral, ocular. In seconds, ten men are dead. She stands over Timmy, breathing hard, her cardigan splattered with blood. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce looks at Timmy. He is dying. His sacrifice has bought her time, but it has broken her heart. She touches his face, her bloody hand trembling—not from age, but from grief. |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Timmy (wheezing):** "Did I stop them, Miss Joyce? Did I do good?" |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | Dialog | **Joyce:** "Yes, Timmy. You were the best boy. You were the cushion." |
| Book 4 | Chapter 22 | *Internal Conflict | Joyce is broken. She has lost her home, her friend Gable, her protector Timmy, and her illusion of peace. She is just a killer in the dark again. She looks at her hands, still stained with blood, and weeps silently. |
| Book 6 | Chapter 47 | *Internal Conflict | She sees faces that remind her of the friends she lost. A mechanic who looks like Timmy. A gunner who has Hatcher's eyes. She realizes that the crew is her family now. She is fighting for them, not just for the abstract concept of "Humanity." |
