### Scene 1: The Scavenging Mission (Baron Gilded's Penthouse)

- **Key Event:** Zephyr leads a scavenging mission into the frozen upper sectors, targeting the abandoned penthouse of Baron Gilded.
- **Detailed Description:** The upper sectors of the Zenith are a tomb of crystal and ice. What was once the pinnacle of luxury is now a frozen mausoleum. The temperature is forty degrees below zero. Zephyr, Ria, and Angelica move through the corridors wrapped in layers of scavenged thermal insulation. Their breath mists in the air, instantly freezing into crystals on their facemasks. The penthouse door, a slab of reinforced mahogany and gold filigree, is breached by Ria using a pry-bar and brute force. Inside, the opulence is untouched by the chaos below. Silk tapestries hang stiff with frost. The floor is a sheet of black ice reflecting the flashlight beams.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr fights a war between his old instincts and his new reality. His cyber-eye scans the room, automatically appraising the value of the crystal vases and gold-leaf furniture—millions of credits worth of loot. But his stomach cramps with hunger, reminding him that in this new world, a can of beans is worth more than a diamond. He also has a specific shopping list: **General Ironwood** needs mobility. Zephyr is looking for servos, heavy-duty pistons, or anything that can replace the General's lost legs.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Look at this place. Millions in art on the walls, and I bet he didn't have a single can of peaches. Or a spare pair of legs for the General."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Check the pantry. Ignore the shiny stuff. Ironwood is tough, he can wait."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "He can't patrol from a chair, Ria. I promised him I'd find some wheels."
- **Key Event:** The group navigates the traps left by Gilded's paranoia.
- **Detailed Description:** As they move deeper into the penthouse, Zephyr's cyber-eye highlights tripwires made of monofilament and pressure plates hidden under the rugs. Gilded protected his hoard even from the grave. Zephyr disarms them, salvaging a servo-motor from a hidden turret.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Jackpot. High-torque servo. This'll lift a tank. Ironwood's gonna love it."
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica watches Zephyr work, realizing how much of his "criminal" skill set is actually high-level engineering. She feels a pang of guilt for dismissing him as just a thief in the past. He is literally building their General back together.

### Scene 2: The Throne Room (The Statue of Greed)

- **Key Event:** Zephyr finds Baron Gilded's frozen corpse, still seated in his crashed Repulsor Throne.
- **Detailed Description:** In the center of the main atrium, beneath a shattered skylight that lets in the snow, sits Baron Gilded. He is frozen solid. The repulsor throne failed when the power died, dropping him to the floor with a bone-shattering impact, but he never left the seat. He is wearing his full ceremonial regalia—gold-threaded velvet, rings on every finger. His face is a mask of blue ice, mouth open in a silent scream. The cold has preserved him perfectly, turning him into a literal statue of greed.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr stands before his former master. For years, he terrified of this man. Now, Gilded is just meat. Zephyr feels a hollow, cold satisfaction. The debt is cancelled not by payment, but by entropy.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Feels no pity, only satisfaction. He rips out Gilded's diamond-studded gold tooth as payment for old debts.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "You look good in blue, Baron. Matches your soul."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Remember when you threatened to take my arm? I'm taking your smile instead."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "That's disgusting. He's a corpse."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "That's business. He owed me."

- **Key Event:** Zephyr uses his knife to pry the tooth loose.
- **Detailed Description:** The sound of metal grating on frozen bone echoes in the silent room. Zephyr works with surgical precision, popping the heavy gold implant free. He holds it up to the light, inspecting the diamond inset. It glitters coldly. He pockets it, not because he can spend it, but because it proves he won.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — This act symbolizes his total emancipation from the fear that ruled his life.

### Scene 3: The Vault (The Real Treasure)

- **Key Event:** The group finds Gilded's emergency stash behind a false wall in the bedroom.
- **Detailed Description:** The vault is not filled with money, but with survival. Floor-to-ceiling shelves are stocked with military-grade ration bars, self-heating soup cans, water purification tablets, and thermal blankets. There are medical kits and boxes of power cells. It is a prepper's paradise. The sight of it—the sheer abundance—is overwhelming to the starving survivors.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a surge of rage. This one man hoarded enough supplies to keep the entire Undercity orphanage alive for a year. He died sitting on top of it rather than sharing a single crumb. It solidifies her resolve that the old world _deserved_ to burn.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He had enough here to save a hundred people. He saved none."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "He died hungry anyway. Irony has a sick sense of humor."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He had enough here to save a hundred people. He saved none."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "He died hungry anyway. Irony has a sick sense of humor."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Grab everything. We leave nothing for the rats."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** (Already organizing cans by expiration date) "Tuna... 2099. Peaches... 2101. Excellent vintage. Zephyr, dear, do be careful with those power cells. Use the padded bag."

- **Key Event:** Loading the supplies.
- **Detailed Description:** They fill their packs to the bursting point. Zephyr prioritizes the high-calorie nutrient paste and the power cells for his arm. Ria takes the water filters. Angelica loads the medical supplies. They work in silence, driven by the primal need to secure the resources.

### Scene 4: The Descent (The Viral Gauntlet)

- **Key Event:** On the way back down through the frozen corridors, the group encounters a pack of starving Virals.
- **Detailed Description:** The Virals have adapted to the cold. Their skin is pale blue, their movements jerky and twitchy. They ambush the group in a narrow stairwell. They are skeletal, driven by a hunger even deeper than the survivors'. They don't scream; they hiss.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria switches instantly to combat mode. Her fear vanishes, replaced by the cold calculation of a soldier. She takes point, her cybernetic arm locking into a combat configuration.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Her combat instincts save the mission. She uses a heavy flashlight as a club, smashing the lead Viral backward down the stairs to create space.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Contact! Front!"

- **Key Event:** The skirmish in the stairwell.
- **Detailed Description:** The fight is brutal and close-quarters. Zephyr fires his hold-out blaster, the blue bolts illuminating the dark stairwell. Angelica uses a shock-baton to defend the rear. They lose two of the unnamed scavengers—dragged into the shadows by the pack—but they manage to push through the door to the secure lower levels.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr feels the loss of the scavengers. In the old days, he wouldn't have cared—they were just overhead. Now, he feels the weight of every lost life. He checks his ammo count, realizing every shot costs power he can't easily replace.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Door! Get the door!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We got the food. The dead don't eat anyway. Keep moving."

- **Key Event:** Returning to the camp.
- **Detailed Description:** They stumble back into the survivor camp, exhausted and covered in frost and alien gore. But they drop the packs, and the sound of heavy cans hitting the floor is the most beautiful sound in the world. The survivors gather around, eyes wide at the bounty.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She distributes the food herself, ensuring equal portions, contrasting directly with Gilded's hoarding.

### Scene 5: The Architect's Sin

- **Key Event:** Blame assigned.
- **Detailed Description:** As Angelica oversees the food distribution, Dr. Aris approaches with a data-slate. He has analyzed the pathogen's genetic markers and confirms what they suspected: the virus was engineered. Not by alien hands, but by human ones. The biosignature matches classified records from the Zenith's bioweapon program. The architect of this nightmare, the creator of the Blight that turned civilized beings into ravening monsters, was **Prelate Vane**. He designed this horror years ago as a failsafe—a way to purge the population if they ever threatened his control.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Vane. It's always Vane. He doesn't just rule us—he engineered ways to murder us wholesale."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "A contingency plan. Elegant, in its way. Horrifying, but elegant."
