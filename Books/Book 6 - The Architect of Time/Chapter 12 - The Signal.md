## Chapter 12: The Signal

### Scene 1: The Radio

- **Key Event:** The Setting.
- **Detailed Description:** The jagged peak of the mountain overlooks the entire valley. The wind here is constant, a howling gale that strips the warmth from the skin. The sky is a bruised purple. Angelica Ward sits cross-legged on the bare stone. Her flight suit is patched with local furs. Her hands are raw, blistered, and bleeding from days of climbing and scavenging.
- **Key Event:** The Machine.
- **Detailed Description:** In front of her sits a monstrosity of engineering improvisation. A "spark-gap transmitter." It is built from the cannibalized servos of her crash suit, strips of copper wiring ripped from the escape pod's console, and a series of crude batteries made from hollowed-out gourds filled with citric acid from local fruit and zinc shards. It looks like garbage. It is the most advanced piece of technology on the planet.
- **Key Event:** The Transmission.
- **Detailed Description:** Ideally, she would have a subspace transceiver. Reality gives her two wires and a spark. She taps the makeshift key. _Dit-dit-dah._ A spark jumps the gap, blue and angry, accompanied by a sharp _snap_.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering) "S... O... S..."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "This is Flight Officer Angelica Ward. _Aeterna_ Survivor. Identifying Beacon Alpha-9. Please respond."

- **Key Event:** The Repetition.
- **Detailed Description:** She repeats the sequence. Again. And again. Her finger taps the rhythm of distress. The sparks flash like tiny lightning bolts, sending radio waves out into the void.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ She imagines the waves traveling out, pushing through the clouds, reaching orbit. Someone has to be listening. The automated buoys. The deep-space relays. Someone.

### Scene 2: The Static

- **Key Event:** The Listening.
- **Detailed Description:** She puts on the headset—two cracked speakers held together with vines and pressed against her ears. She closes her eyes. She tunes out the wind. She listens for a reply.
- **Key Event:** The Expectation vs. Reality.
- **Detailed Description:** She expects a crisp digital handshake. A beacon ping. A friendly voice saying, "We read you, Ward. Hang tight."
- **Key Event:** The Noise.
- **Detailed Description:** Instead, she hears the universe screaming. _Hiss. Pop. Whine._ It is a wall of white noise. Cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang. The scream of the local sun. The atmospheric electrical discharges of a chaotic, young world. For a microsecond, the static on the tiny screen resolves into a face—Lisbet's face, screaming a silent warning—before dissolving back into snow.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I saw you. I know you're there. Just hang on. I'm coming back for all of you."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Come on. Cut through it. Just one ping."

- **Key Event:** The Diagnosis.
- **Detailed Description:** There is no pattern. No logic. Just chaos. She checks the frequency dial. It's clear. The transmitter is putting out power.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Why isn't it getting out? She looks up at the sky. The aurora borealis is shimmering even in the daylight.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The ionosphere. It's too thick. The solar radiation is bouncing everything back. It's a mirror."

- **Key Event:** The Desperation.
- **Detailed Description:** She cranks the power dial. The acid in the gourd batteries bubbles and hisses. Smoke rises from the copper wires.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Screaming into the mic) "Can anyone hear me?! This is Angelica Ward! I am alive! Answer me!"

### Scene 3: The Isolation

- **Key Event:** The Passage of Time.
- **Detailed Description:** Three days pass on the mountain top. The sun rises and sets. Rain lashes her. She doesn't move. She doesn't eat. She drinks rainwater from a hollow in the rock. She just taps. _Dit-dit-dah._ Her finger goes numb. Then it bleeds. Then it callouses.
- **Key Event:** The Night Sky.
- **Detailed Description:** On the third night, the clouds break. The moon rises. It looks huge—closer, brighter, and more cratered than she remembers. Then she looks at the stars.
- **Key Event:** The Realization.
- **Detailed Description:** The constellations are wrong. Orion is twisted. The North Star is missing. The galactic plane is tilted.

  - _character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — The realization hits her like a physical blow to the stomach. It’s not just the ionosphere. It’s the time.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Even if the signal got out... who would hear it? The Zenith won't exist for five thousand years. Her brother wasn't born yet. Her friends, her enemies, the entire civilization she knows—they are dust. Or rather, they are unborn potential.

- **Key Event:** The Loneliness.
- **Detailed Description:** A profound loneliness settles over her. It is heavier than gravity. It crushes her lungs.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I am sending messages to ghosts. I am calling a number that hasn't been connected yet."
  - _Internal Monologue:_ She is the only human being on Earth who knows what a radio is. She is the only one who knows math. Who knows poetry. Who knows what a symphony sounds like. She is an anachronism. A singularity.

- **Key Event:** The Stakes.
- **Detailed Description:** She realizes the fragility of her position. If she dies here, human history ends before it begins. Or at least, her history. The knowledge she carries dies with her.

### Scene 4: The Acceptance

- **Key Event:** The Break.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up. Her legs are stiff. She looks at the transmitter one last time. It sits there, buzzing faintly. It is a crutch. It is a plea for help that will never come. It is false hope.
- **Key Event:** The Destruction.
- **Detailed Description:** She kicks it. It is a violent, angry kick. The machine flies apart. It clatters over the edge of the cliff, tumbling down into the mist. It smashes into pieces on the rocks below. Silence returns to the mountain.
- **Key Event:** The Resolution.
- **Detailed Description:** She breathes. The wind sounds different now. It is no longer an enemy; it is just wind.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. Just me. Okay. Fine."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I don't need a rescue. I'll save myself."

- **Key Event:** The Vow.
- **Detailed Description:** She wipes the dirt and dried blood from her face. She stares down at the jungle—the green hell that wants to eat her. She stares up at the indifferent stars.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "If you won't come for me, I'll come for you. I'll build a door, and I'll kick it down! You hear me? I am not dying on this rock!"

- **Key Event:** The Descent.
- **Detailed Description:** She turns her back on the sky. She starts the climb down. She moves with purpose. She isn't a victim anymore. She isn't a survivor. She is the Architect. And she has work to do.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Time to get to work. First, shelter. Then, civilization."
