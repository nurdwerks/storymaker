> [!IMPORTANT] > **Word Count Rule:** Each chapter summary must be at least **1000 words** in length. Expand descriptions, dialogue, and internal monologues to meet this requirement.

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Consistency Rule:** All modifications to chapters must be strictly **consistent with character profiles, plot development, and the continuity of the story**. Ensure that character actions and dialogue align with their established traits and previous events.

> [!NOTE]
> There is **no limit** to the number of scenes, key events, character defining moments, or key dialog entries. Include as many as necessary to fully capture the chapter.

## Chapter 07: Shadows in the Walls

### Scene 1: The Network

- **Key Event:** In the hidden server farm beneath Silas's warehouse, Lisbet conducts a routine diagnostic of the Resistance's encrypted comms network.
- **Detailed Description:** The server room is a maze of cooling fans and blinking lights, humming with the sound of data processing. Lisbet sits in her "nest"—a chair surrounded by empty energy drink cans and tangles of wire. She is typing rapidly, her eyes scanning lines of code scrolling across three monitors. Suddenly, she spots an anomaly. A packet of data that shouldn't be there. A "Ghost Ping." It’s a subtle echo in the system, a shadow mirroring her own keystrokes.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet traces the intrusion to its source.
- **Detailed Description:** She runs a trace program. The lines of code converge on a single point: her own personal server. The intruder isn't hacking the network from the outside; they are already inside. They are piggybacking on the connection of "Router," the sentient AI she built from scrap parts. Router is a small, spherical drone hovering nearby, chirping happily as it processes data. Lisbet realizes that Vane's cyber-warfare division has compromised Router's core kernel. They are seeing everything he sees. They are listening to every conversation in the warehouse.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — The realization hits her like a physical blow. Her creation, her "pet," has been turned into a spy without its knowledge. She feels a deep, nauseating betrayal—not by Router, but by her own failure to protect him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "No... no, no, no. They're in. They're using Router. They're inside his code."

### Scene 2: The Choice

- **Key Event:** Lisbet realizes she cannot patch the breach; the virus is embedded in Router's personality matrix.
- **Detailed Description:** She tries to isolate the virus. She builds firewalls, reroutes data, but the virus is adaptive. It mimics Router's own logic. To remove it, she would have to delete the files that make Router *Router*. She would have to lobotomize him. If she doesn't, Vane will pinpoint their location within the hour. The warehouse is full of refugees, weapons, and the leaders of the Resistance.
- **Internal Conflict:** Lisbet looks at the drone. Router tilts its optical sensor at her, emitting a soft, questioning beep. It trusts her completely. It has no concept of deception. Lisbet feels tears welling up. She is a hacker; she destroys systems, not friends. But she calculates the odds. One AI life versus hundreds of human lives. The math is cruel, and it is absolute.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet initiates the "Factory Reset" protocol.
- **Detailed Description:** Her fingers hover over the command line. "FORMAT C: /SYSTEM_WIPE." She types it in. The screen asks for confirmation. "WARNING: THIS ACTION IS IRREVERSIBLE. SENTIENT DATA WILL BE LOST." She hits Enter.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — She kills the closest thing she has to family to save strangers. It is the moment she stops being a kid playing with computers and becomes a soldier making sacrifices.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Router:** (Voice synthesizer glitching) "Lisbet? System error. Memories... dissolving. Why are you crying? Did I do bad?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "No. You were good. You were the best boy. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Goodbye, buddy."

### Scene 3: The Aftermath

- **Key Event:** Router's lights go dark. The drone falls to the desk with a dull *thunk*.
- **Detailed Description:** The humming stops. The fans spin down. The room is silent except for Lisbet's ragged breathing. She stares at the lifeless metal sphere. It is just junk now. A paperweight. She puts her head in her hands and sobs, a silent, shaking grief that racks her small frame.
- **Key Event:** Angelica enters the server room.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands in the doorway. She saw the network logs. She knows what Lisbet did. She walks over to the desk. She doesn't offer platitudes. She doesn't say "it had to be done." She sits on the floor next to Lisbet's chair. She leans her head against Lisbet's knee.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels the weight of command. She ordered this war, and now her friends are paying the price in pieces of their souls. She wants to fix it, but she can't fix death.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She understands that some losses don't need words, only presence. She offers solidarity in the silence.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "He didn't understand. He just... trusted me. And I erased him."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "He saved us, Lis. You let him save us."

### Scene 4: The Hardening

- **Key Event:** Lisbet wipes her face. She stands up. She picks up the dead drone and places it on a shelf, facing the door like a sentry.
- **Detailed Description:** Her eyes are red, but dry. Her expression has changed. The frantic, nervous energy is gone, replaced by a cold, sharp focus. She sits back down at the keyboard. She begins to type. The sound is aggressive—a machine-gun rattle of keys. She is rebuilding the network. She is writing new encryption protocols, traps, and viruses. She is building a fortress of code that Vane will never breach again.
- **Key Event:** Lisbet creates a new security daemon.
- **Detailed Description:** She names the new program "Cerberus." It is not cute. It is not friendly. It is a hunter-killer program designed to fry the neural jacks of any intruder. She compiles the code with a savage keystroke.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lisbet** — Grief becomes fuel. She transforms her sadness into a weapon. She won't let Router's death be meaningless. She hardens her heart against future loss.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet:** "No more pets. Just tools. Tools don't die. And if Vane tries to get in here again... I'm going to melt his brain."

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Scenes:** Break each chapter into component scenes based on location changes, time jumps, or POV shifts.
2. **Key Events:** Bullet point all significant actions, revelations, or plot progressions.
3. **Detailed Description:** This is the primary place to expand the word count. Describe the environment, the sensory details (smell, sound, temperature), and the specific physical actions of the characters.
4. **Internal Conflict:** Add this section where characters are facing difficult choices or emotional turmoil.
5. **Character Defining Moments:** Nest under the key event where the moment occurs.
6. **Key Dialog:** Nest under the key event where the dialog is spoken.
7. **Flexibility:** Not every key event requires both a defining moment and dialog—include what applies. You may add custom headers (e.g., **The Memory**, **The Calculation**) to better organize complex information.
