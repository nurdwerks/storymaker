# Character Profile: Joyce (The Needle)

**Archetype:** The Sleeper Agent / The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing / The Grandmother
**True Sin:** WRATH (A cold, dissociated capability for extreme violence. It is not the hot, emotional rage of Kaelen or Ironwood; it is the professional, surgical removal of obstacles. She kills without pulse elevation).
**Virtue Mask:** KINDNESS (She projects the ultimate non-threat: the frailty of age, the warmth of a hearth, the offering of food. She weaponizes the Zenith's dismissal of the elderly).

## I. Physiognomy & Appearance: The Harmless Facade

Joyce is designed to be looked at and immediately dismissed. In a society obsessed with youth and perfection (Corinne, Grey), Joyce embraces the invisibility of decay.

### 1. The Frail Shell

- **Stature:** She is tiny, barely 5'0", shrinking with age as osteoporosis (accelerated by Resonance exposure) curves her spine. She moves with a shuffling, uncertain gait, leaning heavily on a walker or furniture. This clumsiness is entirely feigned; when active, she moves with the silence and speed of a spider.

- **The Face:** A landscape of wrinkles. Her skin is soft, powdery, and hangs loose on her jaw. She has kind, watery blue eyes magnified by thick spectacles. She often looks confused, blinking rapidly as if trying to recall where she is—a mixture of acting and the genuine side-effects of her Sacrifice.

- **The Hands:** To the casual observer, they are gnarled by arthritis, shaking slightly as she holds a teacup. To the trained eye (like Hatcher’s), the calluses are in the wrong places for a knitter—they are on the trigger finger and the palm-heel. Her grip strength is terrifying. When the tremor stops, her hands are steady enough to thread a needle or slit a carotid artery in the dark.

### 2. The Scent of Deception

Joyce creates an olfactory camouflage. She smells intensely of **Lavender**, **Peppermint**, and **Baking Powder**.

- **The Purpose:** This "Old Lady Smell" triggers a subconscious relaxation response in targets. More importantly, the strong essential oils mask the chemical scents of her trade: gun oil, cyanide (bitter almonds), and the ozone tang of her Resonance Bond.

### 3. The Blankness (Physiological Toll)

Because her Bond consumes **Memory**, Joyce often has a "reboot" look. Her face goes completely slack for a second as she loses a chunk of her past to pay for a kill. It looks like a petit mal seizure or a senior moment, but it is actually a lobotomy in real-time.

## II. Sartorial Style & Accessories

Joyce dresses in "Cardigan Camouflage." Her wardrobe is aggressively non-threatening, utilizing soft fabrics and pastels to disarm paranoia.

- **The Knitwear:** She is never without a cardigan, usually hand-knitted in soft pinks, blues, or creams. The wool is thick—thick enough to hide the Kevlar weave underneath. The loose sleeves hide spring-loaded holsters.

- **The Handbag:** A massive, bottomless floral carpet-bag.

  - _Contents:_ Hard candies (some poisonous), a Bible (hollowed out for comms gear), a thermos of tea (spiked), and spare ammunition wrapped in handkerchiefs to stop them from clinking.

- **The Spectacles:** Thick, bottle-bottom glasses on a beaded chain. They are actually a **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** linked to her Bond, highlighting thermal signatures and targeting solutions. When she peers over them "confusedly," she is actually calibrating a kill-shot.

- **The Knitting Needles:** Her signature weapons. They appear to be standard steel needles. In reality, they are **Null-Iron** stilettos, sharpened to a mono-molecular point. They can pierce Zenith body armor. She knits constantly to keep them in hand without raising suspicion.

## III. Mannerisms, Ticks, and Psychological Quirks

Joyce operates on a dual frequency: The Grandmother and The Asset.

- **The Tea Ritual:** "Have a cup of tea, dear. You look cold." Offering food or drink is her primary infiltration tactic. It establishes a social contract (Guest Right) that makes the target lower their guard. It is also her delivery system for sedatives and toxins.

- **Feigned Deafness:** She constantly asks people to repeat themselves or speaks slightly too loudly. "What was that, dear?" This forces people to lean in close (entering her kill zone) and makes them underestimate her intelligence. She hears everything.

- **The "Click":** When she drops the mask, there is a physical transformation. The tremor stops. The stoop vanishes. Her voice drops an octave, losing the quaver. She goes from 80 years old to ageless predator in a nanosecond. Hatcher calls this "The Click."

- **The Humming:** She hums nursery rhymes while she works (cleaning weapons or mixing poisons). It is a mnemonic device to help her retain her remaining memories.

## IV. The Bond: Needle and The Memory Toll

Joyce’s magic is the ultimate trade-off: Skill for Self.

- **The Beast:** **Needle** (The Phase-Viper).

  - **Appearance:** Needle is a small, translucent serpent, no longer than a forearm. It looks like it is made of glass and smoke. It usually stays coiled inside Joyce’s sewing basket or wrapped invisibly around her wrist.
  - **Personality:** Cold, efficient, and silent. It does not speak; it only indicates targets.

- **The Mechanics:**

  - **Covert Manifestation:** **Phasing**. Needle can turn objects (like Joyce’s knitting needles or bullets) intangible for a split second, allowing them to bypass armor or walls before re-solidifying inside the target.
  - **Overt Manifestation:** **The Strike**. Needle launches itself as a projectile, passing through flesh to stop a heart without breaking the skin.

- **The Sacrifice:** **Memory.**
  - _The Cost:_ To make matter intangible, Joyce must give up "matter" from her mind. Every use of the bond erases a specific memory. A small lockpick might cost her what she had for breakfast. A kill-shot might cost her the memory of her wedding day.
  - _The Horror:_ She is a tabula rasa. She knows she loves **Corinne**, but she cannot remember Corinne’s mother (her own daughter). She has killed the memory of her family to protect the only member left. She keeps a physical journal, but she often forgets how to read her own handwriting.

## V. Backstory & Pre-Narrative Life

**The Spy:** Joyce was once a high-ranking operative for the Zenith Intelligence Directorate. She was the handler for **Lady Vesper**. She specialized in "Quiet Removals."

**The Daughter:** Joyce had a daughter, Maura (Corinne’s mother). Maura was political, loud, and dangerous. She threatened the status quo. The Directorate ordered her removal. Joyce tried to save her, but failed (or perhaps, in a memory she burned to save Corinne, she was the one forced to do it).

**The Retirement:** Joyce took custody of the infant Corinne and "retired" to **Coopers Chase**, a facility for burned spies. She raised Corinne with a terrified, obsessive need to keep her useless. "Be the cushion, not the nail." She shaped Corinne into a vapid socialite to ensure Corinne would never be a target.

**The Inciting Incident (Book 2):** **Lady Vesper** activates Joyce. Vesper wants to destabilize the Emperor by killing the "Sangreal" (Angelica). Joyce’s deep-cover programming kicks in. She doesn't want to kill Angelica, but she has no choice. The programming is woven into the memories she has left.

## VI. Narrative Arc & Character Growth

### Book 2: The Cipher of Sins — **_The Trap_**

- **State:** Joyce is living at Coopers Chase. She befriends Angelica, Hatcher, and Zephyr when they hide there. She knits socks for Zephyr.
- **The Turn:** The activation phrase is sent. Joyce prepares the **Bitter Almond Tea**.
- **The Interaction:** She hands Angelica the cup. "Drink, dear. It will settle your nerves." Her hand does not shake.
- **The Break:** Angelica smells the cyanide. She realizes the betrayal. Angelica uses the **Imperial Voice** (Command Voice). "JOYCE. SIT."
- **The Result:** The Command Voice clashes with Vesper’s programming. Joyce seizes. The programming shatters. Joyce wakes up, horrified. She realizes Vesper tried to make her kill a guest.
- **The Shift:** Joyce pledges loyalty to Angelica, recognizing her as the True Authority. She becomes the group's protector, turning her lethal skills against the Seekers.

### Book 3: The Game of Gears — **_The Shadow in the Court_**

- **State:** Joyce infiltrates the Palace disguised as a servant/grandmother visiting Corinne.
- **The Role:** She acts as the counter-intelligence officer. She spots Vesper’s spies and neutralizes them.
- **The Interaction with Corinne:** Corinne discovers Joyce cleaning blood off a stiletto. The illusion of the "Silly Grandmother" breaks.
  - _Corinne:_ "You killed him."
  - _Joyce:_ "He was going to poison your wine. Eat your vegetables, darling."
- **The Tragedy:** Joyce begins to lose critical memories. She forgets Zephyr’s name. She forgets where she is sleeping. The stress of the mission is eating her mind.

### Book 4: The Stone Season — **_The Final Guard_**

- **State:** In the apocalypse, Joyce is fragile. The cold hurts her bones. Without her medication, her mind slips into dementia.
- **The Decline:** She confuses Angelica with her dead daughter. She wanders off. Hatcher and Ria have to watch her.
- **The Climax:** The **Cannibal Gang** attacks the camp while the heavy hitters (Ria, Kaelen) are away foraging. They corner Corinne.
- **The Sacrifice:** Joyce experiences a moment of crystal clarity. She sees her granddaughter in danger. She summons **Needle** for a massive, room-clearing Phase Strike.
  - _The Cost:_ Total Wipe. To power the strike, she burns everything. Her name, her past, language, self.
  - \*The Act:\*\* She kills six attackers in two seconds, phasing her knitting needles through their armor.
  - \*The Death:\*\* She does not die from a wound. She dies because her brain empties. She collapses, breathing but vacant. She looks at Corinne and smiles, but there is no recognition behind the eyes. She dies holding Corinne’s hand, having forgotten who she is holding, only knowing that she is safe.

### Book 5 & Onward — **_The Legacy_**

- **The Needles:** Corinne takes Joyce’s needles. She wears them in her hair.
- **The Lesson:** Corinne stops playing the victim. She realizes her grandmother wasn't "silly"; she was playing a role to survive. Corinne adopts this strength. "I am the needle now."

## VII. Relational Deep Dives

### 1. With Corinne (The Gardner and the Flower)

- **The Dynamic:** _Protector and Protected._
- **Complexity:** Joyce loved Corinne so much she deliberately made her weak. She pruned Corinne’s ambition to keep her safe.
- **The Guilt:** Joyce carries the guilt of the daughter she couldn't save. She projects that onto Corinne.
- **The End:** In her final moments, Joyce forgets the guilt. She only feels the love. Corinne realizes that every vapid party she attended was bought with Joyce’s memories.

### 2. With Angelica (The Commander)

- **The Dynamic:** _The Soldier and the General._
- **The Shift:** After Angelica breaks the programming, Joyce views her with religious awe. Angelica is the "Captain" she was waiting for.
- **The Utility:** Angelica uses Joyce. She sends the old woman on scouting missions. Angelica feels guilty about this (using an old woman as a weapon), mirroring Vane’s utilitarianism.

### 3. With Hatcher (The Professionals)

- **The Dynamic:** _Game Recognizes Game._
- **The Interaction:** They sit on the porch at Coopers Chase. Hatcher cleans his gun; Joyce knits. They don't speak, but they understand each other. They are both killers trying to retire.
- **The Respect:** Hatcher is the only one who notices when Joyce is slipping (memory loss). He covers for her. He gently reminds her of things she forgot without shaming her.

### 4. With Lady Vesper (The Handler)

- **The Dynamic:** _Hatred._
- **The Conflict:** Vesper treats Joyce like a remote-control drone. Vesper assumes Joyce is too broken to rebel.
- **The Revenge:** In Book 3, Joyce slips a non-lethal paralytic into Vesper’s tea during a gala. As Vesper chokes, Joyce leans in and whispers, "I remember _some_ things, dear."

## VIII. Key Quotes & Internal Monologues

- _"Old age is the perfect disguise. No one looks at a withered hand and sees a weapon. They see a victim. And victims are dangerous because they have nothing to lose."_ (Book 2)
- _"I don't remember my husband’s face. I don't remember the color of my first house. But I remember how to break a trachea. Isn't that sad?"_ (To Hatcher, Book 2)
- _"Drink your tea, Angelica. The world is ending, but that is no excuse for bad manners."_ (Book 4)
- _"Who are you? You look like someone I loved."_ (Last words to Corinne).

### 4. The Sewing Circle

Joyce masks her lethality with the persona of a harmless grandmother. Her "friends" are fellow elderly citizens who seem benign but are often complicit in her cover, or simply provide a world of comfort that Angelica cannot access.

- **Mrs. Gable:** A sweet-faced old woman who knits alongside Joyce. They gossip about "the youngsters" and share tea. When Angelica enters, Mrs. Gable clutches her purse and looks at Joyce with wide, fearful eyes, prompting Joyce to "protect" her friend from the "scary silt-girl." It emphasizes Angelica as a monster disrupting peace.
- **Mr. Henderson:** A retired clockmaker who plays chess with Joyce in the park. They have a long-standing rivalry and flirtation. He brings Joyce flowers and ignores Angelica completely. The gentle, domestic normalcy of their relationship is a sharp contrast to the violence of Angelica’s life.
- **"Little" Timmy:** Not a child, but a massive, simple-minded orderly at the retirement home who adores Joyce. He carries her heavy bags and glares at anyone who looks at her wrong. He blocks Angelica’s path, crossing his arms and saying, "Miss Joyce is resting. Go away."
- **Nurse Ratched (The Handler):** A severe, professional nurse who administers Joyce’s "medication" (combat stims). She treats Joyce with professional respect and Angelica with bureaucratic disdain. She often scolds Angelica for "upsetting the residents" and chases her out of Joyce’s room.
