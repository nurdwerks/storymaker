# Character Profile: Fence "Sly"

**Archetype:** The Underworld Merchant / The Cheat
**True Sin:** GREED (He views every person as having a price and every story as having a profit margin).
**Virtue Mask:** HONESTY (He claims his cruelty is just "Being Real about Business").

## I. Role in the Story

"Sly" is a shady dealer who buys Zephyr’s stolen goods. He represents the parasitic nature of the Underworld's economy.

- **The Dehumanization:** He asks if Angelica is "for sale." When told no, he tells her to "move," because she's "blocking the light" on the merchandise.
- **The Ego:** He laughs at Zephyr’s jokes and calls him a "legend," helping to build a bubble of vanity around Zephyr that Angelica cannot penetrate.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Financial Betrayal / Exile. **Location:** Book 3, Chapter 6 ("The Backroom Deal"). Sly refuses to buy Zephyr's stolen goods, terrified of Vane's new "Protocol Silence." He exiles Zephyr from the Black Market to save his own skin.
  **Quote:** _"The Market is closed, Zephyr."_
- **Impact on Zephyr:** Zephyr is forced to distance himself from Sly to protect his own reputation. The loss of his most reliable fence cuts off Zephyr’s primary source of information and income, forcing him into riskier, more desperate jobs.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Market" is closed. The ring loses its ability to turn stolen Zenith goods into liquid credits, turning the Smuggler’s Ring into a group of "hoarders" who are trapped with valuable but unsellable contraband.

| Book 3 | Chapter 06 | Detailed Description | Zephyr meets with "Sly," a fence who operates out of a noodle stand near the loading docks. Zephyr is nervous. He looks over his shoulder. The keys he stole from the Museum are hot. He needs credits to buy his way off the ship (or so he thinks). |
| Book 3 | Chapter 06 | Key Event | Sly rejects the deal. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 06 | Detailed Description | Sly pushes the data-chip back. He looks terrified. He tells Zephyr that Vane has put a "Black Bounty" on anyone connected to the Museum heist. Not a capture bounty—a kill order. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 06 | Dialog | **Sly:** "I can't be seen with you. The Market is closed, Zephyr. For good. Anyone who talks to you is dead. Vane isn't arresting people anymore; he's erasing them." |
