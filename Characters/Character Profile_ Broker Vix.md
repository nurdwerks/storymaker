## I. Role in the Story

Broker Vix is a high-speed information trader who whispers secrets directly into Baron Gilded’s ear. They operate in a frantic, coded language of stocks, bonds, and debts.

- **The Dynamic:** They share a deep, exclusionary intimacy with Gilded, their heads bent together as they laugh at the misfortune of those they’ve bankrupted.
- **The Stings:** Their effortless connection and shared jargon make Angelica feel profoundly alone, reminding her that she is an outsider to the true power structures of Sector 4.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 10: The Gala of Ghosts](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L838-854)
- **Defining Quote:** "Information is a commodity, Vix. And your data has become corrupted." (Reveals flaw: GREED)

## Consistency Check

| Book | Chapter | Type | Event Description |

| Book 2 | Chapter 28 | Dialog | **Baron Gilded (to his broker):** "Triple our positions on reconstruction. War is just urban renewal with extra steps. The blood dries, the credits flow." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | The side chamber is darker, the air thick with smoke. Here, the real power brokers of the Zenith gather. Angelica leans against a pillar, trying to be invisible. A woman approaches her—Broker Vix. Vix is small, unassuming, dressed in the neutral tones of a clerk. But her eyes are sharp. She is Baron Gilded's information dealer, a woman who knows every secret on the ship. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Key Event | Vix offers Angelica information. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Detailed Description | Vix stands next to Angelica, not looking at her. She speaks into her wine glass. She offers details on Vane's troop movements—information that could save the Resistance. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | *Internal Conflict | Angelica is suspicious. Information is never free in the Zenith. She wonders what Vix's angle is. Is she a double agent? Or just a mercenary hedging her bets? |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Moment | **Broker Vix** — She reveals her lack of loyalty to her current master. She is a true survivor, willing to sell out the powerful to ensure her own future. |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Broker Vix:** "Gilded thinks he owns me. He rents me. And I'm always taking new clients. Vane is moving troops to Sector 4 tonight. A purge." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 16 | Dialog | **Broker Vix:** "Survival. When you tear this place down—and you will, I've seen the math—I want safe passage. I want a seat on the lifeboat." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 27 | Detailed Description | **Matriarch Lilith Night** stands on a catwalk overlooking the armory, watching the chaos. She is not dirty. She is pristine in black silk. She watches her son, Kaelen, drilling a squad of recruits. She does not intervene, but she taps a message to her financial broker on her wrist-comp: "Liquidate the armaments stock. The value is about to peak." |
| Book 3 | Chapter 30 | Dialog | **Baron Gilded (to his broker):** "The Palace falls. Buy everything adjacent. Water rights, power grid shares, reconstruction contracts. When Ward plants her flag, we'll own the ground she's standing on." |
