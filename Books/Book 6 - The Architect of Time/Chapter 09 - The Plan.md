## Chapter 9: The Plan

### Scene 1: The Realization / The Wreckage

- **Key Event:** Angelica surveys the wreckage of the _Vanguard_.
- **Detailed Description:** For a week, Angelica disappears into the debris field of the crashed colony ship _Vanguard_. The wreck is a mountain of twisted metal, half-buried in the ice of the new world. The wind here is fierce, carrying ice shards that scour the hull. Angelica climbs through the skeletal remains of the superstructure, her datapad glowing in the twilight. She crawls through maintenance shafts, rappels down lift tubes, and scans the molecular density of the keel. She is looking for something specific: structural integrity.
- **Detailed Description:** She finds it. The central spine of the _Vanguard_—a rod of hyper-alloy forged in the orbital foundries of Earth—is intact. It is cracked, scarred, and frozen, but it is unbroken. Around the crash site, she identifies mineral deposits: veins of titanium and deposits of reactant fuel that leaked from the tanks and froze in the permafrost.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a surge of hope, terrifying in its intensity. She sees the pieces of a puzzle scattered across the ice. It is an impossible task. To build a ship from scrap, in a frozen wasteland, with a workforce of barbarians? It is madness. But the alternative is extinction.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She transitions from a survivor to an architect. She stops seeing the wreck as a grave and starts seeing it as a quarry.

### Scene 2: The Scale / The Elders' Hut

- **Key Event:** Angelica reveals the truth to Torin.
- **Detailed Description:** In the warmth of Torin's hut, amidst the furs and the fire, Angelica lays out her datapad. She projects a hologram of the solar system. She shows the red trajectory of the Alien Armada. They are twenty years away. It seems like a lifetime, but in astronomical terms, it is a blink. She explains the "Great Filter"—the alien intelligence that wipes out civilizations when they reach a certain energy level. The Zenith was just the first course. The planet is the main meal.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin listens, his face pale in the firelight. He is a man of stone and wood, a builder of huts. The concept of starships and armadas is almost beyond him. But he looks at Angelica's face, at the intensity in her eyes, and he believes her.
- **Internal Conflict:** Torin feels a deep, primal fear. He thought they had won. He thought the war was over. Now he learns that the peace is just a pause between breaths. He looks at his hands—rough, calloused. Can these hands build a starship?

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Torin (The Architect)** — He accepts the burden of knowledge. He does not deny the truth to save his peace of mind. He asks the practical question.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Twenty years. A generation. We will be old."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We will be ready. Or we will be dust. There is no third option."

### Scene 3: The Name / The Blueprint

- **Key Event:** Angelica reveals the design.
- **Detailed Description:** She sketches on the datapad, overlaying a new design onto the frame of the _Vanguard_. It is not a colony ship. It is not a luxury liner like the Zenith. It is a spear. Sleek, armored, built around a massive central gun. It is a ship designed for one purpose: to punch a hole through a blockade.
- **Detailed Description:** She names it. She writes the letters in the air with her finger. _Aeterna_. A phantom voice whispers in her ear—a memory of Lisbet's constant critiques.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lisbet (Memory):** "That structural stress load is garbage, Angie. You need triangular bracing on the keel or the torque will snap it like a twig."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** (Whispering to empty air) "I know, Glitch. I'm adding the bracing. Happy?"
- **Internal Conflict:** She thinks of the irony. They are mortal, fragile creatures building something eternal. They are building their own coffin, or their own chariot.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The Aeterna. The Eternal. Because this time, we are going to last. We aren't just surviving the winter, Torin. We are surviving forever. We are leaving a mark."

### Scene 4: The Promise / The Council Fire

- **Key Event:** Angelica addresses the tribe.
- **Detailed Description:** The entire settlement gathers around the central fire. Ragnar stands with his arms crossed, skeptical. The elders mutter. Angelica stands on a crate, raising her voice over the wind. She does not sugarcoat it. She tells them that the sky is coming to kill them. She tells them that their children are already dead if they do nothing.
- **Detailed Description:** Then, she offers them a purpose. She points to the wreck. She tells them that inside that metal mountain lies their salvation. She asks for twenty years of labor. Twenty years of mining, welding, starving, and freezing. She asks for their lives, in exchange for their species.
- **Internal Conflict:** She feels like a cult leader. She is selling them a dream that she isn't sure she can deliver. But when she looks at Ragnar, she sees a spark. The barbarian loves a challenge. He loves the impossible.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ _Sell the sizzle, not the steak,_ Zephyr used to say. _If you're selling a heist, don't tell them they might die. Tell them they're going to live forever._

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She displays the charisma of a true Commander. She sells the hardship, not the reward. She challenges their pride.
  - **Key Event:** The Weaver's Support.
  - **Detailed Description:** **Elder Corinne**, the tribe's matriarch of weaving and lore, steps forward. She has watched silently until now. She touches the fabric of Angelica's flight suit, appreciating the weave. She turns to the women of the tribe.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Elder Corinne:** "The weave she offers is tight, sisters. It will hold water. It will hold us. We follow."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We have the steel. You have the strength. I have the blueprints. We are going to build a way out. It will take twenty years. It will take every ounce of sweat and blood you have. It will be harder than any hunt, colder than any winter. But if you follow me, I promise you: we will never die. We will become the stars."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "Twenty years of heavy lifting? Sounds better than farming. I'm in."
