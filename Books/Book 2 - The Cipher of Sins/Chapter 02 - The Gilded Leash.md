## Chapter 2: The Murder

### Scene 1: The Message / Palace Dining Hall, Sector 1

- **Key Event:** The Palace Dining Hall is a cathedral of glass and gold, suspended three thousand feet above the Undercity smog. Angelica sits at a long table, mechanically eating a nutrient-rich soup that tastes like nothing.
- **Key Event:** Wardens stand at every corner, their crimson visors tracking every micro-movement.
- **Key Event:** A service drone—a small, silver beetle—hovers over her bowl. It drops something. A garnish? No.
- **Key Event:** A tiny, data-chip. It splashes softly into the broth.
- **Key Event:** Angelica freezes. She looks around. The Wardens noticed nothing.
- **Key Event:** She scoops the chip into her spoon, along with a mushroom. She places it in her mouth.
- **Key Event:** The chip vibrates against her tongue. Bone-conduction audio.
- **Key Event:** _"The Selection isn't about finding a soldier,"_ a voice whispers inside her skull. It is Archon Solon. _"It's about finding a vessel. The History is a lie. Meet me at the Archives. Midnight."_
- **Key Event:** Angelica swallows the mushroom and slides the chip under her tongue. She takes a sip of water. Her heart is hammering against her ribs, but her face is stone.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She demonstrates her alertness by subtly hiding the data-chip under her tongue.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Message:** "The Selection isn't about finding a soldier. It's about finding a vessel. Meet me at the Archives."

### Scene 2: The Archives / Imperial Library, Sector 1-Alpha

- **Key Event:** Midnight. Angelica sits in her quarters. She takes a scalpel from her medical kit.
- **Key Event:** She locates the subdermal tracker in her forearm. A small, pulsing blue light under the skin.
- **Key Event:** She bites down on a leather strap. She cuts.
- **Key Event:** The pain is sharp, white-hot. Blood wells up. She creates a small EMP burst with a modified battery to fry the chip before pulling it out.
- **Key Event:** She wraps the arm. She is a ghost now.
- **Key Event:** She slips through the ventilation ducts, bypassing the motion sensors she memorized during the "tour."
- **Key Event:** The Imperial Library is vast. Rows of data-crystals stretch into the dark.
- **Key Event:** She reaches the "Pre-Ascension History" section.
- **Key Event:** It is empty. The shelves are stripped bare. Dust outlines where the crystals used to be.
- **Key Event:** "They erased it," she whispers. "They erased Earth."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her resolve is shown when she performs painful self-surgery to remove her tracker.

### Scene 3: The Body / Imperial Library

- **Key Event:** Ideally, she finds Solon waiting.
- **Key Event:** Instead, she finds him slumped over a reading desk.
- **Key Event:** Blood pools on the obsidian surface, dripping onto the floor with a steady _tap-tap-tap_.
- **Key Event:** His throat has been slit with surgical precision.
- **Key Event:** But it's his forehead that makes her stomach turn. Branded into the skin is a symbol: a circle with four interlocking triangles. The Sigil of the Founders.
- **Key Event:** Angelica steps closer. She checks his pulse. Nothing.
- **Key Event:** Under his hand is a note. A physical piece of paper.
- **Key Event:** She pulls it free. It is stained with blood.
- **Key Event:** _"The Cylinder. Find the Cylinder. The truth is in the—"_
- **Key Event:** The rest is obscured by a red smear.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Magister Solon** — His corpse initiates the plot—he died trying to reveal the truth.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (reading his final note):** "The Cylinder. Find the Cylinder. The truth is in the—" _(blood obscures the rest)_

### Scene 4: The Frame / Imperial Library

- **Key Event:** _CLICK._
- **Key Event:** Floodlights snap on, blinding her.
- **Key Event:** "FREEZE!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica shields her eyes. Through the glare, she sees them. Twelve Wardens. Weapons drawn.
- **Key Event:** A Captain steps forward. He looks at the body. He looks at Angelica. He looks at the blood on her hands (from her own arm).
- **Key Event:** "You are under arrest for the murder of Magister Solon," the Captain states. "For High Treason against the Zenith."
- **Key Event:** He holds up a evidence bag. Inside is a glass dagger. "We found this in your quarters. Nice touch."
- **Key Event:** It's a frame. Perfect. Seamless.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the dead Archon. She looks at the empty shelves.
- **Key Event:** She doesn't raise her hands. She smiles. A cold, dangerous smile.
- **Key Event:** "History is written by the victors," she says. "But it's edited by the murderers."
- **Key Event:** She kicks the desk over and runs.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Faced with the frame-up, she chooses to resist rather than surrender.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Warden Captain:** "You are under arrest for the murder of Magister Solon. For High Treason against the Zenith."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "History is written by the victors. But it's edited by the murderers."
