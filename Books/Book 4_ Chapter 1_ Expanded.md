## Act I: The Stairwell

### Chapter 1: The Vacuum

#### Scene 1: The Void

The world did not end with a bang, but with a sudden, suffocating absence of gravity. Angelica Vance woke to the sensation of falling, but it was a disjointed, wrong kind of fall. It wasn't the stomach-churning plummet of a lift drop; it was a slow, spiraling drift through a void that smelled of ozone and ancient dust. Her eyes snapped open, expecting the familiar ceiling of her quarters in the Spire, or perhaps the cold steel of a cell. Instead, she saw the jagged, torn edge of the sky.

Above her—or what her inner ear insisted was "above"—the Zenith was gone. The pristine, glowing dome of the Golden Palace, the seat of the Emperor and the playground of the gods, was a gaping maw. The stars were gone, swallowed by the dark metal ceiling of the lower decks that now loomed overhead like the lid of a coffin. She was spinning slowly, end over end, in a pocket of failing gravity dampeners. The silence was absolute. No hum of the city, no distant murmur of ventilation, no thrum of the Spire’s resonance engine. Just the terrifying quiet of a machine that had finally, catastrophically, stopped.

Angelica gasped, the air thin and biting cold. Her breath bloomed in a cloud of crystals before her face. She tried to move, to orient herself, but in zero-g, her limbs flailed uselessly against nothing. Panic, cold and sharp, tried to seize her chest. Her hand flew to her neck, checking for a pulse that fluttered like a trapped bird—her old arrhythmia, the defect that had defined her childhood in the Undercity, hammering a frantic rhythm against her fingertips. *I am alive,* she told herself, the thought a desperate anchor. *I am broken, but I am here.*

She looked down. Below her was an abyss of darkness so profound it felt heavy. The Undercity. Sector 12. Home. But it was miles away, a distant floor of a canyon she was drifting towards. She wasn't just falling; she was suspended in the wreckage of the world. Debris floated around her—shards of gold plating from the palace, frozen droplets of water, the broken body of a servant droid still clutching a silver tray. It was a surreal, horrific mobile spinning in the dark.

#### Scene 2: The Anchor

Something hard struck her shoulder, jarring her bone and sending a fresh wave of nausea through her. *Clang.* The sound vibrated through her suit more than the air. She scrambled for a grip, her fingers finding purchase on a cold metal strut. It was a support beam, twisted and sheared off at the end. She clung to it, her knuckles white, grounding herself against the dizzying spin of the void.

As she stabilized, she felt a tug at her waist. She looked down. A high-tensile cable was wrapped around her midsection, the carabiner locked tight. It stretched out into the darkness, taut and humming with tension. She followed the line with her eyes, squinting against the gloom. The other end was attached to a pair of magnetic boots locked onto a larger structural beam a few meters away.

Hanging upside down like a bat, arms dangling limp, was Zephyr.

"Zephyr!" she croaked, her voice sounding small and flat in the thin air.

The Rogue didn't move. His long leather duster floated around him like the wings of a dead bird. His left arm—the masterpiece of mid-level scrap art, brass gears and hydraulic pistons—hung uselessly at his side. It looked heavy, a dead weight dragging him down.

Angelica pulled herself along the cable, hand over hand. The lack of gravity made it easier, but the fear made her clumsy. She reached him, grabbing the lapels of his coat.

"Wake up, you shiny idiot," she hissed, shaking him.

His head lolled. His face was pale, the scruff on his jaw frosted with ice. The gold tooth that usually flashed with his lopsided grin was hidden behind blue lips. She slapped his cheek, harder than she intended.

"Come on. I can't do this alone. Wake up."

Zephyr groaned, a low, pained sound. His eyelids fluttered. His right eye, the warm brown one, opened first, unfocused and glassy. Then the left, the cybernetic ocular, whirred to life, its blue targeting reticle flickering as it tried to boot up.

"Princess?" he mumbled, his voice thick. "Did we win?"

"No," Angelica said grimly, checking the readout on his mag-boots. The battery was flashing red. "We definitely didn't win."

Zephyr blinked, trying to orient himself. He looked at the void around them, then at his dead arm. He tried to lift it, but the servo-motors whined and failed. He grimaced. "My arm. It's offline. The bond... my counter..."

He twisted his wrist to look at the digital display embedded in his flesh. It was dark. *ERROR*, it flashed briefly, then died.

"The power's out," Angelica said. "Everywhere. We're running on emergency reserves."

#### Scene 3: The View

Angelica hauled herself up to the beam Zephyr was anchored to, dragging him with her as the gravity began to fluctuate, returning in sickening lurches. She locked her legs around the strut and looked out.

From this vantage point, she could see the scale of the catastrophe. The Palace Spire, the glittering needle that had pierced the sky of the Zenith, was gone. Ejected. The hole it left was a massive, jagged wound in the hull of the city. Through that hole, she could see the faint, mocking twinkle of stars—real stars, not the projected holograms of the dome.

"Look at it," she whispered, a shiver running down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.

Zephyr squinted, his cyber-eye zooming in. "The Spire... it punched through the floor. It took out the support columns for Sectors 1 through 3."

Angelica looked down into the abyss. The Undercity, usually a place of smog and neon, was a pit of shadows. But here and there, she could see fires burning—tiny, flickering orange dots that marked the crash sites. The debris from the Zenith was raining down on the slums below. A piece of the Golden Palace, a massive chunk of marble and gold leaf the size of a house, drifted past them in the low gravity. It collided with a rusted ventilation pipe with a sound like a thunderclap, shattering into dust.

"The Great Fall," Angelica murmured. The ancient prophecy the Silt-rats whispered about. The day the sky would fall and crush the poor. It wasn't a metaphor. It was physics.

"We need to move," Zephyr said, his voice tightening. "Gravity dampeners are failing completely. In about five minutes, we're going to stop floating and start plummeting. And I don't fancy being a stain on the pavement of Sector 12."

#### Scene 4: The Realization

Angelica tapped her wrist comp. The screen flickered static. *Signal Lost.* *Network Down.* *Beacon Offline.*

She looked at Zephyr. He was checking his pulse, his face grey. He looked smaller without his swagger, without the constant hum of his wealth protecting him. He looked like what he was: a scared kid from the Mid-Levels with a lot of debt and a broken toy arm.

"We're alone," she said. "No retrieval team. No Imperial Guard. The Emperor is dead or gone. Vane is gone."

"We're exiles," Zephyr corrected, spitting a glob of blood that floated for a second before drifting down. "Trash. Just like we started."

Angelica watched another piece of the palace fall. It was a statue of the First Emperor, headless now, tumbling into the dark. It struck a catwalk far below, tearing through the metal like it was paper.

She realized then that the hierarchy of the world had inverted. The Zenith was no longer the top. It was the ammunition falling on the bottom.

"We didn't fall from grace," Angelica said, her voice hardening, taking on the edge of the Commander she would have to become. She looked into the abyss, her golden eyes reflecting the distant fires. "We fell from orbit."

"Orbit?" Zephyr looked at her, confused. "We're underground, Princess. We're in a cave."

"Are we?" She pointed to the hole in the sky, to the stars that were too bright, too sharp. "Look at the curvature, Zephyr. Look at the void."

He looked. He saw the blackness that wasn't rock, but emptiness.

"We're not in a cave," he whispered, the realization dawning with the weight of a planet.

"Survival," Angelica said, checking the mag-locks on her boots. "That's the only objective now. We have to get to the ground before the ground comes up to meet us."

She offered him her hand. It was small, scarred, and covered in engine grease—the hand of the mechanic she used to be.

"Ready to go home, rat?"

Zephyr looked at her hand, then at his own useless, golden limb. He smirked, the ghost of his old charm flickering for a second.

"Ladies first," he said, and unclipped his tether.

They dropped into the dark together.
