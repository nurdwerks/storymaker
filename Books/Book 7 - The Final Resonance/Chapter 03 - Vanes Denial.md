## Chapter 03: Vane's Denial

### Scene 1: The Ship-Wide Broadcast

- **Key Event:** Prelate Vane addresses the population via the ship's holographic emergency system.
- **Detailed Description:** The broadcast overrides every screen on the *Aeterna*, from the massive displays in the Promenade to the personal datapads of the crew. Vane appears in his full ceremonial regalia, the gold and white robes of the High Council. The image is crisp, filtered to remove the sweat from his brow and the dark circles under his eyes. He stands before a stylized backdrop of the ship's logo, projecting an image of absolute stability. He addresses the "anomaly" (the Sphere) not as a threat, but as a "Traveler" or a "Test." He claims he is in active negotiations with the entity and that the silence is merely a "cultural difference," a pause before the exchange of wisdom.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane is lying, and he knows it. But his narcissism allows him to believe the lie as he speaks it. He views the crew not as people to be informed, but as an audience to be managed. He fears panic more than he fears the Sphere, because panic threatens his control. He convinces himself that if he says it is safe, he can make it safe.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — He uses his charisma to gaslight the crew, smiling with a practiced warmth that doesn't reach his eyes. He believes he can manipulate a cosmic force just like he manipulated the Council.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "Citizens of the Aeterna, do not fear the geometry. It is merely a visitor. A test of our resolve. I have the situation under control. The silence is not a threat; it is a pause. A breath before we ascend."

- **Key Event:** The crew's reaction to the broadcast.
- **Detailed Description:** In the lower decks, the reaction is mixed. Some, desperate for hope, cling to Vane's words like drowning men to driftwood. They return to their duties, ignoring the dread in their guts. Others, the cynics and the survivors of the "Stone Season," see through the polish. They note the tremor in Vane's hand when he gestures. They see the sweat that the filters missed. They start hoarding rations.

### Scene 2: The Lower Decks / The Shadows

- **Key Event:** Old Man Rust sits alone in a maintenance alcove.
- **Detailed Description:** Rust, the blind seer of the ship's underbelly, sits in the dark. He does not need eyes to see the arrival of the End. He tilts his head, listening to the vibration of the ship's hull. Usually, the *Aeterna* hums with the life of a city—footsteps, pumps, laughter. Now, the hull vibrates with a low, dissonance frequency. It feels like the ship is shivering. Rust smells the air—recycled ozone, stale food, and something else. A metallic, sterile scent. The smell of "nothing."
- **Internal Conflict:** Rust feels a primal fear. He has survived radiation, starvation, and mutiny. But he cannot survive "deletion." He knows the difference between death (which smells like rot) and erasure (which smells like ozone). He touches the walls, feeling the "cold" of the void penetrating the thermal shielding.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Old Man Rust** — He runs his hand along a pipe, feeling the cold seep through the metal. He realizes the cold is coming from *outside*, from the void itself.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Rust:** "That ain't a visitor. That's a tombstone. I can smell the earth. It's here to bury us. Vane is talking to a gravestone."

### Scene 3: Vane's Private Sanctum

- **Key Event:** Alone in his spire, Vane drops the facade.
- **Detailed Description:** The moment the "On Air" light turns off, Vane slumps into his chair. He rips the heavy ceremonial collar from his neck, gasping for air. The room is silent, insulated from the ship. He rolls up his sleeve, revealing the "injection ports" in his arm—the bio-ports where he injects the refined Prima-Materia to boost his intellect and lifespan. The ports glow with a faint, sick green light. He speaks to them, treating the substance as a direct line to the divine.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane is terrifyingly lonely. He has no allies, only subjects. He desperately needs the Sphere to be a "Test" because if it is just a natural disaster, he is powerless. He needs to be special. He needs to be the "Chosen One" who negotiates the peace. The silence of the Sphere mocks his eloquence.

- **Key Event:** Vane reveals his delusion.
- **Detailed Description:** He stands by the window, looking out at the black Sphere. He speaks to it. He interprets the silence as a personal challenge. He thinks the Sphere has come to *collect* him as a prophet, not destroy the ship. He sees himself as the bridge between humanity and the next stage of evolution. He begins to draft a "treaty" on a datapad, outlining the terms of humanity's surrender in exchange for his own elevation.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Vane** — He touches the glass, staring at his own reflection superimposed over the alien object. He smiles, a twisted, genuine smile of madness.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "I have prepared the harvest. I kept them alive for you. I am your vessel. Acknowledge me! Speak to me! Do not ignore the architect of this survival!"

### Scene 4: The Council

- **Key Event:** Vane bullies the Trade Minister.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane summons the Trade Minister, a nervous man named Harlin. Harlin reports that food stocks are spoiling due to the entropy field. Vane screams at him, throwing a goblet of wine across the room. He refuses to hear about logistics. He demands that the "feast" be prepared for the visitors.
- **Internal Conflict:** Vane cannot handle mundane problems when he is focused on cosmic ones. He projects his fear as anger.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane:** "Do not bore me with spoilage, Harlin! We are on the verge of godhood, and you talk of mold? Get out!"
