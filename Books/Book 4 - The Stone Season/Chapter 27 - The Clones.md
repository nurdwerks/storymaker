## Chapter 27: The Clones

### Scene 1: The Realization / The Cloning Facility, Sector 9

- **Key Event:** The facility is sterile white. Row upon row of glass tanks stretch into the darkness.
- **Key Event:** Inside the tanks are bodies. Suspended in amber fluid.
- **Key Event:** Angelica walks down the aisle. Her reflection walks with her in every tank.
- **Key Event:** They are all her.
- **Key Event:** Some are younger. Some are older. Some are half-formed. But the face is unmistakable.
- **Key Event:** "High-Tier Clone," Aris reads from a console. "Series Alpha. Purpose: Command and Control."
- **Key Event:** Angelica stares at a tank. The clone inside has her scar—no, wait. That's a birthmark. It's genetic.
- **Key Event:** "I'm... a copy," she whispers. "My mother... she didn't have a child. She grew one."
- **Key Event:** Kaelen stands behind her. He looks at the tanks, then at Angelica.
- **Key Event:** "Does it matter?" he asks.
- **Key Event:** "Of course it matters!" Angelica spins around. "I'm manufactured, Kaelen! I'm a product! Just like the Blighted!"
- **Key Event:** Kaelen shakes his head. "The DNA doesn't make the Captain. The choices do. I follow the woman, not the template. You stood in the fire. They're just floating in soup."

### Scene 2: The Malfunction / The Facility

- **Key Event:** A warning siren blares.
- **Key Event:** Tank 4-Bravo cracks. Fluid spills onto the floor.
- **Key Event:** The clone inside wakes up. It hasn't finished baking. Its skin is raw, red. Its eyes are milky white.
- **Key Event:** It crashes through the glass. It screams—a sound of pure confusion and pain.
- **Key Event:** It lunges at Angelica. It sees her face and recognizes it. It hates it.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stumbles back, raising her rifle.
- **Key Event:** The clone is fast. It tackles her. Hands—_her_ hands—wrap around her throat.
- **Key Event:** "It has my eyes!" Angelica screams, staring into the milky void. "It has my eyes!"
- **Key Event:** Ria raises her weapon. "Close them, then! Pull the trigger!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica squeezes her eyes shut. She fires. _Point blank._
- **Key Event:** The weight lifts off her chest. She pushes the body away. It's warm. It's her.

### Scene 3: The Choice / The Control Room

- **Key Event:** They retreat to the control room. Angelica is shaking. She wipes the clone's blood off her face. It looks just like her own blood.
- **Key Event:** "We can end this," Aris says, typing at the main terminal. "I've found the master sequence."
- **Key Event:** "The Pathogen," he explains. "It's locked to the genome. If we introduce a Pure Sequence—an original Alpha—we can reset the biological locks. We can flush the Pathogen out of the entire ship."
- **Key Event:** "But?" Angelica asks.
- **Key Event:** "But the sequence is corrupted," Aris says. "We need a fresh sample. A total transfusion."
- **Key Event:** He looks at Angelica. "We need... your blood. All of it. To overwrite the system."
- **Key Event:** "You're asking me to die," she says flatly.
- **Key Event:** "I'm asking you to fulfill your purpose," Aris says. "You were built to save the ship. This is why you exist."

### Scene 4: The Defiance / The Control Room

- **Key Event:** The room is silent.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen's hand goes to his sword.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the screen. **INSERT SAMPLE.**
- **Key Event:** She thinks about the tanks. The copies. The destiny written in her genes.
- **Key Event:** Then she thinks about the library. The fire. The choice to burn the books.
- **Key Event:** She stands up.
- **Key Event:** "No," she says.
- **Key Event:** "The math doesn't allow for another way!" Aris argues. "You are a variable in a larger equation! If you don't do this, the Pathogen wins!"
- **Key Event:** "I am not a battery for your machine," Angelica says, smashing the console with the butt of her rifle. Sparks fly.
- **Key Event:** "I am a person. We find another way. We find a cure. We don't just hit the reset button."
- **Key Event:** "You just destroyed our only hope!" Aris screams.
- **Key Event:** "No," Angelica says, walking to the door. "I just changed the math."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Then I'll change the math."
