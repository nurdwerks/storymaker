## Chapter 4: Ascent

### Scene 1: The Elevator

- **Key Event:** The Great Lift carries Angelica three miles up the Spire exterior in under ninety seconds, subjecting her to crushing G-force.

- **Key Event:** Angelica experiences the sun unfiltered for the first time—blinding white-gold light that causes physical pain to her smog-adapted eyes.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Realizes how small the Undercity is—just a dark stain on the planet's surface—and feels hatred for the sterile beauty of the Zenith.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Too bright. It's too bright."

### Scene 2: The Tributes

- **Key Event:** Angelica is deposited in the Holding Pen—a steel cage suspended over the Academy courtyard with 49 other "Iron Squad" candidates.

- **Key Event:** The candidates are described: gangbangers, thumpers, murderers—huge, scarred individuals with kill-count tattoos.

- **Key Event:** Jax, a boy with a gear-tooth tattoo, shoves Angelica when she bumps into him. She doesn't fight back but begins scanning the other candidates with her datapad.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Jax:** "Watch it, Runt."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "You're blocking the light."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Jax:** "I'll block your air, trash."

### Scene 3: The Realization

- **Key Event:** Angelica analyzes the other candidates' weaknesses using her datapad: Jax's injured left knee, nervous twitches, withdrawal symptoms, and one quiet, meditating girl who registers as a high danger.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Reduces the intimidating fighters from monsters to variables that can be solved and manipulated.

- **Key Event:** Angelica recognizes the true nature of the Selection: it's not a fistfight but an engineering problem. The candidates are "obsolete hardware"; she is "software."

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Vance** — Realizes she is the smallest, weakest, and most breakable person—and therefore the most dangerous.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "They think strength is about how much you can lift. Strength is about how much you can break."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "And I can break everything."
