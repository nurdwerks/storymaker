## Chapter 11: The Construct

### Scene 1: The Airlock

- **Key Event:** Kaelen steps out onto the hull alongside Ria using mag-boots. He attempts to manifest a Shadow Construct (a giant spectral hand) to grab the Planar Shard.
- **Key Event:** The Shard reacts to the magic. It spins faster, emitting a high-pitched resonance.

### Scene 2: The Feedback Loop

- **Key Event:** When Kaelen's shadow touches the Shard, a psychic backlash travels up the connection.
- **Key Event:** Kaelen screams as geometric patterns burn themselves into his mind. He collapses on the hull.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen** — He experiences the Entity's "thought process" for a split second—a cold, infinite calculation that nearly wipes his ego.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen:** "It's so... loud. The math is so loud."

### Scene 3: The Rescue

- **Key Event:** Ria drags Kaelen back toward the airlock while Titan deflects razor-thin beams of light from the Shard.
- **Key Event:** Titan's armor is sliced, but holds. The physical metal is more resistant than Kaelen's magic.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Don't think about it, Prince! Just move your legs!"
