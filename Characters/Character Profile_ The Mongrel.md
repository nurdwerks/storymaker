# Character Profile: The Mongrel

**Archetype:** The Enforcer / The Beast
**True Sin:** WRATH (His protection is not born of love, but of a shared hatred for anything "clean" or "Zenith").
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (He frames his animalistic aggression as "Territorial Defense").

## I. Role in the Story

The Mongrel is a massive, scarred man who barely speaks, guarding the entrance to Hatcher’s camp. He represents the primal fear and defensive violence of the Silt’s outcasts.

- **The Threat:** He growls at Angelica like a wild animal, treating her as a foreign object that needs to be chased out of his territory.
- **The Loyalty:** His absolute, wordless devotion to Hatcher—whom he sees as the "King of the Silt"—serves as a reminder that Hatcher has a kingdom and a family, and Angelica is just a guest.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Absolute Silence / Death. During a raid by a rival Silt-gang, The Mongrel is killed while defending Hatcher’s back. He dies without saying a single word, a silent guardian to the end.
- **Impact on Hatcher:** Hatcher loses his "beast." The loss of his most loyal and wordless companion shatters his sense of safety in the Silt. He becomes increasingly paranoid and aggressive, viewing every "stranger" (including Angelica) as a potential threat.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Guard" is gone. The camp no longer feels like a secure territory. The other members of the Null Crew live in a state of constant fear, as they realize that the Silt is no longer a place of hiding, but a place of hunting.

## III. Book 4 Integration (The Stone Season)

- **Location:** Chapter 17 ("The Null Raid")
- **Scene:** "The Silence." The Mongrel dies defending the gate from the Rust-Eaters. He takes a spear to the chest but kills his attacker before falling.
- **Role:** The Final Shield. His death signifies the loss of Hatcher’s physical protection.
- **Quote:** _(Silence. He points to the safety of the tunnel, then dies.)_
