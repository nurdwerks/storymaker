### Scene 1: The Airlock (The Transition)

- **Key Event:** The survivors crowd into the final airlock chamber.
- **Detailed Description:** The chamber is a massive, cylindrical room lined with ribbed padding and handholds. The air smells sterile and recycled, a sharp contrast to the rot and smoke of the lower levels. As the heavy inner door seals with a hydraulic hiss, the pressure in the room drops. The ambient noise of the ship—the hum of ventilation, the vibration of the engines—fades away, leaving a thick, heavy silence. The lighting shifts from white to red emergency strobes.
- **Internal Conflict:** The group is terrified. They have spent their entire lives under a stone sky. The concept of "outside" is theoretical and terrifying. Kaelen grips his sword hilt, his knuckles white, seeking comfort in a weapon that is useless against a vacuum.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "My ears are popping. The air is getting thin."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Equalizing pressure. Don't swallow. Yawn."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "If this door opens and there's nothing there, I'm going to kill you, Aris."

- **Key Event:** The Decompression Cycle completes.
- **Detailed Description:** A robotic voice announces, "Cycle Complete. Exterior Access Granted." The outer wheel of the airlock begins to spin. The groan of metal on metal is deafening as locks that haven't moved in three centuries are forced open.

### Scene 2: The Panic (Corinne's Break)

- **Key Event:** Lady Corinne suffers a panic attack as the gravity fluctuates.
- **Detailed Description:** As the room depressurizes, the artificial gravity plating flickers. For a moment, everyone feels light, their stomachs dropping as if in freefall. Corinne collapses to the floor, curling into a ball. Her fine clothes are tattered, her face smeared with grime. The realization hits her: the "solid ground" of the Zenith—the immutable foundation of her noble life—is a lie. It is just a spinning drum in the dark.
- **Internal Conflict:** Corinne's worldview shatters. She wasn't born on a mountain; she was born in a tin can. Her superiority was based on altitude, and now she realizes altitude is relative. She is terrified of falling into the endless nothingness she suspects is outside.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — Clutches Angelica's hand, finally losing all her pretenses of "Silver" superiority in the face of the infinite.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "It’s not a floor. It's a cage. We’re falling! We’ve been falling for a thousand years!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Look at me, Corinne. Gravity is just math. We aren't falling. We're flying."

### Scene 3: The Void (The First Sight)

- **Key Event:** The outer shutters slide back, revealing the Observation Dome.
- **Detailed Description:** The blast shutters retract with a grinding screech. Suddenly, the red emergency light is washed out by the cold, hard light of the stars. The entire far wall is a single sheet of reinforced hyper-glass. Beyond it is the void. It is not the blue sky of the holograms. It is black—an absolute, crushing blackness speckled with millions of unblinking white dots. The Milky Way stretches across the view, a river of diamond dust. A nearby nebula glows with bruised purples and blood reds.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica stops breathing. The scale of it crushes her. She grew up in tunnels where the ceiling was ten feet up. Here, there is no ceiling. The sheer openness triggers agoraphobia and awe simultaneously. She feels tiny, insignificant, and exhilaratingly free.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Sees the stars for the first time; they are not points of light in the ceiling, but distant, cold suns.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "They're beautiful. And they're so... far away."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "That's a lot of empty."

### Scene 4: The Truth (The Generation Ship)

- **Key Event:** The group identifies the structure of the Zenith.
- **Detailed Description:** Looking "up" through the glass, they see the rest of their world. A massive, rotating ring stretches into the distance, curved like the inside of a tire. They can see the lights of Sector 1, the dark patch of the Undercity, and the Spire connecting the hub to the rim. It is undeniable. The entire world they fought over—the wars, the class systems, the borders—is just a centrifugal habitat spinning in the dark.
- **Internal Conflict:** Zephyr laughs. It's a hollow, broken sound. He spent his life trying to buy his way to the "High Decks." Now he sees that the High Decks are just the part of the wheel closer to the void. The irony is bitter.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Look up. That's not the sky. That's the High Decks. We’re on a giant wheel. We're hamsters."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "A Generation Ship. Model: The Ark. Target: Epsilon Eridani. We missed the target by three centuries. We're drifting."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "So there is no ground. There is no Zenith. Just... this."

- **Key Event:** Angelica accepts the reality.
- **Detailed Description:** While the others spiral into existential dread, Angelica presses her hand against the cold glass. She traces the line of the nebula. She doesn't feel despair; she feels purpose. The world isn't broken; it's just a machine. And she knows how to fix machines.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's not a wheel, Zephyr. It's a ship. And ships have helms. We just need to find the driver."

### Scene 5: The Reflection (Identity Crisis)

- **Key Event:** The group sees their own reflections in the glass against the backdrop of the universe.
- **Detailed Description:** As the initial shock fades, they notice their reflections ghosted over the stars. They are filthy, bloody, and exhausted. They look like specks of dust against the galaxy. Corinne touches her face, realizing she is no longer the Porcelain Doll. Kaelen sees his armor is dented and scratched. They are small.
- **Internal Conflict:** This is the moment of ego death for the group. The petty squabbles of the last few weeks—who leads, who follows, who is noble—evaporate in the face of the cosmic scale. They realize that they are all they have. The silence of the void binds them together more tightly than any oath.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — She lowers her weapon. For the first time, she realizes there is nothing out there to fight. The enemy is simply distance and time.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "We're alone. Truly alone."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. We're together. And we have a ship to fly."
