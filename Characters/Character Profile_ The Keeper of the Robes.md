## I. Role in the Story

The Keeper of the Robes is a servant responsible for the Emperor's clothes—and, more importantly, the holographic emitters that maintain his image. He is a key player in the Zenith's theater of power.

- **The Task:** He fusses over the Emperor's image as if it were biological reality, maintaining the illusion of a living, breathing ruler.
- **The Scorn:** He sneers at Angelica’s utilitarian Silt-wear, viewing her practical clothes as an affront to the "divinity" of the Imperial image he works so hard to project.

- **Defining Quote:** "His hand still clutching a datapad that contained a broadcast code he never sent." (Narrative description, reveals flaw: SLOTH/FAILED REDEMPTION)
