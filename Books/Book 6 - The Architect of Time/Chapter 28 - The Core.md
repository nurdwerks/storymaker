## Chapter 28: The Core

### Scene 1: The Drill / Mount Silas, Mid-Slope

- **Key Event:** The drill is a beast. A scavenged turbine engine rigged to a diamond-tipped boring head.
- **Key Event:** It screams as it eats the rock. The sound is deafening, shaking the fillings in their teeth.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar stands at the controls. He is shirtless. His skin is red from the heat.
- **Key Event:** "Temperature check!" he bellows.
- **Key Event:** "One hundred and thirty degrees!" a miner shouts back. "We're cooking in here, Chief!"
- **Key Event:** "Then rotate!" Ragnar orders. "Ten-minute shifts! If you stop sweating, you get out! I don't want any corpses clogging the shaft!"
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches from the ridge. She checks the thermal scans. They are close to the magma pocket.
- **Key Event:** "It's like surgery," she mutters to Torin. "With a sledgehammer."

### Scene 2: The Breach / The Tunnel

- **Key Event:** _CRACK._
- **Key Event:** A pocket of methane gas hits the drill bit.
- **Key Event:** The explosion blows the heavy machinery back five feet. A gout of blue flame erupts from the borehole.
- **Key Event:** A young miner, barely sixteen, freezes in the path of the fire.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar doesn't hesitate. He dives.
- **Key Event:** He tackles the boy, shielding him with his massive back.
- **Key Event:** The fire washes over Ragnar. His skin blisters. He roars, but he doesn't move.
- **Key Event:** The fire dies down. Ragnar stands up. He is burned, smoking.
- **Key Event:** "Chief!" the boy gasps.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar grabs a shovel. He ignores the pain.
- **Key Event:** "I'm fine!" he barks. "The rock is soft! Keep drilling! We do not stop for fire!"
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ragnar** — He endures blisters and fire to ensure the drilling continues.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "I'm fine! ... Keep drilling! ... We do not stop for fire!"

### Scene 3: The Flow / The Collection Chamber

- **Key Event:** Three hours later. A low rumble shakes the mountain.
- **Key Event:** "Breach!"
- **Key Event:** The drill breaks through into the magma chamber.
- **Key Event:** Liquid rock, glowing orange-white, surges up the ceramic channel. It doesn't explode; it flows. Controlled. Directed.
- **Key Event:** It hits the heat exchangers. Steam turbines spin up.
- **Key Event:** The hum of power generation begins. It starts as a whine and deepens into a roar.
- **Key Event:** The superconducting cable begins to glow faint blue.
- **Key Event:** "We have flow," Torin reports, checking the gauges. "Pressure is stable. Output is... incredible."

### Scene 4: The Power / The _Aeterna_ Bridge

- **Key Event:** On the ship, the lights flicker. Then they burn steady. Brighter than before.
- **Key Event:** The fuel gauge moves. **1%... 5%... 10%...**
- **Key Event:** Angelica watches the numbers climb. She feels the vibration of the ship coming alive beneath her feet.
- **Key Event:** She looks out at the volcano, spewing smoke into the sky.
- **Key Event:** "Prometheus," she whispers.
- **Key Event:** "What?" Torin asks over the comms.
- **Key Event:** "A legend," Angelica says. "He stole fire from the gods to give to man. That's what we're doing."
- **Key Event:** She places her hand on the console.
- **Key Event:** "Fire from the earth to reach the sky," she says. "We are stealing fire from the gods, Torin. And we are going to use it to leave them behind."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Fire from the earth to reach the sky. ... We are stealing fire from the gods, Torin. And we are going to use it to leave them behind."
