## Chapter 21: The Exorcism

### Scene 1: The Trap

- **Key Event:** The Setting.
- **Detailed Description:** The Reactor Core of the _Aeterna_. It is a cavernous, spherical room situated in the bowels of the ship. In the center, the reactor itself pulses with a dangerous, unstable rhythm—a heartbeat of raw fusion that makes the metal catwalks vibrate. The air is hot, smelling of ozone and ionized metal.
- **Key Event:** The Construction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands on the primary catwalk, sweat dripping from her forehead. She is building something. A device that looks less like engineering and more like madness. It is a "ghost trap."
- **Key Event:** The Components.
- **Detailed Description:** It is a pile of junk, meticulously wired together.
  - A disassembled Tesla coil scavenged from the med-bay's defibrillator unit.
  - Coils of thick copper wire stripped from a comms relay.
  - A containment field emitter from a brig cell.
  - And in the center, mounted on a rubberized pedestal, is a massive, raw quartz crystal she mined from the cave earlier in the timeline. It is jagged, milky white, and as big as a human head.
- **Key Event:** The Skepticism.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin stands in the doorway, keeping his distance. He holds a heavy, lead-lined box in his hands. He looks at the contraption with deep concern.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "This is insane. You are building a lightning rod inside a fusion reactor."
- **Key Event:** The Logic.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica doesn't look up. She is tightening a contact screw with a multi-tool.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It's physics, Torin. Ghosts—or energy projections, or whatever Vane has become—are just ionic patterns. They are organized static. They follow the path of least resistance."
- **Key Event:** The Explanation.
- **Detailed Description:** She connects the final wire.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Static seeks a ground. I'm giving him the ultimate ground. A perfect, conductive lattice structure. Quartz is piezo-electric. It can hold a charge."
- **Key Event:** The Role.
- **Detailed Description:** She points to herself.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "And you? Where do you fit in?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm the bait. He wants a vessel. He wants a body to pilot. I'm going to offer him one."

### Scene 2: The Lure

- **Key Event:** The Preparation.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin retreats to the shielded control room overlooking the core. The heavy blast doors hiss shut and seal with a magnetic lock. Through the thick glass, he watches Angelica standing alone on the bridge.
- **Key Event:** The Projection.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica closes her eyes. She takes a deep breath of the superheated air. She does something she has spent years learning not to do: she lowers her mental shields. She opens the fortress of her mind.
- **Key Event:** The Call.
- **Detailed Description:** She thinks about Vane. She thinks about his arrogance, his cruelty, his obsession. She projects her fear and her anger outward. She makes herself "loud" in the psychic spectrum—a beacon in the dark.
  - _Internal Monologue:_ Come on, you old vulture. Come and get me. I'm right here. Unprotected. Weak. Just the way you like them.
- **Key Event:** The Arrival.
- **Detailed Description:** The temperature in the room drops instantly. Frost blooms on the metal railing, cracking as it freezes. The condensation in the air turns to ice fog.
- **Key Event:** The Darkness.
- **Detailed Description:** The overhead lights flicker and die. The red emergency strobes burst. The only illumination comes from the blue, pulsating glow of the reactor below and the arcs of stray static jumping between the coils.
- **Key Event:** The Entity.
- **Detailed Description:** A sound begins. A whisper that sounds like it is coming from inside her own ears. It swells into a chorus—a thousand voices overlapping, screaming, pleading. A shape forms in the air above the reactor. A storm of grey static and pure malice. It has no face, but she feels the weight of its gaze.
- **Key Event:** The Threat.
- **Detailed Description:** The voice vibrates in her teeth. It is Vane's voice, distorted by the void.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Vane (Entity):** _"Angelica... I will wear your skin like a suit. I will use your body to pilot the ship. And when we arrive, I will burn the Zenith to the ground."_
- **Key Event:** The Attack.
- **Detailed Description:** The entity lunges. A bolt of pure, conscious electricity arcs from the cloud toward her chest.

### Scene 3: The Capture

- **Key Event:** The Discipline.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica doesn't flinch. She holds her ground. She waits. She waits until he is inches away. Until she can smell the ozone of his presence and feel the static lifting the hair on her arms.
- **Key Event:** The Spring.
- **Detailed Description:** "Now!" she screams. She slams her gloved hand onto the activator switch.
- **Key Event:** The Trap.
- **Detailed Description:** _CRACK-BOOM._ The Tesla coil shrieks to life. Huge arcs of blue lightning jump from the emitters, forming a cage around her. A Faraday cage.
- **Key Event:** The Screech.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane hits the energy field and screams. It is not a human scream. It is the sound of tearing metal and feedback loops. The electricity grabs his ionic form. It pulls him away from Angelica's biology.
- **Key Event:** The Channeling.
- **Detailed Description:** The field channels him down the thick copper wires. He flows like water, unable to resist the conductivity. He is funneled into the crystal.
- **Key Event:** The Containment.
- **Detailed Description:** The quartz crystal glows. First bright white. Then blinding blue. Then a deep, angry violet.
- **Key Event:** The Struggle.
- **Detailed Description:** The room shakes violently. Bolts loosen and ping off the walls. The crystal vibrates on the pedestal, threatening to shatter under the pressure of holding a human soul.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Hold it together! Don't break! Conserve the lattice!"
- **Key Event:** The Face.
- **Detailed Description:** For a second, a face presses against the inside of the crystal. Vane's face. Distorted, screaming in silent agony.
- **Key Event:** The End.
- **Detailed Description:** With a final, sickening _pop_, the resistance breaks. The rest of the static cloud is sucked inside. The light stabilizes.
- **Key Event:** The Silence.
- **Detailed Description:** The room goes deadly silent. The frost begins to melt. Angelica collapses to her knees, gasping for air.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Gotcha."

### Scene 4: The Battery

- **Key Event:** The Item.
- **Detailed Description:** The crystal sits on the pedestal. It is hot—radiating heat waves. It pulses with a steady, violet rhythm. Like a heart.
- **Key Event:** The Retrieval.
- **Detailed Description:** Torin rushes in from the control room. He is wearing heavy insulated gloves. He uses long tongs to grab the crystal.
- **Key Event:** The Prison.
- **Detailed Description:** He drops it into the lead box. _Clunk._ He slams the heavy lid and engages the triple locks.
- **Key Event:** The Confirmation.
- **Detailed Description:** He looks at Angelica.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Is he...?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He's in there. He's trapped in the lattice."
- **Key Event:** The Check.
- **Detailed Description:** She stands up, her legs shaky. She walks over to the box. She taps the lid with her finger.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Can he get out?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "No. Not without a conductor. He's insulated. He's just stored energy now. He's a battery."
- **Key Event:** The Irony.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica smiles. It is a terrifying, predatory smile.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We needed more power to reach warp velocity. The reactor wasn't enough. We just found the deficit."
- **Key Event:** The Address.
- **Detailed Description:** She leans down and speaks to the box.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Congratulations, Prelate. You wanted power? You just became the backup generator. You're going to help us fly, whether you like it or not."
- **Key Event:** The Order.
- **Detailed Description:** She turns to Torin.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Plug him in. Let's see how many terawatts a soul is worth."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She demonstrates her ultimate pragmatism, turning her greatest enemy into a resource to save her people.
