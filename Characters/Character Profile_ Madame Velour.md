## I. Role in the Story

Madame Velour is Baron Gilded's personal tailor and fabricator. She is obsessed with maintaining the "majestic form" of the gold-skinned Baron and views the physical world as a collection of fabrics to be manipulated.

- **The Interaction:** She looks at Angelica with undisguised disgust. To her, Angelica is not a person but a "mess" that spoils the aesthetic of Gilded's court.
- **The Insult:** She often offers to "drape something over that mess," using a tone that implies Angelica is trash that needs to be concealed to avoid offending the Baron's eyes.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 10: The Gala of Ghosts](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L838-854)
- **Defining Quote:** "A clumsy mistake, Velour. But perhaps you will find inspiration in the manual labor of the lower decks." (Reveals flaw: ENVY)
