### Scene 1: The Geometry

- **Key Event:** The Entity manifests. It is a shape that hurts to look at—a non-Euclidean object that shifts between a sphere, a pyramid, and nothing.
- **Key Event:** It doesn't speak. It transmits pure data. Angelica's nose starts bleeding in the real world.

### Scene 2: The Assessment

- **Key Event:** The Entity analyzes Angelica. It categorizes her as "Anomaly."
- **Key Event:** It tries to delete her. The white room shrinks, trying to crush her.

### Scene 3: The Will

- **Key Event:** She pushes the walls back.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica:** "I am not a file. I am a user. And I have administrator privileges."
