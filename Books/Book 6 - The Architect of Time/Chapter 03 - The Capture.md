## Chapter 3: The Capture

### Scene 1: The Trap / The Clearing

- **Key Event:** The Smilodon is gone. But Angelica isn't safe.
- **Key Event:** She hears a _swish_ in the air.
- **Key Event:** She looks up.
- **Key Event:** Too late.
- **Key Event:** A massive net, woven from thick vines, drops from the canopy.
- **Key Event:** It is heavy. Weighted with rocks.
- **Key Event:** It pins her to the ground.
- **Key Event:** She struggles. The more she moves, the tighter it gets. A Chinese finger trap made of jungle.
- **Key Event:** "Clever," she grunts, trying to reach her knife. "Primitive, but effective."

### Scene 2: The Hunters / The Clearing

- **Key Event:** The bushes part.
- **Key Event:** Six figures step out.
- **Key Event:** They are human. Tall, muscular, covered in body paint and furs.
- **Key Event:** They hold spears tipped with black obsidian.
- **Key Event:** They don't approach recklessly. They encircle her. Spears out. Shields up.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stops struggling.
- **Key Event:** She analyzes them.
- **Key Event:** "Pack tactics," she notes. "Disciplined. Hierarchy. Not random scavengers."
- **Key Event:** They look at her silver flight suit. At her pale skin.
- **Key Event:** One of them pokes her with a spear.
- **Key Event:** "Sky Demon," he mutters.

### Scene 3: The King / The Clearing

- **Key Event:** The circle parts.
- **Key Event:** A giant walks through.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar. The Alpha.
- **Key Event:** He wears a cloak of wolf fur. A necklace of teeth.
- **Key Event:** He stops in front of the net.
- **Key Event:** He looks down at her. His eyes are intelligent, calculating.
- **Key Event:** He sees the titanium shard in her hand.
- **Key Event:** He reaches through the net.
- **Key Event:** Angelica tries to slash him.
- **Key Event:** He catches her wrist. His grip is like iron.
- **Key Event:** He isn't angry. He is bored.
- **Key Event:** He squeezes until she drops the shard.
- **Key Event:** He picks it up. He tests the edge. He nods.
- **Key Event:** "Good metal," he says.
- **Key Event:** He waves his hand. "Meat."
- **Key Event:** Two hunters grab the net and drag her.
- **Key Event:** "Hey!" Angelica shouts. "I am not food! I am Angelica!"
- **Key Event:** Ragnar doesn't look back. "Meat talks," he says. "Demons scream. We will see which you are."
- **Key Event:** "I am not meat!" she yells. "I am the Commander of the Zenith!"
- **Key Event:** "You are in a net," Ragnar corrects without turning around. "So you are prey."

### Scene 4: The Cage / The Cliff Settlement

- **Key Event:** They drag her for miles. Through mud, thorns, and streams.
- **Key Event:** They reach the settlement. A cluster of caves and huts clinging to the cliffside.
- **Key Event:** Fires burn. Mammoths graze in a pen.
- **Key Event:** They dump her into a cage.
- **Key Event:** It isn't made of wood. It is made of ribs. Massive, curved ribs.
- **Key Event:** "Mammoth," she realizes. "Or something bigger."
- **Key Event:** The hunters celebrate. They dance around the cage. They poke sticks at her.
- **Key Event:** "Sky Demon caught!" they chant.
- **Key Event:** Angelica sits in the mud. She looks at the bars.
- **Key Event:** She starts to laugh. A dry, bitter chuckle.
- **Key Event:** "Vane called me a savage once," she tells the empty air. "He said I belonged in the mud."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the tribe. At the raw, brutal life around her.
- **Key Event:** "If he could see me now, he'd die laughing. I've finally found my people, and they put me in a zoo."
- **Key Event:** She leans her head back against a rib-bone.
- **Key Event:** "Well played, universe. Well played."
