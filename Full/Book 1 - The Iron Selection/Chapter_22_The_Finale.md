# Chapter 22: The Finale

> _"The irony of ascension is that the higher you climb, the less you can breathe. The atmosphere of the Zenith is pure, yes, but it is also thin. It demands a different kind of lung. A different kind of heart. Those who cling to the heavy air of the earth will suffocate before they ever see the stars."_

**Scene 1: The Base**

The Spire didn't look like a building. It looked like a needle specifically designed to pierce God's eye.

It rose from the center of the Clockwork City, a single, terrifying spike of obsidian and crystal that vanished into the bruised purple clouds of the Zenith layer. At its base, the air was still thick with the smog of the Foundry, tasting of rust and dead fires. But looking up, the air thinned. It became clear. Cold. Lethal.

Angelica Ward stood at the foot of the staircase.

"Ten thousand," she whispered.

The number felt heavy in her mouth. Ten thousand steps. No elevators. No grav-lifts. Just a spiral of translucent glass winding around the exterior of the tower, exposed to the wind, the cold, and the drop.

"Structural integrity is... questionable," Kaelen Night murmured, tapping the glass railing with the hilt of his blade. It rang with a high, brittle note. "The material is strong, but the anchor points are under excessive torque from the wind shear."

"It's glass," Ria grunted. She was back in her human form, though "human" was a generous term these days. Her skin was a patchwork of grey callouses and healing burns. She looked like a statue that had been dragged through a gravel pit. "Why is it always glass? Why can't the Highborn build anything out of concrete?"

"Transparency," Kaelen said, checking his boot laces. "They want to see us fall."

Angelica looked back at the city.

It was a graveyard. Smoke curled from the ruins of Sector 7. The Crossroads, where they had killed Squad Copper, was just a dark smudge in the distance. The silence of the city was heavy, pressing down on them. The only sound was the wind howling around the base of the Spire, a low, mournful note like a bow drawn across a cello string.

We are leaving it, Angelica thought. We are leaving the rust and the rot and the hunger. But we are taking it with us. The stains on our souls don't wash off.

She looked at Ria. Ria was staring at a pile of scrap metal near the first step—a broken gear from a destroyed Vermin. She kicked it. It skittered across the pavement with a hollow clatter.

"I'm going to miss it," Ria said softly. "The rust."

"Illogical," Kaelen said. "The environment is toxic. Survival probability is below 12% per annum."

"Yeah," Ria smiled, a sad, crooked thing. "But it was _our_ toxic dump, you know? It made sense. The strong eat the weak. Simple." She looked up at the Spire. "Up there... I don't know the rules."

"The rules are identical," Kaelen said. "Only the elevation changes."

"We move," Kaelen said. He didn't look back. He never looked back.

He took the first step.

Ria adjusted the straps of her armor. The servos whined—a high-pitched protest. The suit was damaging itself, grinding its gears to dust, but it was the only thing holding her together.

"Let's get this over with," she muttered, and followed him.

Angelica took a breath. She filled her lungs with the smog one last time. It tasted like home. It tasted like the Silt.

She stepped onto the glass.

---

**Scene 2: The Ascent**

**Step 1,000**

The smog layer was below them now. It looked like a dirty ocean, rolling and churning in slow motion. The sun was brighter here, sharp and unfiltered, glaring off the obsidian wall of the Spire.

Angelica's thighs burned. It was a dull, rhythmic ache that synced with her heartbeat.

_Step. Breath. Step. Breath._

"Pace," Kaelen called from twenty steps ahead. "Do not surge. Efficiency."

**Step 3,400: The Wind Shear**

The wind arrived.

It wasn't a breeze. It was a physical assault. It slammed into them as they cleared the chaotic airflow of the lower towers, a steady, screaming gale that wanted to peel them off the glass.

Angelica grabbed the railing. Her fingers went white. The wind roared in her ears, drowning out the whine of Ria's servos.

"Stay low!" Kaelen shouted, his voice whipped away instantly.

They hunched over, moving like crabs. The drop to their right was absolute. Three thousand feet of empty air. If you fell here, you wouldn't just die. You would have time to think about it. You would have time to regret everything.

Suddenly, the glass beneath Ria's boot cracked.

_CRACK._

"Ria!" Angelica screamed.

A section of the stair—a slab of glass the size of a coffin—detached. It fell, tumbling silently into the void.

Ria scrambled back, her armor sparking against the obsidian wall. She was dangling by one hand, her fingers dug into a microscopic seam in the rock.

"Hold on!" Kaelen lunged. He didn't reach for her hand. He drove his dagger into the obsidian wall above her, creating an anchor point. "Grab the hilt!"

Ria reached up. Her heavy gauntlet slipped on the stone. She groaned, the weight of the Titan-Suit dragging her down.

"I can't!" she yelled. "It's too heavy!"

"Drop the pack!" Angelica yelled, crawling toward them against the wind. "Ria, drop the ammo pack!"

"No!" Ria roared. "We might need it!"

"We need _you_!" Kaelen shouted. It was the first time he had raised his voice in anger. "Drop the load, Stone! That is an order!"

Ria looked at him. Then she hit the release catch.

The ammo crate fell. It spun away, vanishing into the clouds.

Lighter, Ria swung her arm up. Her metal fingers closed around Kaelen's dagger hilt. The steel groaned but held.

Kaelen grabbed her wrist. Angelica grabbed Kaelen's belt.

Together, they heaved.

Ria tumbled back onto the remaining glass. She lay there, gasping, staring at the sky.

"Okay," she wheezed. "Okay. No ammo. We punch things now."

"Ideally," Kaelen said, pulling his dagger free. "We avoid combat entirely."

He looked at Ria. Then he offered her a hand.

"Good grip," he said.

Ria took it. "Good anchor."

**Step 6,200: The Frozen**

They found them on the north face.

At first, Angelica thought they were statues. Gargoyles carved into the glass to scare the climbers.

But gargoyles didn't wear Squad Silver uniforms.

There were three of them. Huddled together in a tight circle against the obsidian wall. They were covered in a layer of clear ice, preserving them perfectly.

"Squad Silver," Kaelen noted. He didn't stop, but he slowed down. "Estimated time of death: twelve hours."

Angelica stopped. She looked at the face of the boy on the left. It was Julian Argent. The Highborn boy who had warned her at the Winter Ball. His eyes were open, staring at nothing. His skin was blue.

"They froze," Angelica whispered.

"Hypothermia," Kaelen corrected. "Their gear was insufficient. They stopped to rest. The wind took their heat."

Ria limped past them. She didn't look at their faces. She looked at their boots.

"Nice boots," she muttered. "Better grip than mine."

"Ria!" Angelica hissed.

"They aren't using them," Ria shrugged. But she didn't stop to take them. She kept moving, dragging her heavy leg.

Angelica lingered. She saw something clutched in Julian's frozen hand. A piece of paper. The wind whipped the corner of it, but the ice held it fast.

She reached out. Her fingers were numb, but she pried the p aper loose. It snapped with a brittle sound.

She unfolded it. The ink was smeared, but legible.

_To Father,_
_We stopped. Just for a minute. The wind is so loud. Tell Mother I tried. Tell her the silver didn't help. The money didn't help. It's just cold. It's all just cold._
_J._

Angelica felt a tear freeze on her cheek.

"Angelica," Kaelen's voice was sharp. "Move. The cold is a predator. If you stop to mourn, you join them."

Angelica crumpled the note. She put it in her pocket. It felt heavy, heavier than the ammo crate Ria had dropped. It was the weight of a life that realized, too late, that the game was rigged.

"He tried to write a letter," Angelica said, her voice shaking. "To his dad so he wouldn't be disappointed."

"Sentiment is inefficient," Kaelen said. But he waited for her. He stood on the step above, blocking the wind with his body until she started moving again.

**Scene 3: The Design (Flashback)**

_Three Months Ago. The Headmaster's Office._

_The office was warm. It smelled of old paper and expensive tea._

_Prelate Vane stood by the window, looking out at the Academy grounds. Below, the candidates were running drills in the rain._

_"The psychological profiles are complete," Lord Cromwell said, placing a thick dossier on the mahogany desk. "This year's crop is... volatile."_

_"Volatility is useful," Vane said, turning around. He took a sip of tea. "If directed."_

_"There is a concern regarding Squad Iron," Cromwell tapped the folder. "The Night boy. The Stone girl. The Ward anomaly. They appear to be forming a genuine bond. Pack dynamics. It's rare in the Selection. Usually, the stress fractures them by Week 2."_

_"A bond is not a flaw, Cromwell," Vane smiled. "A bond is a lever."_

_He walked to the wall, where a holographic schematic of the Spire was displayed._

_"The finale," Vane said softly. "The Extraction Point. We have commissioned a Class-A Luxury Shuttle for the victors. Champagne. Soft seats. Thermal regulation."_

_"Standard protocol," Cromwell nodded._

_"Change it," Vane said._

_He waved his hand. The hologram shifted. The luxury shuttle was replaced by a small, sleek courier craft._

_"A Courier?" Cromwell raised an eyebrow. "That's a two-seater. Pilot and cargo. Or two passengers."_

_"Exactly," Vane's eyes glittered. "Two seats."_

_"But the squads are formatted for three," Cromwell said slowly. Then he smiled. It was a cold, sharp smile. "Ah. I see."_

_"We sell them the dream of the squad," Vane whispered. "We tell them that unity is strength. We let them bleed for each other. We let them save each other. We let them love each other."_

_He touched the hologram of the tiny shuttle._

_"And then, at the very end... we ask them to do the math."_

_"Cruel," Cromwell noted. "The audience will love it."_

_"It isn't cruelty, Cromwell," Vane said, sitting back down. "It is metallurgy. You cannot forge true iron without first burning away the impurities. And the greatest impurity of all... is love."_

---

**Scene 3.5: The Betting Floor**

_The Gilded Hall. Tier 1._

_Lady Corinne stood on the balcony overlooking the Betting Floor. It was chaos._

_A thousand Highborn lords and ladies were screaming, waving credit chits, and watching the massive screens that floated above the pit. The air smelled of expensive perfume and nervous sweat._

_"Iron! Five thousand on Iron!"_

_"Silver is out! The Blue-Bloods are dead! Sell! Sell!"_

_"Putting everything on the Night boy! He's a killer! Look at his eyes!"_

_Corinne sipped her champagne. It was crisp. Cold._

_Lord Cromwell appeared beside her. He looked pleased._

_"The ratings are unprecedented," he said. "The entire city is watching. They want to know who falls."_

_"They want blood," Corinne corrected. "They don't care who falls, as long as the splash is big enough."_

_"I see you are holding your position," Cromwell nodded at the betting slate in her hand. "You still believe in the Ward girl?"_

_"I believe in variables," Corinne said. "And she is the only one I cannot calculate."_

_On the main screen, the camera zoomed in on the Spire. Three tiny figures were crawling up the glass like ants on a needle._

_"The shuttle is approaching," Cromwell said, checking his watch. "The Two-Seat Protocol is active. Vane's little joke."_

_"It's not a joke," Corinne murmured. "It's a test."_

_"A test of what? Survival?"_

_"No," Corinne looked at Angelica on the screen. "A test of character. Survival is easy, Cromwell. Any animal can survive. But to remain human while doing it? That is the trick."_

_She tapped her slate._

_"Double my wager," she told the broker. "On Squad Iron. All of them."_

_"But my lady," the broker stammered. "The odds of a full squad victory are... zero. The shuttle physics..."_

_"I don't care about physics," Corinne smiled. It was a sharp, dangerous smile. "I'm betting on the Mechanic."_

---

**Scene 4: The Summit**

**Step 10,000**

The last step was the hardest. Not because of the steepness, but because of what it meant.

It meant it was over.

Angelica dragged herself up the final riser. She rolled onto the flat surface of the summit.

It was a circle of black obsidian, fifty meters across, polished to a mirror shine. It reflected the sky—a deep, endless violet that was fading into the black of true space. The stars were visible here, hard and bright like diamonds.

The wind stopped. Or maybe the platform was shielded. It was suddenly silent.

Solemn.

Ria collapsed next to her. She tore her helmet off. Her hair was matted with sweat and blood, but she was grinning. A wild, broken grin.

"We did it," she rasped. "We actually did it."

Kaelen walked to the center of the platform. He stood there, looking up at the sky. He didn't smile. But his shoulders, usually so tight with tension, finally relaxed.

"Sector Clear," he said softly. "Hostiles eliminated. Objective complete."

Angelica sat up. She looked at them.

They were a mess. Ria's armor was scrap metal. Kaelen's cloak was a rag. She herself felt like a collection of bruises held together by sheer stubbornness.

But they were alive. And more importantly, they were together. The bond Vane had mocked, the "impurity" he sought to burn away, was the only reason they were standing there.

"We're a squad," Angelica said. The words felt huge. "We're Iron."

"Damn right," Ria laughed. It was a wet, ragged sound. "Highborns can kiss my metal ass. We beat the house."

"The extraction," Kaelen pointed.

Above them, the clouds parted.

A shuttle descended. It was sleek, white, and silent. It looked like a dove descending from heaven. Anti-grav engines hummed with a low, soothing thrum.

It landed in the center of the obsidian circle. The landing gear touched down without a sound.

The ramp hissed open.

Light spilled out—warm, golden light. It smelled of sterilized air and lavender.

And then, the hologram flickered to life.

A fifty-foot tall projection of Headmaster Vane appeared above the ship. He was smiling. It was the smile of a proud father.

"Squad Iron," his voice boomed, echoing perfectly in the silent air. "Welcome to the Zenith."

Ria stood up. She helped Angelica to her feet. They stood together, arm in arm, Kaelen flanking them. A phalanx.

"You have exceeded all variables," Vane continued. "You have proven that Iron is stronger than flesh. You have won the Selection."

The crowd noise washed over them—a roar of millions of citizens cheering from their living rooms, piped in through the audio system. It was intoxicating.

"However," Vane's smile faltered. Just a fraction. A performance of regret.

"We have encountered a minor logistical anomaly."

Angelica felt a cold knot form in her stomach. It wasn't the hunger. It was instinct.

"The extraction shuttle," Vane gestured to the sleek white craft. "Is a courier class. Optimized for speed."

He paused.

"It has a maximum life-support capacity... for two."

The silence returned. It was louder than the wind. Louder than the crowd.

Angelica looked at the shuttle.

Two seats.

She looked at Ria. Ria was blinking, her brain trying to process the words, trying to make them fit into the victory she had just built.

She looked at Kaelen.

Kaelen wasn't blinking.

He was looking at the shuttle. Then he looked at Ria. Then he looked at Angelica.

His hand drifted to his belt. To the hilt of his blade.

The math was done.

"Oh no," Angelica whispered.

---

**Scene 5: The Twist**

"Two?" Ria repeated. The word sounded foreign in her mouth. She looked at the shuttle, then at Vane's hologram. "But... we're a squad. We finished together. That's the rule."

"The rule," Vane said, his voice smooth as oil, "was that the _strongest_ survive. Squads are a mechanism for maximizing survival probability during the ascent. You have ascended. The mechanism is now obsolete."

Vane leaned forward, the hologram looming over them.

"Think of it as the final exam," he said. "The Iron Selection does not produce teams. It produces leaders. And a leader must know how to make difficult resource allocation decisions."

A red digital timer materialized in the air above the platform.

**05:00**

"You have five minutes," Vane said. "If the passenger manifest is not confirmed by zero... the shuttle leaves empty. And the platform sanitization protocols engage."

"Sanitization?" Angelica asked.

"Plasma purge," Kaelen said correctly. "To sterilize the site for the next cycle."

"Five minutes," Vane repeated. "Do try to be efficient."

The hologram froze, watching them. The crowd noise dipped, replaced by a low, rhythmic thrumming sound. A heartbeat.

**04:45**

The wind on the platform seemed to die. The silence was absolute.

Ria took a step back. She looked at Kaelen.

"Kaelen?" she said. Her voice was small. "Why is your hand on your sword?"

Kaelen didn't move. He stood perfectly still, his eyes locked on Ria's chest piece—the thickest part of her armor, but also where the damaged servos were exposed.

"Variables have changed," Kaelen said. His voice was devoid of inflection. It was the voice of the machine. "Resource scarcity necessitates a reduction in personnel. Three units. Two slots. One unit is redundant."

"Redundant?" Ria's voice rose. "I carried you! I carried both of you up the last thousand steps! My leg is metal pasta because of you!"

"Past performance is irrelevant," Kaelen said. "The criteria is future utility. I am the blade. You are the hammer. Hammers are heavy. And easily dodged."

"Kaelen, stop," Angelica stepped between them. She held her hands up. "This is what he wants. Look at him! He's watching us like we're bacteria in a petri dish!"

"He is the Gamemaker," Kaelen looked at her. "He sets the parameters. We play the game."

"We don't have to play!" Angelica yelled. "We can refuse! If we all stay, he can't kill us all! It would ruin the finale!"

"Incorrect," Kaelen said. "Martyrdom is a valid ending arc for the audience. Tragedy sells. If we stay, we burn. If we fight, two survive. Two is greater than zero."

**03:30**

The timer ticked down.

Ria's face hardened. Usefulness. That was the only currency she had ever known. And now, she was being told she was bankrupt.

"You think you can take me, Night?" she growled. The air around her began to shimmer. Magic. Earth magic. Even exhausted, her connection to the stone was absolute. "I'm a Titan. I'll snap you in half."

"You are damaged," Kaelen analyzed. "Hydraulic pressure is at 40%. Reaction time is compromised. You favor your left leg. I will sever your hamstring, then pierce the throat. Estimated combat time: 12 seconds."

He drew his blade.

_Schwing._

The sound was shockingly loud.

---

**Scene 5.5: The Choice**

_Kaelen's Internal Monologue._

_Target: Ria Stone (Titan-Class)._
_Status: Compromised._
_Threat Level: High (Initial Burst Only)._

_The logic was sound. It was clean. It was pure._

_Two seats. Three candidates. The weak link must be severed._

_It was what his father would do. It was what Vane expected. It was what the Iron philosophy demanded._

_So why was his hand shaking?_

_He looked at Ria. He saw the grey skin. The exhausted eyes. But he also saw the hand reaching out on the glass cliff. He felt the grip on his wrist. "I got you."_

_Memory file accessed: The Foundry. Ria fighting the Chimera. Protecting him._
_Memory file accessed: The Campfire. Ria sharing her last water ration._
_Memory file accessed: The Bonding. Ria naming him "Shadow."_

_Error. Logic conflict. Emotional attachment detected._

_Delete._

_He tried to delete it. He tried to purge the files. But they were read-only. They were burned into his core._

_He looked at Angelica. She was crying. She was pleading._

_"Step aside, Mechanic," he said. But his voice lacked conviction._

_He wasn't killing Ria because she was weak. He was killing her because if he didn't... Angelica would die._

_That was the new variable._

_He wasn't protecting himself. He was protecting the Mechanic._

_And if becoming a monster was the price of her survival... he would pay it._

_He tightened his grip on the blade._

_"I am securing the asset," he whispered._

_Then he lunged._

---

**Scene 6: The Standoff**

It wasn't a fight. It was an execution attempt interrupted by a natural disaster.

Kaelen moved like smoke. He was under Ria's guard before she could even raise her fists. His blade flashed, aiming for the gap in her armor at the knee.

But Ria didn't block. She screamed.

It was a primal roar of rage and betrayal. She slammed her foot onto the obsidian.

_BOOM._

The platform shook. A crack spiderwebbed from her boot, shooting straight toward Kaelen.

Stone spikes erupted from the floor—obsidian shrapnel exploding upward.

Kaelen twisted in mid-air. He bounced off a rising spike, spinning away.

"You want to cut me?" Ria roared. Her skin turned grey. Rock coated her arms. The Titan-Form. She was burning her life force to fuel it. "Come on then! I'll grind you to dust!"

She charged. She was a freight train.

Kaelen didn't meet her head-on. He slid. He ducked. He danced.

He slashed at her back as she passed. Sparks flew.

"Stop it!" Angelica screamed.

She looked around. She needed a lever. She needed a fulcrum.

She looked at the timer. **02:15**.

She looked at the shuttle.

She ran.

Not toward the fight. Toward the ship.

"Angelica, get inside!" Kaelen yelled, parrying a massive stone fist. The impact drove him to his knees.

"I am!" Angelica yelled back.

She ran up the ramp. She dove into the cockpit.

---

**Scene 6.5: The Hack**

The cockpit was silent, efficient, and dead.

It was white leather and brushed chrome. It smelled like a new car.

Angelica threw herself into the pilot's seat. It molded to her spine, soft and yielding—a stark contrast to the hard glass of the stairs.

She looked at the control panel.

It was a standard Imperial interface—smooth, black glass with holographic overlays.

"System," she commanded. "Manual override."

"Voice authorization required," the computer purred. It had a female voice, polite and indifferent. "Please state your designation."

"Candidate Ward. Squad Iron."

"Access denied. Pre-flight protocols are locked by Gamemaker Authority. Please wait for passenger confirmation."

"I don't have time to wait!" Angelica slammed her fist on the dash.

Outside, the ship shook. Ria had just slammed Kaelen into the hull.

Angelica took a deep breath.

"Okay," she whispered. "Technomancy. Rule one. If you can't pick the lock, kick down the door."

She reached under the dash. Her fingers found the maintenance panel. She popped the latch.

It fell open, revealing the guts of the machine.

Fiber-optics. Bio-gel relays. Crystal matrices.

It was beautiful.

"Hello, gorgeous," Angelica murmured. She pulled out her multi-tool.

She didn't need to understand the encryption. She just needed to trick the sensors.

The system used 'Avian-Logic'—a Base-12 quaternary code based on flow states rather than binary on/off. To hack it, you didn't just need to change a zero to a one. You had to change the river's course.

She found the weight sensor relay—a blue bundle of fibers connected to the landing gear. It was pulsing with a steady rhythm. _Thump-thump. Thump-thump._

"You think we're heavy?" she asked the wires. "Let's change your mind."

She cut the blue wire.

The pulse stopped.

"Warning," the computer chirped. "Sensor failure. Defaulting to safety protocols. Engine lockout."

"No, no, no," Angelica hissed. "Don't lock out. Bypass."

She grabbed a red wire—the power feed for the cabin lights—and stripped it. She twisted it around the cut end of the blue wire.

She jumped the power directly into the sensor input. But it was raw current. It was jagged.

"Signal mismatch," the computer stated. "Input rejected."

Angelica grabbed her own glove. She pulled a tiny copper coil from the wrist mechanism—a stabilizer from her old rig. She inserted it between the red and blue wires.

The coil hummed. It smoothed the jagged current into a steady wave. A fake heartbeat.

"Recalibrating," the computer said, sounding confused. "Weight detected: -500 pounds."

"Negative five hundred? Anti-gravity assist active," the computer decided. "Perfect. We're floating."

Now, the passenger count.

She found the life-support regulator. It was a green crystal matrix pulsing with light. It measured the CO2 output to determine how many people were breathing.

Two breathers allowed. Three breathers meant shutdown.

Angelica looked at the matrix. It was a complex lattice of light. If she cut it, the ship would vent the atmosphere to space.

"Think," she whispered. "Think like Aris."

Life support measured distinct biological signatures. It looked for _intervals_.

She reached into her pocket. She pulled out the chronometer Kaelen had given her. It was ticking. A simple, rhythmic pulse. _Tick. Tick. Tick._

She jammed the chronometer _into_ the bio-gel of the regulator.

The gel hissed. The ticking slowed. The mechanical rhythm interfered with the biological scan. It created a harmonious interference pattern.

"System scan," she commanded.

"Scanning..." the computer paused. "Two biological signatures detected. And... one anomaly. Classifying anomaly as... background noise."

"Yes!" Angelica shouted.

She looked out the viewport.

Vane was watching. The fighting had stopped.

Kaelen was on the ground. Ria was standing over him, a fist raised.

"Time to go," Angelica whispered.

She grabbed the microphone.

"HEY!"

---

**Scene 7: The Escape**

Angelica's voice boomed over the external speakers.

Ria and Kaelen froze.

Angelica stood at the top of the ramp, holding the sparking wires like a weapon.

"Stop fighting," she said calmLy. "Or I blow the ship."

Vane's hologram leaned in. "Candidate Ward. Destruction of Imperial Property is a disqualifying offense."

"Disqualify this," Angelica spat. "I know how this engine works. It's a Gravitic-Drive. If I cross the polarity on the containment field... _boom_. Antimatter event. No shuttle. No platform. No Spire."

She held the wires closer together. A spark jumped.

"Angel," Ria lowered her fist. "You're bluffing."

"Try me," Angelica said. Her eyes were wild. "I'm the Mechanic. I fix things. And this... this is broken. The only way to fix a rigged game is to break the board."

Startled silence.

"You have 45 seconds," Kaelen noted. "Suicide is inefficient."

"Efficiency is boring," Angelica quoted Cromwell, though she didn't know it. "Three seats. We all go. Or nobody goes."

She looked at Vane.

"Your move, Headmaster. You want a winner? Or do you want a crater?"

Vane stared at her. For a moment, the fatherly mask slipped. He looked annoyed. Impressed, but annoyed.

"The shuttle cannot lift three," Vane said. "Physics, Miss Ward. Mass limits."

"Ria," Angelica said. "Strip."

"What?" Ria blinked.

"The armor," Angelica yelled. "It weighs 200 pounds! Drop it!"

Ria didn't hesitate. She disengaged the seals. The heavy plating clamored to the floor. The servos. The power pack. She stood there in her undersuit, shivering, lighter.

"Kaelen," Angelica pointed. "The weapons. All of them."

Kaelen hesitated. Then he sheathed his sword. He unbuckled his belt. He dropped his daggers.

"Weight reduction," he calculated. "Variable adjusted."

"Get in," Angelica commanded. "Now!"

**00:15**

They ran.

Ria grabbed Kaelen by the collar and threw him up the ramp. She jumped in after him.

Angelica jammed the wires back into the console.

"Fly!" she screamed at the autopilot.

The ramp hissed shut.

The engines whined—a high, strained scream.

"Weight warning," the computer chirped. "Capacity exceeded."

"Override!" Angelica punched the button.

The ship lurched. It hovered. It shook.

**00:03**

**00:02**

**00:01**

The platform around them turned white. The plasma purge sequence initiated.

The shuttle dropped.

It didn't fly up. It fell off the side of the Spire.

"We're crashing!" Ria screamed.

"We're falling with style!" Angelica yelled, wrestling the yoke.

The engines caught. The anti-grav kicked in.

The shuttle swooped up, skimming the clouds, just as the summit of the Spire erupted in a pillar of blinding white fire.

They watched it burn on the rear monitor.

Silence in the cockpit.

Ria looked at Kaelen. Kaelen looked at his bruised ribs.

"You tried to kill me," Ria said.

"I attempted to secure a victory condition," Kaelen corrected. He touched his side and winced. "You broke three ribs."

"Good," Ria said.

Then she started laughing. It was a hysterical, sobbing laugh.

"We beat the house," she choked out. "We beat the damn house."

Angelica slumped in the pilot's seat. She let go of the yoke. The autopilot stabilized their course toward the Imperial Palace.

She looked at her hands. They were shaking.

She had threatened to blow up a spaceship. She had threatened the Headmaster.

She smiled.

"Iron," she whispered.

---

**Scene 7.5: The Landing**

The shuttle touched down on the private landing pad of the Imperial Palace. It was a soft landing, the anti-grav engines humming a gentle lullaby.

The ramp lowered.

The air here was different. It didn't smell of smog or rust or ozone. It smelled of jasmine and ozone-scrubbed sterility. It was the scent of money. The scent of power that had been laundered clean.

Squad Iron stumbled out.

They were a stark contrast to the white marble and gold leaf of the landing pad. They were dirty, bloody, and bruised. Ria was in her undersuit, her grey skin exposed and vulnerable. Kaelen was weaponless, his combat cloak torn to ribbons. Angelica was covered in grease and soot, her hands stained with the blood of the machine she had just butchered.

A line of Imperial Guards stood at attention. They wore ceremonial gold armor that looked like it had never seen a fight. Their plumes were pristine white ostrich feathers. They looked at the squad like they were looking at something the cat dragged in.

Behind them, a man stepped forward.

He wasn't Vane. He was older, perhaps sixty, but built like a fortress. His uniform was simple grey wool, unadorned except for a single iron rank pip on the collar. His face was a map of scars, a history of violence written in skin, and one eye was a glowing red optic that whirred softly as it focused.

General Ironwood. The Fist of the Emperor.

He looked at the three of them. He looked at the battered shuttle, steam still hissing from its overheated engines. He looked at the burning Spire in the distance, a pillar of fire against the darkening sky.

"Squad Iron," he rumbled. His voice was deep, resonant, like grinding stones deep underground.

Kaelen straightened. It was a reflex. He snapped a salute, despite his broken ribs, his posture perfect. "Sir. Reporting for duty."

Ironwood walked down the line. He didn't return the salute. He stopped in front of Angelica. He looked at her hands, still clutching the multi-tool.

"You bypassed a Class-A encryption in under two minutes," Ironwood said. It wasn't a question. "And you jumpered a gravitic drive with... copper wire?"

"It was a rush job, sir," Angelica said, her voice trembling slightly. She tried to hide the tool behind her back. "I can do better."

Ironwood didn't smile. But his human eye narrowed, and for a second, there was a flicker of something that wasn't contempt. Respect? Amusement?

"I'm sure you can," he said.

He turned to the guards, dismissing their disgust with a wave of his hand.

"Get them to the infirmary. Then get them fed. Real food. Protein. Greens. They look like they haven't eaten in a month."

"Forty days, sir," Ria corrected, swaying slightly on her feet.

Ironwood looked at her. He looked at the grey skin of the Titan-user, the mark of the Deep Earth magic.

"Welcome to the Legion, candidate," he said softly. "Get some sleep. You'll need it."

He turned and walked away, his boots echoing on the marble.

As they were led toward the palace doors—massive, golden doors that promised warmth and safety—Angelica looked back one last time.

High above the clouds, a silver bird was circling the burning Spire. It flashed once in the sunlight, a spark of defiance against the dying day, then vanished into the upper atmosphere.

_Aeon._

Angelica smiled. Her first real smile in forty days.

_See you soon, partner._

**Scene 8: The Observer**

_Aeon watched the white bird fly away._

_He sat on the railing of the burning platform. The plasma fire roared around him, but he was Phase-Shifted. The heat didn't touch him._

_He recorded the data._

_Probability of Survival: 0.004%._
_Outcome: Success._

_The Creator (Angelica) had introduced a new variable. "Martyrdom." She had gambled infinity against zero._

_It was illogical. It was inefficient. It was beautiful._

_Aeon spread his wings. He didn't follow the shuttle. The shuttle was going to the Palace. That was a cage._

_He looked down at the city. At the Undercity._

_There was work to be done. The Creator had fixed the immediate problem. But the Machine was still broken._

_Aeon dove._

_He fell into the smog, a silver spark in the darkness._

_The Selection was over._
_The War had just begun._
