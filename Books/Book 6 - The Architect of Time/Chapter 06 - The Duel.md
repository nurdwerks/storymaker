## Chapter 6: The Duel

### Scene 1: The Challenge / The Cage

- **Key Event:** It is noon. The sun is hot.
- **Key Event:** Torin is drawing diagrams in the dirt outside Angelica's cage. They are discussing structural engineering.
- **Key Event:** A shadow falls over them.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar.
- **Key Event:** He kicks the dirt, erasing the math.
- **Key Event:** "Sorcery," he growls.
- **Key Event:** Torin stands up. "It is knowledge, Alpha."
- **Key Event:** "It is poison," Ragnar spits. "You talk to the demon clearly. You are forgetting your place, Shaman."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar grabs the cage door. He rips the bindings.
- **Key Event:** He reaches in and drags Angelica out by her hair.
- **Key Event:** She yelps but doesn't scream. She lands in the dust.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar throws a knife at her feet. Obsidan blade. Bone handle.
- **Key Event:** "Stand," he commands. "If you are a demon, use your magic. If you are meat, bleed."
- **Key Event:** The tribe gathers. A circle forms.

### Scene 2: The Assessment / The Circle

- **Key Event:** Angelica picks up the knife. It feels light. Too light.
- **Key Event:** She looks at Ragnar. Seven feet tall. Three hundred pounds of muscle.
- **Key Event:** She is five-eight. malnutritioned. Exhausted.
- **Key Event:** "Physical mismatch," she mutters. "Strength differential: 4 to 1. Reach advantage: 12 inches."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar cracks his knuckles. He grins. It is a wolf's grin.
- **Key Event:** "Fight," he says.
- **Key Event:** Angelica takes a breath. She shifts her stance. Low center of gravity.
- **Key Event:** She isn't a warrior. She is an engineer.
- **Key Event:** "He's a heavy object," she tells herself. "Heavy objects have inertia. Use it."
- **Key Event:** She waits. She doesn't attack. She calculates.

### Scene 3: The Fight / The Circle

- **Key Event:** Ragnar charges. He is a freight train.
- **Key Event:** He swings a massive club.
- **Key Event:** Angelica doesn't block. She drops.
- **Key Event:** The club whistles over her head.
- **Key Event:** She rolls between his legs.
- **Key Event:** She pops up behind him.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar spins, roaring. The momentum carries him wide.
- **Key Event:** Angelica spots a loose mammoth rib—part of the cage structure—sticking out of the ground.
- **Key Event:** She waits for his next charge.
- **Key Event:** He lunges.
- **Key Event:** She steps aside at the last fraction of a second.
- **Key Event:** She kicks the back of his knee.
- **Key Event:** _Buckle._
- **Key Event:** Ragnar stumbles. His weight carries him forward.
- **Key Event:** He trips over the mammoth rib.
- **Key Event:** He crashes face-first into the cliff wall. _CRUNCH._
- **Key Event:** The sound echoes through the valley.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar slides down the wall. He is dazed. Blood trickles from his nose.

### Scene 4: The Mercy / The Circle

- **Key Event:** The tribe gasps. The Alpha is down.
- **Key Event:** Angelica is on him instantly.
- **Key Event:** She presses the obsidian knife to his throat.
- **Key Event:** Ragnar freezes. He stares up at her. He expects death.
- **Key Event:** "Do it," he hisses. "Finish it."
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the knife. Then at the tribe.
- **Key Event:** She sees Torin watching her.
- **Key Event:** If she kills him, she is the new Alpha. But she is also a killer. A savage.
- **Key Event:** "No," she says.
- **Key Event:** She pulls the knife back.
- **Key Event:** "Force is mass times acceleration," she says, loud enough for everyone to hear. "You have the mass. I have the acceleration. I did the math. You didn't."
- **Key Event:** She stands up. She offers him the knife, handle first.
- **Key Event:** "Can we stop playing now?" she asks, bored. "I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I want to go back to sleep. Take the knife, Ragnar. Before I change my mind."
- **Key Event:** Ragnar takes the knife. He stands up slowly.
- **Key Event:** He looks at her with a new expression. Not fear. Respect.
- **Key Event:** "You fight with your head," he says.
- **Key Event:** "It's the hardest part of me," Angelica replies.
