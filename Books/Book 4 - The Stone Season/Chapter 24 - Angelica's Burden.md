## Chapter 24: Angelica's Burden

### Scene 1: The Night Watch

- **Key Event:** The setting.
- **Detailed Description:** It is the middle of the "night" cycle on the rebel ship. The lights are dimmed to a low red combat-ready glow. Angelica sits on a narrow catwalk suspended over the primary ventilation shaft of the Engineering deck. The massive fans below rotate with a rhythmic, hypnotic _thrum-thrum-thrum_. The air is warm and smells of recycled oil and ozone. She is shivering, not from cold, but from exhaustion.

- **Key Event:** The accounting.
- **Detailed Description:** She holds a datapad in her lap. On the screen is a list of names. Casualties. Pip, the young signal runner who took a plasma bolt meant for her. Lord Vermillion, who stayed behind to hold the door. Torque, the mechanic who blew the bridge. The list is getting longer. Every name weighs a thousand tons. She traces the letters of Pip's name with her thumb, the screen cool against her skin.

### Scene 2: The Weight

- **Key Event:** The drift.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica closes her eyes for a moment, just resting. The rhythmic sound of the fans begins to change. It morphs into the sound of a heart monitor beeping. _Beep... beep... beep._ She opens her eyes. The catwalk is gone. She is back in the white room of the Zenith hospital.

- **Key Event:** The hallucination.
- **Detailed Description:** Leo is standing there. Not the sick Leo in the bed, but the healthy Leo from her memories. He looks sad. He wears his old Undercity rags, stained with grease.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo (Vision):** "You're tired, Angie."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm fine. I just... I need to figure out the route to the Foundation."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo (Vision):** "You're trying to save everyone. You can't. You're not a saint, Angie. You never were. Saints get martyred. You need to be a soldier."

- **Key Event:** The lesson.
- **Detailed Description:** Leo steps closer. His eyes turn silver—Vane's eyes.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Leo (Vision):** "Vane was right. You have to be harder. You have to be cold. Or you'll break, and everyone behind you will die. Stop trying to be their friend. Be their Captain."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She faces the internal conflict of leadership. She wants to be "Angie," the silt-rat who fixes toasters and loves her friends. But the war needs "Ward," the Commander who spends lives like currency. She realizes she has to kill Angie to let Ward live.

### Scene 3: The Pride

- **Key Event:** The confession.
- **Detailed Description:** The vision snaps. Zephyr and Ria are standing on the catwalk. They found her staring into the abyss. Zephyr looks concerned; Ria looks stoic. They sit down on the grating beside her. Angelica doesn't look at them. She stares at the spinning blades below.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I'm turning to stone. I can feel it. When Pip died... I didn't cry. I just checked his ammo count and redistributed it. I'm becoming him. I'm becoming Vane."

- **Key Event:** The validation.
- **Detailed Description:** Ria places a heavy hand on Angelica's shoulder.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You're not Vane. Vane enjoys the math. You hate it. That's the difference. But you still have to do the math."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I have to be Ward. The one who sends people to die. The one who cuts her own arm to feed the beast."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Vane would be proud. That's what he wanted. A weapon. But weapons protect people too."

- **Key Event:** The acceptance.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica wipes her face. Her hand comes away dry. She has no tears left. She accepts the burden. She effectively adopts Vane's "end justifies the means" philosophy, but filters it through her own loyalty.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Accepts her new persona as "Ward, the Commander," rejecting her past identity.

### Scene 4: Joyce's End

- **Key Event:** The collapse.
- **Detailed Description:** A medical alert chimes on Angelica's comms. It's Hatcher. "Get to Med-Bay. It's Joyce." They run. When they arrive, Joyce—the sweet, confused old woman who "knitted" with sharpened stilettos—is lying on a bio-bed. She isn't injured. She is simply... fading. Her mind, fractured by years of torture and the stress of the escape, has finally given out. The connection is severed.

- **Key Event:** The final moments.
- **Detailed Description:** Lady Corinne is kneeling beside the bed, holding Joyce's withered hand. Joyce's eyes are open, but they are wandering. There is no recognition. The "The Needle" is gone; only a scared old woman remains.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce (weakly):** "The tea is... ready. Would you... like some? I think... I put too much sugar."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne (weeping):** "No, Joyce. The tea is perfect. It's the best tea I've ever had."

- **Key Event:** The fading resonance.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher stands in the doorway. He touches the scar on his temple. He feels the sudden, massive "hollow" of Joyce's final memory burning away. A resonance node is going dark. He realizes she is lost in the drift.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher (softly):** "The tea is hot, Joyce. And the door is locked. We're safe, aren't we?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "Safe. Yes. That's the word. Safe."

- **Key Event:** The legacy.
- **Detailed Description:** Before the light fades entirely, Joyce fumbles with her sash. She pulls out her knitting needles—long, deadly titanium spikes. She presses them into Corinne's hands. Her grip is surprisingly strong for a moment, then goes slack.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce (last words):** "You were never silly, Corinne. You were just... waiting. Make them bleed, dear."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Lady Corinne** — She is shattered. She takes the stilettos. She looks at the dead woman who was her only true friend in the high court. Her grief hardens into cold, sharp steel. She accepts the legacy.

### Scene 5: The Resolve

- **Key Event:** The vow.
- **Detailed Description:** They cover Joyce with a sheet. The room is silent. The death wasn't violent, which makes it worse. It was a chaotic universe claiming a tired soul. Angelica looks at the body. Then she looks at her crew—Hatcher, Corinne, Zephyr, Ria. They are all broken. They are all tired.

- **Key Event:** The stars.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica walks to the viewport. The stars are streaking by as they travel at FTL.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We are not stopping. We are not grieving. Not yet."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I will get us to the Foundation. I will get us to the stars. And if I have to burn everything I am to do it, I will. I will turn this whole galaxy to ash before I let another one of us die for nothing."

- **Key Event:** The internal monologue.
- **Detailed Description:** She touches the headset interface at her temple.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (Internal):** "Heavy is the head that wears the headset. But someone has to wear it. I will carry the weight until it breaks me. And then I'll carry it broken."
