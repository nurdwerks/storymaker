## Chapter 29: The Warning

### Scene 1: The Sky / The Village, Earth (Past)

- **Key Event:** It is the 29th day of charging the Hyper-Core. The tribals are celebrating the harvest.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands on the ridge, looking up. The sky is a deep, bruised blue.
- **Key Event:** Suddenly, a streak of fire tears across the heavens. Not a meteor. It's purple. Ionization.
- **Key Event:** Another streak follows. Then another.
- **Key Event:** "Torin!" she shouts, running down the slope. "Get the telescope!"
- **Key Event:** Torin meets her at the base of the tower. He hands her the scope. She trains it on the sky.
- **Key Event:** Ships. Jagged, ugly ships made of welded scrap and hate. They are burning through the atmosphere, leaving trails of black smoke.
- **Key Event:** Angelica lowers the scope. "They found us."

### Scene 2: The Ships / The Tower

- **Key Event:** She recognizes the lead ship. The _Devourer_. It's a Zenith-class mining frigate, retrofitted with heavy cannons.
- **Key Event:** "Hunter Ships," she says, her voice cold. "Scavengers. They survived the Fall by eating everyone else."
- **Key Event:** "How many?" Torin asks.
- **Key Event:** "Six," Angelica says. "Enough to level this mountain."
- **Key Event:** She looks at the village. The children playing. The elders drying fish. They are soft targets.
- **Key Event:** "We are out of time," she whispers.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We are out of time."

### Scene 3: The Timing / The Village Square

- **Key Event:** A boom shakes the ground. A kinetic rod—a solid tungsten spear dropped from orbit—slams into the mountain peak above them.
- **Key Event:** Rock shatters. An avalanche of dust and boulders rumbles down, stopping just short of the tree line.
- **Key Event:** It wasn't a miss. It was a warning shot.
- **Key Event:** The villagers scream, scattering.
- **Key Event:** Angelica stands firm. "They want the engine," she realizes. "They tracked the Resonance spike. They know we have a way off this rock."
- **Key Event:** "They don't want to destroy us," Torin says. "They want to hijack us."
- **Key Event:** "If they take any of us," Angelica says, checking her rifle, "it will be as livestock."

### Scene 4: The Alarm / The Launch Pad

- **Key Event:** Angelica runs to the control console. "Status!"
- **Key Event:** "Core charge at 99%!" Starla reports. "The field is unstable! If we launch now, we might tear the ship apart!"
- **Key Event:** Another kinetic rod hits, closer this time. The ground heaves.
- **Key Event:** Angelica looks at the sky. The Hunter ships are descending, their landing thrusters firing.
- **Key Event:** She looks at the ship. It's not ready. But neither are they.
- **Key Event:** She hits the big red button. The klaxon wails—a banshee scream that echoes through the valley.
- **Key Event:** "Sound the alarm!" she shouts into the PA system. "Get everyone on board! Leave the supplies! Leave everything!"
- **Key Event:** "We leave in one hour," she says, her voice echoing over the panic. "Ready or not."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Sound the alarm. Get everyone on board. Now. We leave in one hour, ready or not."
