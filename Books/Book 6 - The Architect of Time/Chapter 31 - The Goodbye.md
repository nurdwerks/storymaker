## Chapter 31: The Goodbye

### Scene 1: The Pods / _Aeterna_ Cryo-Deck

- **Key Event:** The Cryo-Deck is cold. Mist rolls across the floor.
- **Key Event:** Rows of silver pods stretch into the darkness. Six hundred of them. The entire population of the valley.
- **Key Event:** Angelica walks down the line. She checks the vitals. Green lights.
- **Key Event:** She stops at a pod. A little girl, Lisbet-7 (an ancestor of the Lisbet she knew), is clutching a stuffed animal made of rabbit fur.
- **Key Event:** The girl looks terrified. "Will it hurt?" she asks.
- **Key Event:** Angelica kneels. "No. It will feel like a nap. A long nap."
- **Key Event:** "Will the monsters be there when I wake up?"
- **Key Event:** Angelica strokes the girl's hair. "No. When you wake up, the sky will be blue again. The monsters will be dust. And we will be free."
- **Key Event:** The girl nods. She trusts the Sky-Woman.
- **Key Event:** Angelica initiates the sequence. The glass frosts over. The girl sleeps.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "When you wake up, the sky will be blue again. The monsters will be dust. And we will be free."

### Scene 2: The Sleep / Cryo-Deck

- **Key Event:** The last heavy seal hisses shut.
- **Key Event:** The room is silent, save for the hum of the cooling units.
- **Key Event:** They are safe. They are cargo now.
- **Key Event:** Angelica feels a crushing weight of responsibility. She is carrying a civilization in her hold.
- **Key Event:** Suddenly, the ship shudders. _BOOM._
- **Key Event:** Dust falls from the ceiling. Ideally, they would launch quietly. Reality has other plans.
- **Key Event:** "Bridge!" she snaps into her comms. "Status!"

### Scene 3: The Check / Bridge

- **Key Event:** Elara is at the tactical station. "Shields are holding at 80%!" she shouts over the alarms.
- **Key Event:** "Who is hitting us?"
- **Key Event:** "Hunters," Elara says. "They didn't wait for nightfall. They landed dropships at the gate. Mechs. Heavy walkers."
- **Key Event:** The viewscreen shows the valley burning. Green laser fire cuts through the smoke.
- **Key Event:** "Where is Torin?" Angelica asks.
- **Key Event:** "He's at the ramp," Elara says. "Holding the line. He says the engines need three more minutes to reach launch thrust."
- **Key Event:** Angelica swears. Three minutes is an eternity.

### Scene 4: The Promise / Cryo-Deck

- **Key Event:** Angelica looks back at the pods one last time.
- **Key Event:** Six hundred lives. Six hundred futures.
- **Key Event:** She places her hand on the bulkhead door.
- **Key Event:** "Sleep tight," she whispers. "See you in the future. I promise I won't let you down."
- **Key Event:** She turns and runs for the turbo-lift. She has a war to finish before she can sleep.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Sleep tight. See you in the future. I promise I won't let you down."
