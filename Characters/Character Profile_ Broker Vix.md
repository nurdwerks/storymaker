## I. Role in the Story

Broker Vix is a high-speed information trader who whispers secrets directly into Baron Gilded’s ear. They operate in a frantic, coded language of stocks, bonds, and debts.

- **The Dynamic:** They share a deep, exclusionary intimacy with Gilded, their heads bent together as they laugh at the misfortune of those they’ve bankrupted.
- **The Stings:** Their effortless connection and shared jargon make Angelica feel profoundly alone, reminding her that she is an outsider to the true power structures of Sector 4.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 10: The Gala of Ghosts](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L838-854)
- **Defining Quote:** "Information is a commodity, Vix. And your data has become corrupted." (Reveals flaw: GREED)
