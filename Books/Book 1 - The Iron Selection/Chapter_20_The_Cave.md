## Chapter 20: The Cave

### Scene 1: The Drag

- **Key Event:** Squad Iron drags Kaelen into a hollowed gear housing cave. The blood pact scar on Angelica's wrist burns—reacting to his fading life force by drawing energy from her.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Angel... he's gone."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Go!"

---

### Scene 2: The Surgery

- **Key Event:** Angelica tears Kaelen's shirt open. The neck wound is a black crater with bubbling skin. She cauterizes with a heated knife, but the necrotic tissue grows back instantly—it's living shadow.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night (delirious):** "Mother... Did I... break it?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "It's not working. It's in the blood."

### Scene 3: The Source

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes medicine won't work on a magical virus. Bodies are meat machines; magic is energy through circuits. She must "hack" it.

- **Key Event:** She places hands on his chest and pushes resonance into him. She sees Code—the geometric lattice of his soul (obsidian and violet light) being eaten by green sludge of Prima-Materia.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance (mentally):** "Let me in, you stubborn prince! Open the door!"

### Scene 4: The Soul-Link

- **Key Event:** Angelica uses the Blood Pact scar as a backdoor key and enters Kaelen's mind. For a moment, they are one circuit—she feels his heartbeat, his vast cold loneliness; he feels her Pride and desperate need to protect Leo.

- **Key Event:** Angelica grabs the virus mentally: Select. Delete. Kaelen screams psychically. The black veins recede; the green sludge vanishes.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You... You were inside."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I deleted the corruption."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "You saw."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "I saw enough. Your shields are impressive. But your firewall has holes."

- **Key Event:** Kaelen notes she said his heartbeat was "annoying." She admits it was too slow.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I will endeavor to accelerate it."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Vance:** "Don't die on me again, Night. I don't do resurrections on a budget."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Understood, Vance. Your bill is noted."
