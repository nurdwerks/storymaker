## Chapter 15: The Dance

### Scene 1: The Tension

- **Key Event:** The ballroom layout.
- **Detailed Description:** The Grand Ballroom of the Zenith Spire is a masterpiece of light and glass. It suspended in the upper atmosphere, the walls transparent to show the stars. However, inside, the room is divided by invisible power lines. House Aurum (Gold) holds the center, their members glittering in actual gold-weave. House Ignis (Fire) occupies the south, radiating heat and aggression. House Night (Shadow) lurks in the corners, silent and watchful. Angelica stands near a refreshment drone, clutching a glass of synth-wine, feeling acutely exposed in her borrowed dress.

- **Key Event:** The confrontation.
- **Detailed Description:** Lady Corinne approaches. She is flanked by two sycophants from House Verdant. Corinne is wearing a dress made of woven light-filaments that shift color with her mood—currently, it is a sharp, aggressive diamond-white. She looks Angelica up and down with open disdain.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "You're contaminating the aesthetic, Ward. You smell like ozone and cheap rations."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "And you smell like desperation and expensive perfume. I wasn't aware 'pretentious' was a protected species, or I would have brought a permit."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "Careful, silt-rat. Return to the gutter. Before I melt that scrap-metal dress to your skin."

### Scene 2: The Rescue

- **Key Event:** The threat.
- **Detailed Description:** Corinne raises a finger. A small orb of superheated plasma forms at the tip. She pretends to stumble, aiming the "accidental" discharge directly at Angelica's face. It is a calculated move—enough to scar, not enough to kill, easily dismissed as a drunken mistake.

- **Key Event:** The interception.
- **Detailed Description:** A black-gloved hand intercepts the plasma orb. It is Kaelen Night. He doesn't block it; he absorbs it. A Null-Field surrounds his hand, drinking the energy into nothingness. The plasma fizzles and dies.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Your control is slipping, Corinne. Discharging plasma in a crowded room? How plebeian."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Corinne:** "She provoked me!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "She exists. That is provocation enough for the insecure. Leave. You are boring me."

- **Key Event:** The dismissal.
- **Detailed Description:** Corinne flushes red (her dress shifting to crimson) and retreats. Kaelen turns to Angelica. He looks her over, not with lust, but with appraisal.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "I collect useful things. You, on the other hand, are merely decorative tonight. Try not to get incinerated. It ruins the carpet."

### Scene 3: The Waltz

- **Key Event:** The invitation.
- **Detailed Description:** The music changes—a complex, mathematical waltz favored by the Highborns. Kaelen extends his hand.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I don't dance."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "It is a waltz, Ward. It is physics. Momentum, torque, and trajectory. You understand physics. Take my hand."

- **Key Event:** The dance.
- **Detailed Description:** She accepts. He pulls her onto the floor. He leads with absolute authority, his grip firm. Angelica finds that her combat training translates surprisingly well. She matches his rhythm, predicting his movements like she predicts a sparring partner. They move through the crowd, a swirl of black and silver.

- **Key Event:** The briefing.
- **Detailed Description:** As they spin, Kaelen speaks low, his voice close to her ear.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "The Selection begins tomorrow. The arena is a machine, Ward. It will try to grind us into paste. I need someone who knows how to break the gears."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Is that what I am? Your wrench?"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Precisely. Do not mistake protection for affection. I am maintaining my equipment. If you slow me down, I will leave you behind."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Understood. And if you try to use me as bait, I'll weld your door shut while you're sleeping."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "Fair terms."

### Scene 4: The Observer

- **Key Event:** The balcony.
- **Detailed Description:** High above, on the VIP balcony, Duke Grey leans on the railing. He is surrounded by his entourage of financial advisors. He sips a glass of vintage water. He watches Kaelen and Angelica.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Duke Grey** — He sees everything as a ledger. People are assets or liabilities.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Duke Grey:** "The Night boy is compromising himself for that Silt-rat. Interesting. He has a weakness."

- **Key Event:** The order.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns to Chamberlain Hives, his chief actuary.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Duke Grey:** "Increase the interest rate on House Night's debt by three percent. And place a side wager on the girl surviving the first round. The odds are long, but the payoff is substantial."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Chamberlain Hives:** "As you command, my lord."

### Scene 5: The Spell

- **Key Event:** The ambush.
- **Detailed Description:** The dance ends. Kaelen bows formally and steps away to speak with an instructor. Angelica turns to leave the floor. Corinne is waiting behind a pillar. She hates being humiliated. She casts a spell at Angelica's back—an Aging Curse. It is a nasty piece of magic, designed to wither the skin and grey the hair instantly. A beam of grey light shoots toward Angelica.

- **Key Event:** The intervention.
- **Detailed Description:** Aeon, disguised as a silver hairpin in Angelica's up-do, senses the chronal disturbance. He wakes up. He opens his beak (microscopically) and creates a tiny singularity. The spell hits the singularity and is eaten.

- **Key Event:** The digestion.
- **Detailed Description:** Aeon converts the stolen time-energy into raw chemical energy and feeds it into Angelica through the hairpin's contact with her scalp.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Aeon (Telepathic):** "Delicious seconds. Spicy."

- **Key Event:** The reaction.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica jolts. She feels a sudden rush of caffeine-like energy. The world sharpens. She spins around, eyes glowing faintly. Corinne gasps, seeing her spell fail. A nearby vase of flowers, caught in the displacement eddy, turns to dust instantly. Kaelen sees the vase disintegrate. He looks at Angelica. He suspects, but says nothing.

- **Key Event:** The exit.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica smiles at Corinne—a feral, dangerous smile.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Did you feel that draft? Someone should close a window."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (Telepathic):** "Good bird."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward (Internal):** "Let the Selection begin. I'm ready to break something."
