## Chapter 19: The Interrogation

### Scene 1: The Wake / The Safehouse

- **Key Event:** Angelica interrogates the bound Joyce in the safehouse parlor.
- **Detailed Description:** The safehouse is a hidden apartment in Sector 7, decorated with faded velvet drapes and antique furniture—a remnant of a bygone era. The atmosphere is surreal. Joyce sits in a high-backed chair, bound not with rope, but with "Null-Iron Silk," a material that dampens Resonance abilities. Despite the bondage, the table is set for high tea. There are cucumber sandwiches (made from synthetic paste) and a pot of Earl Grey. The juxtaposition of torture and etiquette is deliberate. Angelica stands over her, not shouting, but vibrating with the low-frequency hum of the "Captain's Voice." The sound rattles the teacups.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica is testing her new power. She feels the Resonance in her blood, a command authority that bypasses logic and strikes at the biological obedience of the Zenith's crew. She hates using it—it feels like Vane's mind-control—but she needs answers. She forces herself to be cold, to be the Captain.
- **Key Event:** The group watches.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher leans against the wall, eating a sandwich, watching Joyce with professional respect. Zephyr looks uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot. He liked Joyce. Seeing "Grandma" tied up feels wrong, even if she tried to kill them.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Her physical transformation continues. Her eyes glow with a faint golden light when she speaks. She is becoming something other than human.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The tea is lovely, Joyce. Now tell me who ordered the poison."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "You have your mother's eyes, dear. And your father's cruelty. It's a striking combination."

### Scene 2: The Leak / The Reveal

- **Key Event:** Joyce breaks under the pressure of the Command Voice.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica leans in, whispering a command word that hits Joyce like a physical blow. Joyce gasps, her mental barriers shattering. She begins to speak, her voice flat and monotone as the truth spills out. She reveals the hierarchy of the "Shadow Court." The Founders—the heads of the Great Houses—are not descendants; they are the originals. They have used "Body-Hopping" technology to transfer their consciousness into new clones for three hundred years. They are immortal parasites feeding on the ship's resources.
- **Detailed Description:** She reveals the specific threat: Lady Vesper, the Merchant Lord, ordered the hit. Vesper fears that Prelate Vane is getting too close to the "Core Codes." If Vane controls the Core, he controls the Founders' immortality. Vesper wants Angelica dead because Angelica is the "Key"—the biological backup drive for the ship's original command protocols. If the Key is dead, Vane cannot unlock the Core.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a wave of nausea. She is not a person to them; she is a piece of hardware. A biological floppy disk to be destroyed to prevent unauthorized access. The scale of her dehumanization is absolute.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She realizes the true nature of her enemy. They are ghosts. They are stagnation personified.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** "They are ghosts haunting a dying machine. They don't care about the ship, or the people, or the future. They only care about the next body. The next extension."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "So I'm not a threat because of what I'll do. I'm a threat because of what I am."

### Scene 3: The Plan / The Breeding Program

- **Key Event:** Joyce reveals the contingency plan.
- **Detailed Description:** If they cannot kill Angelica, they plan to capture her. Joyce explains the "Breeding Program." They intend to lobotomize Angelica and keep her in a stasis tank, using her as a broodmare to produce a new line of "Keys" that they can condition from birth. They want her genetics without her will.
- **Detailed Description:** The room goes silent. Hatcher stops eating. Zephyr looks sick. The horror of the plan is so visceral it sucks the air out of the room. This is not just political assassination; it is industrial-scale rape and slavery.
- **Internal Conflict:** Something snaps in Angelica. The last shred of the "Noble Lady" dies. The fear evaporates, replaced by a cold, black rage. She realizes that negotiation is impossible. You cannot negotiate with a cancer. You cut it out.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — The transition from victim to revolutionary is complete. She decides that she will not just survive; she will burn their world down.

### Scene 4: The Threshold / The Choice

- **Key Event:** Hatcher proposes a counter-move.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher steps forward. He suggests that if Angelica is the Key, she can do more than just unlock the door; she can change the locks. He suggests she take the "Interface Throne" herself. Not to give the codes to Vane, but to override everyone. To seize the ship.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica looks at her hands. She sees the power there. She thinks of the Urchins in the sewer, of Joyce's betrayal, of her mother's death. She realizes that power is the only shield. If she wants to be safe, she must be the Queen.
- **Key Event:** Angelica accepts her destiny.
- **Detailed Description:** She unties Joyce. She tells Joyce that the "Sleeper" is dead. She offers Joyce a new job: not as a sleeper agent for the ghosts, but as a knight for the new Queen. Joyce rubs her wrists, looking at Angelica with a mix of fear and awe. She nods.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She officially declares war on the Founders. She intends to move from a hunted piece on the board to the player moving the pieces.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "You can run, or you can rule. There is no middle ground."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I am not a player. And I am definitely not the ball. I am the landslide. And I’m about to bury them both. Vane. Vesper. All of them."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Long live the Queen. God help us all."

### Scene 5: The Watch

- **Key Event:** Ria maintains the perimeter.
- **Detailed Description:** While the interrogation unfolds inside, **Ria (The Iron Vanguard)** stands guard at the safehouse's rear entrance, her armor powered down to conserve energy but her weapon ready. She can hear fragments of Joyce's confession through the thin walls—the body-hopping, the breeding program, the horror of what they planned for Angelica. Her hands tighten on her rifle. She has fought in riots and put down murderers, but this systematic evil is something different. When Angelica emerges with the declaration of war, Ria is ready. She doesn't need convincing. She needs a target.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria (to Angelica as she exits):** "I heard. The breeding program. If you're going to war, I'm your heavy cavalry. Point me at something."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Welcome to the revolution, Ria. You're promoted to siege engine."
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Ria** — Her commitment to justice transforms into commitment to revolution; she cannot serve a system that would do this.
