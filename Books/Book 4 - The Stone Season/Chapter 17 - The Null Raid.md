# Chapter 17: The Null Raid

---

### Scene 1: The Breach

- **Key Event:** Vane’s "Nulls" (cyborg enforcers) launch a surprise raid on the Scrapyard using high-pressure steam cutters to slice through the reinforced bulkheads.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "They’re not using guns. They’re using the ship against us. They’ve bypassed the safety valves!"

### Scene 2: The Silence

- **Key Event:** Kaelen engages the Nulls in close combat, discovering that they fight with absolute silence and emotionless efficiency, making them harder to predict than the Blighted.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Kaelen Night** — Realizes that the Nulls have no "shadow" in the resonance-sense, meaning his typical combat instincts are failing him.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Kaelen Night:** "There's no heartbeat. No rhythm. It's like fighting a door."

- **Key Event:** **The Mongrel** dies defending the gate from the Nulls. He takes a spear to the chest but kills his attacker before falling, dying in absolute silence.

### Scene 3: The Loss

- **Key Event:** During the skirmish, a significant portion of the survivors they had gathered in previous chapters are killed or captured to be used as raw material for new Nulls.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Witnesses the abduction of a child refugee and is forced to prioritize the group’s escape over a rescue attempt.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We can't save them. The vents are closing. We have to go. Do you hear me? GO!"

### Scene 4: The Evacuation

- **Key Event:** The group uses a dangerous gravity-well shaft to drop several levels instantly, narrowly escaping the Null squad, though Hatcher’s bunker is completely destroyed.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Hatcher** — Watches his life's work vanish in a fireball, but turns away without a word, his focus shifting entirely to the mission.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "It’s just metal, kid. Metal can be replaced. Blood can’t."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "They were perfectly synchronized. Vane has achieved a local mesh network. We are outmatched."

- **Key Event:** **Scrap** plugs himself into the console to absorb a "Logic-Spike" virus meant for Hatcher, sacrificing his personality matrix to save his creator.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Scrap:** "Beep-whirrr-sad-click."
