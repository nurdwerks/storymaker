# Chapter 18: Aris's Experiment

---

### Scene 1: The Captive

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "You brought a monster into our camp? Are you trying to get us killed, Doctor?"

---

### Scene 2: The Observation

- **Key Event:** Aris demonstrates that the Blighted is reacting to a specific low-frequency hum coming from the walls—the "Song" of the Mother.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Dr. Aris** — Displays an unsettling clinical detachment, ignoring the creature's pain to measure its pulse.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Just a moment. I need to measure the tensile strength output. The muscle density must be... SNAP. The bars broke."

### Scene 3: The Tragedy

- **Key Event:** The creature breaks loose and kills a young boy named **Pip**, who had been following Lisbet.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Slaps the notebook out of Aris’s hand during his attempt to document the boy’s death as "data."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Unfortunate variable. But the data confirms the muscle density is 300% of human norm. The child was... collateral."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "You killed a child. You let it out. You played god and a boy is dead."

### Scene 4: The Threat

- **Key Event:** Ria nearly kills Aris, but Angelica stops her because Aris is the only one who knows the codes for the Foundation blast doors.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Makes the pragmatic, "Vane-like" decision to value a monster’s utility over justice for a child.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "A death is a tragedy, Miss Ward. Data is eternal. Which one saves the human race? Do the math."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Put him down, Ria. We need his brain."
