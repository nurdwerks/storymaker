## I. Role in the Story

Quartermaster Flint is an old war buddy of General Ironwood who now manages the legion’s logistics. He represents the old guard who view any civilian as a "liability."

- **The History:** He and Ironwood share stories of campaigns from twenty years ago, using their shared past to lock Angelica out of any conversation.
- **The Liability:** He treats Angelica as a drag on his supply lines. When she enters the room, the stories stop, and the silence is deafening—a physical reminder that she does not belong in their brotherhood.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 26: The Forging of Wrath](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2050-2070)
- **Defining Quote:** "I didn't sign up for slaughter, General." (Reveals flaw: SLOTH/OLD GUARD CONSCIENCE)
