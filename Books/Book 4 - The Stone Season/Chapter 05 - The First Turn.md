## Chapter 05: The First Turn

### Scene 1: The Observation Room

- **Key Event:** Angelica Ward, accompanied by Dr. Aris and Ria, monitors the external security feed of the stairwell from the relative safety of the laboratory. They focus on the body of Lord Vermillion, who fell to his death (or so they thought) hours ago.
- **Detailed Description:** The observation monitor is grainy, a low-light thermal feed flickering in green and black. Vermillion's body lies crumpled at the base of the landing, limbs twisted at impossible angles. However, the thermal signature is wrong. Instead of cooling to ambient temperature (a freezing -10°C), the body is glowing white-hot. Aris points to the heat blooming in the chest cavity and spreading along the spinal column. It looks like a fever burning at 108°F. The body is not decomposing; it is cooking from the inside out.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a knot of dread in her stomach. She knew Vermillion. He was vain, yes, but he was human. Seeing his body defying the laws of death makes the threat visceral. She realizes that their barricade is not just keeping out the cold, but something far worse.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Why is he glowing? He's been dead for six hours. He should be ice."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "He's not alive. He's incubating. The heat is metabolic byproduct. Massive cellular regeneration."

### Scene 2: The Twitch

- **Key Event:** Vermillion’s corpse undergoes a violent "reactivation." His muscles spasm, snapping his broken bones back into a functional, if mangled, alignment.
- **Detailed Description:** On the screen, the body jerks. A shoulder that was dislocated pops back into the socket with a visual shudder. The neck, broken in the fall, straightens with a series of wet cracks. It is not healing; it is mechanical realignment. The flesh tears as the bones force themselves into place. The movement is jerky, puppet-like, lacking the fluidity of life. Aris watches with fascination, recording the timestamps on his datapad.
- **Internal Conflict:** Ria turns away from the screen, revulsion plain on her face. She has seen death in the arena, but this violation of the body offends her warrior's code. To her, a dead enemy should stay dead. Aris, conversely, is delighted by the data, his fear eclipsed by curiosity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "Turn it off. That's not... that's not right. Things don't bend that way."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "The virus reactivates the nervous system. It jump-starts the engine. But there's no driver. It repairs structural damage by sacrificing long-term viability. It's burning the furniture to heat the house."

### Scene 3: The Eyes

- **Key Event:** The confrontation.
- **Detailed Description:** Hatcher steps forward. He doesn't draw his weapon. He just looks at the gang leader with bored, tired eyes.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Hatcher:** "Three seconds. That's how long you have to decide if this is worth dying for."
- **Key Event:** The Iron Wall.
- **Detailed Description:** **General Ironwood** (carried by Zephyr) raises his pistol. Even crippled, his aim is steady.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **General Ironwood:** "Flank left, Night. Hatcher, center. I have the high ground. Drop them."
- **Key Event:** The hesitation.
- **Detailed Description:** The gang leader looks at Hatcher's confidence. He looks at Ironwood's discipline. He realizes this isn't a group of refugees. It's a squad. He lowers his rusty pipe.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Gang Leader:** "Not worth the ammo. Keep the trash." They do not blink. They do not scan. They simply stare. The black fluid ("The Blight") weeps from his tear ducts, staining his cheeks like mascara. He tilts his head, sniffing the air, sensing something the camera cannot pick up.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica feels a profound sadness seeing the ruin of a man she once saw at court. It is the ultimate erasure of identity. The "person" is gone, replaced by a biological imperative. She realizes that if she dies out there, she won't just end; she will become this.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Observes the loss of humanity in a man she previously knew as a noble, steeling herself against the horror to analyze the threat.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "They don't see. They sense. Pheromones. Heat. Resonance. They are hunting dogs. And we are the fox."

### Scene 4: The Hunt

- **Key Event:** A refugee, a young man from Sector 4 who had been hiding in a maintenance alcove, attempts to sneak past the creature. Vermillion attacks with explosive speed.
- **Detailed Description:** The refugee moves silently, but Vermillion spins instantly. The creature that was once a sluggish noble launches itself across the landing. It tackles the man, driving him to the concrete. Vermillion does not punch; he bites. He tears the man's throat out with a savagery that sprays blood across the lens of the camera. The refugee thrashes for seconds, then goes still. Vermillion begins to feed, tearing strips of flesh to consume the calories immediately.
- **Internal Conflict:** Angelica forces herself to watch. She needs to know what they are dealing with. She notes the strength, the speed, the lack of hesitation. This is not a mindless zombie; it is a hyper-efficient predator. She feels a cold rage at Vane for creating this.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Dr. Aris:** "Fuel. High-calorie intake required for the metabolic surge. The virus burns energy at 500% the normal rate. If they don't eat, they digest their own organs. They are starving from the moment they wake up."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Death is just a pause. Just a pause before the hunger starts."

- **Key Event:** The transformed Vermillion finishes feeding and stands up. He throws his head back and emits a high-pitched shriek—a sound that distorts the audio feed.
- **Detailed Description:** The scream is multi-tonal, sounding like metal scraping on glass. It echoes up and down the stairwell. In the distance, other screams answer. It is a signal. A dinner bell. The pack is forming.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ria:** "He's calling them. He's telling them where the food is."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Seal the vents. Weld the door. They're coming."

### Scene 5: The Refugees

- **Key Event:** High-value survivors arrive.
- **Detailed Description:** As they work to reinforce the barricades, **Lady Corinne (The Porcelain Doll)** emerges from the emergency stairwell, her once-pristine gown torn and bloodied. Behind her stumbles **Baron Gilded**, his golden monocle cracked, his arrogant demeanor replaced by naked fear. Both survived the initial outbreak by hiding in Corinne's panic room, but the power failure forced them to flee.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "Don't just stand there gaping—help us! The lower levels are overrun!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Lady Corinne:** "Don't just stand there gaping—help us! The lower levels are overrun!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Baron Gilded (shaking):** "They ate Lord Vance. They ATE him. Right in front of me. My credits mean nothing to them."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Joyce:** (Shuffling in behind them, clutching her knitting bag) "It was dreadful, truly. Poor Vance. He always was a bit tough, I imagine. Not much marbling."

- **Character Defining Moment:** **Lady Corinne** — Even in crisis, she maintains command presence, immediately assessing Angelica's group as the best chance for survival.
