# Character Profile: Scrap

**Archetype:** The Loyal Pet / The Scrap-Heap Companion
**True Sin:** ENVY (He mimics Hatcher's movements, silently wishing he was more than just a collection of discarded parts).
**Virtue Mask:** LOYALTY (He frames his following of Hatcher as "Operational Consistency").

## I. Role in the Story

Scrap is a small, jittery robot Hatcher built from Silt-trash. He represents the "soul" Hatcher tries to hide—the part of him that still wants to create and protect.

- **The Companion:** He beeps softly when Hatcher is sad and follows him like a stray dog, creating a domestic bond that Angelica cannot enter.
- **The Warning:** He makes a loud, static-filled clicking sound whenever Angelica gets too close to Hatcher, signaling that she is an "unauthorized occupant" in their shared life of salvage.

## II. Fundamental Change

- **The Event:** Absolute Shutdown / Destruction. During a raid on a Zenith data-vault, Scrap is used as a "logic-shield" to absorb a terminal virus meant for Hatcher. He succeeds but his personality matrix is completely erased, leaving only a hollow, beeping shell.
- **Impact on Hatcher:** Hatcher is devastated. He loses his "creation" and his only companion. This leads to a total emotional shutdown; he stops speaking to anyone and becomes a machine-like drifter who only cares about his next "fix" of salvage.
- **Impact on Entourage:** The "Spirit" of the crew is gone. The other members of the Null Crew stop trying to "humanize" their lives and become as cold and hollow as the scrap they scavenge, turning their community into a group of mourning ghosts.

## III. Book 4 Integration (The Stone Season)

- **Location:** Chapter 17 ("The Null Raid")
- **Scene:** "The Logic Shield." Scrap plugs himself into the console to absorb a "Logic-Spike" virus meant for Hatcher.
- **Role:** The Digital Martyr. His sacrifice signifies the loss of Hatcher’s "heart" and technical support.
- **Quote:** _"Beep-whirrr-sad-click."_ (His final sound before system wipe).
