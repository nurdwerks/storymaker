# Character Profile: Adjunct Professor Kroll

**Archetype:** The Intellectual Sycophant / The Tablet-Bearer
**True Sin:** PRIDE (He views his proximity to Vane's genius as his own, looking down on those with "lesser" minds).
**Virtue Mask:** SCHOLARSHIP (He frames his clinical cruelty as "Scientific Consensus").

## I. Role in the Story

Adjunct Professor Kroll is a sycophant who echoes Prelate Vane’s every sentiment. He is the man who translates Vane's radical ideas into bureaucratic reality.

- **The Behavior:** He laughs at Vane’s dry, intellectual jokes and carries the Prelate's tablet like a holy relic.
- **The Insult:** He points his stylus at Angelica as if she were a flawed equation that refuses to balance, treating her presence as a disruption to the "perfect" logic of the Directorate.

- **Event Location:** [Book 3, Chapter 32: Kaelen's Stand](file:///c:/Users/bryan/Documents/storymaker/Books/Book%203_%20The%20Game%20of%20Gears%20%28Original%20Terms%29.md#L2520-2540)
- **Defining Quote:** "I am redundant... The algorithm is 99.9% more efficient." (Reveals flaw: PRIDE/TOTAL SUBSERVIENCE)
