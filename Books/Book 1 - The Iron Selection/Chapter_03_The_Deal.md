## Chapter 3: The Deal

### Scene 1: The Ultimatum

- **Key Event:** The capture.
- **Detailed Description:** The raid on the crawlspace is not a battle; it is a seizure. The privacy of their hidden home is shattered in an instant. Two Wardens emerge from the shadows of the ventilation ducts. They are massive enforcers, clad in the pristine white ceramic-plate armor of the Zenith Guard, appearing like ghosts in the grime of the Silt. They are faceless behind polarized golden visors, and they move with the heavy, hydraulic whine of servo-assisted limbs. One warden grabs Angelica by the shoulder. She violent struggles, twisting and striking, but his grip is unyielding, like a steel vice clamping down on her bones. A third Warden drags Leo from the makeshift medical nest. Leo is limp, unconscious, his breath rattling in his crystallized lungs, a sound that tears at Angelica's heart.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Don't touch him! He's sick! You'll kill him! Get your hands off him!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Warden:** "Subject secured. Target acquired. Vital signs critical but stable."

- **Key Event:** The resistance.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica fights dirty, using every trick she learned in the scapes. She drops her weight and kicks the Warden's knee joint, aiming her boot heel directly at the exposed servo-actuator cabling. It sparks with a shower of blue light, and his grip loosens for a fraction of a second—just enough for her to slip free. She lunges toward Leo, desperation fueling her speed.

- **Key Event:** The counter.
- **Detailed Description:** Prelate Vane watches from the entryway, unimpressed by the frantic display of affection. He stands tall, his robes immaculate amidst the dust. He raises a gloved hand with the casual motion of a conductor. A cloud of black micro-drones—the Legion Swarm—erupts from his wrist gauntlet. They swarm Angelica like angry insects, forming magnetic bands around her wrists and ankles. With a magnetic pulse, they snap together, slamming her face-first onto the cold metal floor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Energy expended on resistance is energy subtracted from survival. Do the math, Miss Ward. You are good at math. I have seen your schematics."

### Scene 2: The Explanation

- **Key Event:** The science of magic.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane walks over to where she lies pinned. His silver mask reflects her terrified, smudged face. He crouches down, not to comfort her, but to inspect his acquisition. He speaks calmly, his voice modulated and smooth. He explains the nature of their reality. The Zenith runs on Resonance—background radiation emitted by the planet's unstable engine core. It is the lifeblood of their society. Some people, the genetic elite, absorb it and channel it (Mages). Most people, the Silt dwellers, absorb it and rot (Sickness).

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Prelate Vane** — Reveals his worldview. He is not cruel for the sake of cruelty; that would be emotional, and emotions are inefficient. He is a scientist. He views inefficiency as sin. He sees people not as souls, but as biological machines.

- **Key Event:** Leo's condition.
- **Detailed Description:** He gestures to Leo, who is being held upright by the third Warden. A medical scanner drone hovers over the boy, projecting a holographic skeletal map in the air. The lungs glow with a harsh red warning light.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "His lungs are crystallizing. It isn't a disease, Miss Ward. It is an incompatibility. His genetics reject the atmosphere of this planet. He is allergic to the world. Without a Grade-A clean-room environment, he has forty-eight hours before he asphyxiates on his own breath."

- **Key Event:** The Null.
- **Detailed Description:** He turns back to Angelica. He explains what she is, why he has come down into the filth to find her. She is a "Null." She has zero Resonance exposure. The dense Silt filters out the radiation, and her unique physiology rejects the rest. To him, she is a blank slate—a rarity in a world saturated with magical noise.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "I don't want a natural-born mage who thinks power is their birthright. They are arrogant. They are messy. They rely on instinct. I want a mage I can code. You are a formatted hard drive, Miss Ward. I intend to write my own operating system onto you."

### Scene 3: The Choice

- **Key Event:** The calculation.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane makes the offer, laying it out like a business contract. Join the Iron Selection—the brutal testing ground for the Zenith Guard. Twelve squads enter; one squad graduates. The mortality rate is 88%.

  - _Internal Monologue:_ Angelica runs the numbers in her head, the math coming naturally even in her panic. Staying here means Leo dies (100% probability). Fighting the Wardens means she dies (99% probability). Joining the Selection gives her a chance (12%).
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — She stops crying. The tears literally stop flowing. Her face goes cold and still. She replaces fear with mathematics. 12% is infinitely higher than 0%. It is a solvable equation.

- **Key Event:** The negotiation.
- **Detailed Description:** She manages to sit up, despite the magnetic shackles. She looks Vane dead in the eye, refusing to be cowed by his mask or his power.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I have conditions."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** (Amused) "You are in magnetic shackles, on your knees in the dirt, and yet you haggle. Proceed."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "He gets a window. He likes the sky. He's never seen the real sky, just the smog. And I want proof of life sent to my datapad every morning. If I don't get a video—timestamped and verified—I stop fighting. I stop eating. I die, and you lose your blank slate."

- **Key Event:** The agreement.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane smiles behind the mask. He appreciates leverage; it makes people predictable. A volunteer who is fighting for something is more valuable than a conscript who is fighting for nothing.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Prelate Vane:** "Agreed. A window facing the nebula. And a daily feed. See? We are negotiating already. You have the soul of a politician, Miss Ward."

### Scene 4: The Goodbye

- **Key Event:** The separation.
- **Detailed Description:** Vane snaps his fingers. The transaction is complete. The Wardens pick up Leo like he weighs nothing. They carry him toward a hovering medical shuttle that has docked at the open wall panel—a sleek, white vessel that looks alien in the rusty crawlspace. Angelica is dragged in the opposite direction, toward a gold elevator aimed at the Zenith Spire.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Let me say goodbye! Just one second! Leo!"
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Warden:** "Negative. Schedule is absolute. Transport initiating."

- **Key Event:** The message.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica rips one hand free from the magnetic bind, tearing her skin in the process. She pulls out her cracked, scavenged datapad. She blindly types a message, her fingers flying over the keys, hitting send just as the elevator doors close on Leo's shuttle, cutting off her view of him.

  - _Message Text:_ "I'm going to work. Big job. Don't worry about me. Be good. Eat your greens. I will buy the sky for you. - Angie"

- **Key Event:** The transformation.
- **Detailed Description:** The gold elevator ascends, rising swiftly through the layers of the city. The Silt falls away below her, a brown ocean of misery and rust. Above, the Zenith shines like a promise and a threat—a city of glass and light. Angelica Ward—Scavenger Prince of Sector 12—stands up in the elevator car. She checks her reflection in the polished brass. She wipes the blood from her lip. She fixes her torn tunic. She takes all her fear, all her grief, and pushes it down into a dark, cold place in her gut. She locks it away.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — The internal shift is palpable. The scavenger dies; the cadet is born. She is no longer surviving for herself; she is a weapon forged for a purpose.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ambition is just survival with a better haircut. If they want a monster... I'll build them one. And then I'll burn their house down."
