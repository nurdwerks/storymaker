### Scene 1: The Void

- **Key Event:** The Zenith dome collapses, and gravity dampeners fail throughout the Spire, throwing the city into a catastrophic "Great Fall."

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "I am alive. I am broken, but I am here."

- **Key Event:** Angelica finds herself drifting in the debris of the Golden Palace, witnessing the absolute silence of the Spire’s resonance engine stopping.

### Scene 2: The Anchor

- **Key Event:** Angelica is tethered via a high-tensile cable to Zephyr, whose magnetic boots are locked onto a structural beam.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Zephyr** — Is found unconscious and hanging upside down, with his expensive cybernetic arm ("gold and brass masterpiece") hanging uselessly.
  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Shakes Zephyr awake, refusing to face the void alone.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Wake up, you shiny idiot. Come on. I can't do this alone. Wake up."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Zephyr:** "Princess? Did we win?"

### Scene 3: The View

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Zephyr witness the scale of the disaster: the Palace Spire has punched through the floor of the upper decks, falling toward the Undercity.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "The Great Fall. The day the sky would fall and crush the poor. It wasn't a metaphor. It was physics."

### Scene 4: The Realization

- **Key Event:** Angelica realizes the hierarchy of the world has inverted—the Zenith is no longer at the top but is become the ammunition falling on the bottom.

  - _Character Defining Moment:_ **Angelica Ward** — Takes on the command edge she will need, transitioning from a broken survivor to a leader focused on descent.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We didn't fall from grace. We fell from orbit."
  - _Key Dialog_ **Angelica Ward:** "Ready to go home, rat?"

- **Key Event:** Angelica and Zephyr unclip their tethers and drop into the darkness toward Sector 12.
