## Chapter 26: The Engine

### Scene 1: The Install

- **Key Event:** The Object.
- **Detailed Description:** The day has finally arrived. The "Star-Tear Drive," salvaged from the _Aeterna_'s original wreckage and rebuilt over two decades, is ready for installation. It is the heart of the ship.
- **Key Event:** The Appearance.
- **Detailed Description:** It hangs from the main crane, suspended by fifty separate chains. It is ugly. A massive cylinder of patched titanium, wrapped in hand-wound copper coils, glowing with the internal, sickly light of Vane's crystal shards. It looks like a bomb made by a madman.
- **Key Event:** The Sound.
- **Detailed Description:** Even inactive, it hums. A low, thrumming vibration that makes teeth ache and dust dance on the floorplates.
- **Key Event:** The Command.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands on the gantry, megaphone in hand.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Steady! Lower it slow! Millimeters, people! This isn't a playful drop!"
- **Key Event:** The Strain.
- **Detailed Description:** The winch-men are sweating. The gears of the crane groan under the impossible weight.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Winch-man:** "It's heavy! The gears are stripping!"
- **Key Event:** The Stakes.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica leans over the rail.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Hold it! If you drop it, you crack the planet! That core contains a singularity's worth of anger! Treat it like it's made of glass!"

### Scene 2: The Danger

- **Key Event:** The Snap.
- **Detailed Description:** _PING._ A sharp sound cuts through the noise of the construction. One of the main retaining chains snaps. The metal was fatigued, the rust too deep.
- **Key Event:** The Swing.
- **Detailed Description:** The engine lurches. Five tons of unstable physics begins to swing like a wrecking ball. It smashes into the wooden scaffolding on the left. Wood splinters. Men scream and scramble for safety.
- **Key Event:** The Trajectory.
- **Detailed Description:** It swings back toward the delicate mounting bracket. If it hits the bracket, it will crush the alignment couplings, and the ship will never fly.
- **Key Event:** The Heroics.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar sees it happening. He doesn't shout. He acts. He grabs a long iron pry-bar lying on the deck.
- **Key Event:** The Interception.
- **Detailed Description:** He jams the bar between the swinging engine and the wall. He braces his shoulder against it.
- **Key Event:** The Feat.
- **Detailed Description:** He leans into it. His muscles bulge, tearing his tunic. Veins pop in his neck like ropes. He is fighting gravity. He is fighting momentum. For a second, it looks like he will be crushed.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** (Roaring) "GUIDE IT!"
- **Key Event:** The Alignment.
- **Detailed Description:** The engine slows, its momentum arrested by his brute strength. It hangs directly over the bracket.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Ragnar:** "DROP IT NOW!"
- **Key Event:** The Finish.
- **Detailed Description:** The winch-men release the brake. _CLANG._ The engine settles into its mount with a sound like a bank vault closing. The entire ship shudders.
- **Key Event:** The Collapse.
- **Detailed Description:** Ragnar drops the bent pole. He collapses to his knees, gasping for air, sweat pouring off him. He saved the mission.

- **Detailed Description:** Torin puts his hand near the casing. He pulls it back instinctively.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "Hot. It radiates even through the shielding."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "It feels like a sleeping dragon. Breathing."
- **Key Event:** The Check.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica runs to the console. She checks the gauges. The needles are dancing in the red zone.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "It is a dragon. And we just woke it up."
- **Key Event:** The Status.
- **Detailed Description:** She taps the glass of the containment monitor.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Magnetic containment is at 98%. It's holding. But the field is unstable. It's hungry."

- **Key Event:** The Next Step.

  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We have an engine. But an engine is useless without gas. It's just a heater."
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Torin:** "The fuel."
- **Key Event:** The Requirement.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica nods. She points to the floor, toward the earth itself.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "We need the Magma. We need to tap the volcano. That's the next step. Feeding the beast. We have to drill straight down into the mantle."

- **Key Event:** The Order.
- **Detailed Description:** Angelica stands up. Her face is a mask of fury and grief.
  - _Key Dialog:_ **Angelica Ward:** "Get a medic! And get a backup seal on that valve! We are not losing this ship! Not after this! No more mistakes!"

- **Detailed Description:** She looks at the engine. It isn't just a machine anymore. It is a blood altar.
